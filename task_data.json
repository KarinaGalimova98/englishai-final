    "text": "You are going to read an article written by a young pianist. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Berrak: A pianist I started playing the piano when I was four years old. My mother thought it would be a good outlet for positive childish energy and I was really into it; it was exciting. It was something different and I had much more time to practise then. The first time I performed in front of an audience was when I was five years old and I loved it. I went on a summer camp run by my piano teachers at the time and at the end of the week we all got up and played a piece. At that age I was unaware of any of the pressure associated with performing live so it just felt nice to have people concentrating on my playing and I liked the applause and attention. Now I perform regularly, often in front of large audiences, and I still really enjoy it. I always knew I wanted to be a pianist and never thought I would do anything else. In that respect I felt different from my friends when I went to school; they all thought they wanted to become teachers or doctors and things like that and I just knew I would be a pianist but it didn’t feel strange. Finding time to play and practise wasn’t a problem at school until my last few years when the pressure of exams and things was hard, but generally I would choose to practise instead of doing homework. It always felt like schoolwork got in the way of playing the piano rather than the other way around. Unfortunately I was never given any special allowances or extended deadlines though. After I finished school I went on to study a degree in music and now I’m studying a Masters degree in accompaniment. A typical day now involves a couple of hours practice in the morning before going into college and attending classes. I spend a lot of time in the library listening to music, trying to learn and become familiar with new pieces of music. One downside to choosing to study and pursue a career in music is that you end up spending hours and hours by yourself. However, I also try to spend time at college meeting other people and networking. The more musicians I know the more likely I am to be asked to play for others. The more I play the better known I become and in the music business it’s all about recognition and getting your name out there. It's important to get involved in as many performances as possible and take part in competitions so that as many people as possible see you perform and know who you are. It’s a very competitive industry. Ultimately, if I am asked to play and get given a job it means that someone else loses work and sometimes it feels like a constant battle. You can’t help being drawn into an artificial world where you are constantly comparing yourself to others and are always worried about what others think of your performances. In the real world outside of college your audience is much wider. I chose to get involved in accompaniment because as much as I love playing the piano I also enjoy working with others. And working as an accompanist is a good way of doing that. There are also more job opportunities as although there is still a lot of competition other performers will always need good accompanists, so there is more demand. I really enjoy performing with other people because there’s an even greater sense of achievement when you are both on form and a piece comes out amazingly. To follow a career in music you have to have a real passion for it as unfortunately it’s not a very secure path and it’s not usually very well paid. Having said that, the real positive side is that I am doing something I love; it’s not just a subject to study. I love everything associated with music and performing and it’s what I do every day. Questions: 1. How did Berrak feel about playing the piano when she was very young? (A) She really enjoyed it. (B) She only did it because her mother wanted her to. (C) She didn’t like the fact she had to practice a lot. (D) She felt strange and different from her friends. 2. How did she feel the first time she performed in front of an audience? (A) nervous and under pressure (B) strange because everyone was looking at her (C) happy and relaxed (D) She was concentrating so much on playing she didn’t notice the audience. 3. Why did Berrak feel different from her friends when she was at school? (A) Because the teachers gave her less homework. (B) Because her friends didn't know what career they wanted to follow. (C) Because she was the only one who wanted to become a musician. (D) Because she found the pressure of exams less stressful. 4. Why does she say it is important to meet and talk to other musicians at her college? (A) Because the music industry is very sociable and it’s important to have lots of friends. (B) Because she feels lonely after spending so much time by herself. (C) Because other musicians in the college are very supportive of each other. (D) Because it increases her possibilities of being asked to perform. 5. When she says in line 22 that ‘in the music business it’s all about recognition and getting your name out there’ what does she mean? (A) It’s important that people know who she is when they see her photograph. (B) It’s important that lots of people know what she does and know her name. (C) Her name is more important than the way she plays. (D) Her name needs to be easy for people to recognise and remember. 6. Why does the college environment often feel like a constant battle? (A) Because there isn’t enough work for everyone. (B) Because she doesn’t get on with the other students there. (C) Because there are lots of competitions. (D) Because the teachers are always comparing the students and deciding who is better. 7. Why did Berrak decide to go into accompaniment? (A) Because she thinks it can be more challenging. (B) Because it’s better paid. (C) Because she can achieve more and become more well-known. (D) Because she likes working as part of a team. 8. What does she say is the best thing about studying and pursuing a career in music? (A) She could become rich and famous. (B) There are lots of job opportunities. (C) She spends all her time doing something she loves. (D) She finds it an easy subject."

    "text": "You are going to read an article by retired lawyer and keen cook John Griffiths. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Cooking for friends. Choosing the degree I should study for at university was quite difficult for me as there were two careers that I found equally attractive: the law and catering. After much soul searching, I realised that whilst I could be a lawyer during the day and then enjoy cookery as a form of relaxation, the reverse was not true. Thus, I opted for a law degree and made food and wine my number one hobby. I have never regretted this decision. Working as a lawyer provided a good living and allowed me enough spare time to indulge myself by enjoying some very fine food and wines at many superb restaurants. A life in catering would have meant that I would always have been working when my friends were playing and vice versa. The hours that have to be worked by chefs are quite ridiculous. They have to arrive at their restaurant by mid-morning, at the latest, to prepare for lunch. They work all afternoon dealing with the business side of their establishment and developing new recipes. Then, they must prepare for evening service probably crawling into bed in the small hours of the next morning feeling absolutely shattered! Sharing my love of fine food and wines with good friends in the relaxed atmosphere of my home has more than compensated for not owning a restaurant. Being a professional chef probably would have meant that, by now, I would be sick of the sight of food, much as I am completely turned off by the merest mention of anything to do with the law! Planning a meal for people I love is a great pleasure. I have a vast collection of cookery books and I am an avid fan of many a TV chef. The problem I have, therefore, is choosing what to cook from so many different possibilities. How do I choose? Well, that depends very much on the friends. A starting point has to be catering for their own likes and dislikes and trying to avoid serving them the same dishes as last time they visited. I don’t claim to be anything other than an enthusiastic amateur but quite a few friends appear to be daunted by the prospect of cooking for me. They seem to think that some of the food I produce is better than they can do and, not wanting to appear to be a show-off or to overwhelm them, I sometimes hold back and cook something simpler than the more adventurous fare I might really have wanted to try. The friends I like cooking for most of all are those who share the love of food and wine as much as I do and who are quite happy to reciprocate, in grand style, when I pay them a return visit. Generally, my cooking has become less complex and pretentious over the years and, although I use recipe books and TV chefs as inspiration, I tend to find that the best way of deciding what to cook is to see what is available when I do the shopping. Years ago, I would have retired early to bed with a great heap of books around me, ploughing through them trying to find recipes that would be seasonal, suitable and impressive only to find that, when I visited the shops, many of the ingredients I needed were either unavailable or not very good. Nowadays, I tend to do the reverse: what I cook is controlled by what I have been able to buy. I might have had one or two vague ideas but, more often than not, I am scrabbling through pages of recipes trying to find something new to do with some scallops, a leg of lamb and a punnet of raspberries. I nearly always buy some creme fraiche, a bunch of coriander and some seasonal vegetables. My store cupboard is pretty good and I can usually find all the spices I need, together with onions, garlic, chillies and boring stuff like flour, butter and so on. I strongly believe that if you have good ingredients you will be able to turn out something worth eating. At the end of a meal there is nothing better than settling down with a strong espresso and a dish of the very best chocolates. The very best of friends can normally provide entertaining conversation but, to me, the finest compliment I can be paid is that they aren’t afraid of gently nodding off. It shows that they feel satisfied, relaxed and happy as a result of my efforts. A: How do you fit a decent social life into that sort of existence? B: The choices I make depend not only on the wines that might best complement the food but also upon the preferences of my guests. C: However, it was the luxury of having the time to cook for friends at home that underlined the good sense of the decision I had made. D: Another factor is their attitude to their own cooking skills. E: It is not unusual for me to simply make everything up as I go along! F: It is one of the great joys of my life and cooking has remained fun. G: This means that, very often, I don’t know what I am giving my friends until a few hours before they arrive. H: For these friends, I like to pull out all the stops!"

    "text": "You are going to read an article in which five people talk about why they enjoy camping. For questions 16-30 choose from the people (A-E). The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: likes being in the open air surrounded by wildlife? gives some advice on things you should take with you? gives an example of people working together to solve a difficult situation? is looking for variety when he/she goes on holiday? doesn’t want to meet the people he/she works with when on holiday? mentions something you can’t do on campsites? has enjoyed camping for many years? likes to make last-minute decisions about where to go on holiday? talks about making friends while staying at campsites? mentions a possible problem when arriving at campsites? says they can’t choose when they go away on holiday? has been to the same campsite more than once? sees price as a main priority? The Joys of Camping. Camping has been a popular choice for holiday accommodation for a long time but it seems that now its popularity is on the increase. Kate Reilly speaks to 5 dedicated campers and finds out why they prefer to pitch their tents or park their camper vans rather than stay in hotels or rent apartments. A Ben: a teacher. For Ben the most important thing is to find a cheap and affordable option during the busy school holidays. ‘Because I have to go away during the peak season when all the schools are on holiday it’s often difficult to find cheap hotel deals or holidays flats for rent,’ he explains. In addition to this he enjoys the flexibility camping offers. ‘I’m not that good at planning ahead and like to be spontaneous with my travel plans. The fact that it’s not usually necessary to pre-book to stay at a campsite suits me very well. I also like that I can go away to more obscure and remote places and get away from the students I spend all year in the classroom with. D Eli and Catriona: doctor and medical researcher. Eli and Catriona explain why camping is the perfect holiday for families. ‘We used to go camping when we were much younger, before we had children and loved it but now we have the boys it makes even more sense. There are so many child-friendly campsites with swimming pools and special activities for kids. It’s so nice for them to have lots of space to run around in and other children to play with. It also means we have time ourselves to really relax. We’ve actually been to the same campsite for 2 years in a row now as we all had such a good time there the first year. The boys are still in touch with friends they made there last year so we might well go back again this year. C Matt: IT engineer. Matt likes to spend his holiday seeing lots of different places. ‘I’m a restless person so when I go away on holiday I don’t like to be tied down to one place; camping means you can stay for two nights in one place then pack up the tent, jump in the car and stay somewhere else for the next night or two and so on with no need to book ahead. It’s a great way to see lots of different places in a short period of time.’ He also points out that, ‘You obviously need a car to really be able to make the most of your time and make sure you have a good map and a good up-to-date campsite guide with clear directions to help you find the different campsites. Campsites are often not well signposted and there is nothing more frustrating than driving around for hours looking for a campsite when you’d rather be relaxing. Cathy: finance director. Cathy is looking for a contrast from her stressful working life when she goes on holiday. She says, ‘I love being outside and the freedom camping offers. I spend all day in the office when I'm at work and have to be very organised to meet tight deadlines, so when I'm on holiday I like to be in the fresh air and be able to do exactly what I want when I want; camping is perfect for that. Of course there are some rules you have to respect like you’re not allowed to make noise after 11 or 12 at night but I like that. I love going to sleep listening to nature.' E Melissa and Stefano: salon manager and marketing director. Melissa and Stefano travel around Europe in their campervan and every year they meet many interesting people and make friends with people from all over the world. Everyone is always so helpful when you stay on a campsite. If you need to borrow something like matches your neighbours will always help you out. One year they got the back wheels of the campervan stuck in the sand and it took ten of their new neighbours to help push it out. Everyone came rushing over to help as soon as they saw there was a problem and most of them didn’t even speak the same language. It was a wonderful feeling; you don’t get that in hotels."

    "image_description": "Candidate A - Top Image: The first person appears to be lying down on a grassy area near the water. They are dressed in formal clothes, with their arms stretched out and lying on their stomach. The scene suggests a peaceful and calm environment, possibly after a busy period, where the individual is taking a break or enjoying the surrounding nature. The view of the sea and green grass offers a serene atmosphere that encourages relaxation and unwinding. Bottom Image: The second image shows three people lying on their backs on a grassy field, likely after a hike or camping. They have outdoor equipment like sleeping mats (blue and purple) near them, suggesting they are resting after a long walk or exploring the mountains. The mountainous landscape in the background emphasizes the outdoor adventure and the need to relax in such a tranquil setting. The relaxed postures and the fact that they are in a natural, open space show they are taking a break from their activity to rest and enjoy the view. Question: Why do you think the people are relaxing in these places?. Candidate B - The image consists of two different scenes, both involving cars and their significance to the people in them. Question: \"How important do you think the cars are to these people?\" Top Image: The first image shows a man in a uniform, likely a chauffeur or a driver, sitting in the front seat of a car. He is looking directly at the camera, tipping his cap, which indicates a friendly and professional demeanor. The interior of the car is visible, showing a typical car dashboard. His role seems to involve driving others, suggesting that the car is an essential part of his job and a primary tool for his profession. His interaction with the car, as seen through his pose and gesture, shows the car is a vital aspect of his work. Bottom Image: The second image features a race car driver standing beside his car, which is parked on snow-covered ground. He is dressed in a racing suit, wearing gloves and a helmet, ready for the race. The car, labeled with the number \"2,\" appears to be a competition vehicle, emphasizing the importance of the car in his profession. The car seems to be central to the driver's career, and it is implied that it plays a crucial role in his success. His body language, as he prepares for the race, indicates that the car is an indispensable part of his life, directly tied to his identity as a driver. Both individuals rely heavily on their cars, but in different contexts — one for professional driving and the other for competitive racing."

Emily woke up before her alarm went off and knew instantly something wasn’t quite right in the house. Bailey, her chocolate-coloured pet Labrador, should have been there at the bedroom door demanding food but there was no sound of him. She decided to get up and go and see where he was. It felt cold in the hall but she knew she had left the heating on last night. As she walked down the stairs she heard a noise in the kitchen; the strange feeling that something was wrong was getting stronger. What was going on? She got to the bottom of the stairs and opened the door to the living room, which led to the kitchen. Why was the door closed? She always left it open. Bailey was nowhere to be seen and his toys, which were usually all over the living room floor, were in a neat pile in the corner next to his basket. Had they been there when she had gone to bed last night? She couldn’t remember. She walked into the kitchen and turned the light on, it didn’t work, nothing happened. She stood very still and listened, nothing. There wasn’t a sound. That was really strange; she lived in the middle of a busy city, there were always people around. She woke up to the sound of traffic, car horns, police cars, her neighbours shouting in the house next door, how could there be silence at 8 o’clock on a Friday morning? She went back into the living room and turned the TV on, but again nothing happened. She went back into the kitchen and looked out of the window; it was a bright clear day. The back door was shut but when she tried the handle she realised it was unlocked. She walked out into the tiny back garden and opened the back gate; still nothing, not a sound and no sign of Bailey. She called him but he didn’t come. She went back into the house and called her mother. No answer. She called her boyfriend but his mobile was switched off. She tried a couple of other numbers but with equal success. She sat down on the sofa and thought about what to do. Just as she decided the best thing would be to stay at home and wait, there was a loud banging on the front door. She jumped up and ran to the door. 'Who is it?' she shouted. 'It’s me,' came the reply. But she had no idea who 'me' was. She walked back into the living room and tried to look through the front window to see who was standing there. It was a man but she couldn’t make out who he was; he didn’t look familiar. He was tall and was wearing a big coat with a hood. She saw that the man had Bailey with him, and Bailey seemed quite happy. She still wasn’t taking any chances though; she put the safety latch on the door and opened it just enough. It was her brother, who lived a few streets away. She opened the door and let him in. Bailey was excited. 'So what’s going on?' she asked. He looked at her strangely: 'Haven’t you heard?' Questions: 1. How did Emily know there was something wrong? (A) Alarm didn’t go off (B) Dog wasn’t there (C) Dog was quiet (D) She woke up early. 2. How did she feel when opening the living room door? (A) confused (B) excited (C) annoyed (D) strong. 3. What could she hear in the kitchen? (A) traffic (B) silence (C) television (D) garden noise. 4. Why did she go into the garden? (A) weather (B) talk to neighbours (C) find Bailey (D) make call. 5. Who did she speak to on the phone? (A) mother (B) boyfriend (C) two friends (D) no one. 6. Why did she return to the living room after the knock? (A) didn’t want to leave (B) see who it was (C) avoid talking (D) think what to do. 7. Why did she think she knew the man? (A) recognised clothes (B) Bailey barked (C) Bailey was relaxed (D) recognised voice. 8. What does 'not taking any chances' mean?

    "text": "Part 2 You are going to read an article in which stage manager Adam James talks about his work in technical theatre. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Technical Theatre When we go to the theatre we go to see the actors and their performance; the stage is the central focus point; it is where everything happens, or at least everything that we the audience are supposed to see. But there is so much more to putting on a performance than just the acting cast. There is a whole team of people who we never see but without whom no production would be possible. We spoke to Adam James who has worked in technical theatre since the age of 14 to find out what goes on behind the scenes and how he got involved. I was 12 years old when I first saw a show in my local leisure centre. I was fascinated by the fact that everything came in about ten lorries and they basically built a theatre from scratch. I 9 I 1 I got to know some of the people working on the stage management team and they let me shadow them while they worked. I met the stage manager and after watching the team work and talking to him I decided that was what I wanted to do as a job. I didn’t know anything about work in the theatre industry so I started studying and learning about the job. I 10 I l However, what I really wanted was to get involved and start working as part of a stage management team. Once I was 14 I managed to get some work experience and I started to miss school sometimes and go to work at the theatre instead. I left school when I was 16 and because I had quite a lot of experience I was able to get a job as an assistant stage manager in a theatre in London. I worked there for about a year and then did some freelance work in Cornwall and went on tours around the country. I 11 I 1 Working on tour was intense but really good fun. A typical Monday would see us arrive at about 8 o’clock in the morning and open up the lorries. We would have some coffee and then when everyone had arrived we would spend the day building the show. In the afternoon the cast would arrive and I would show them around so they knew where they could make quick costume changes and things like that. I 12 1 1 Once the show had started it was just a case of watching and supervising and letting the show happen around us. As stage manager I was always the first and the last person on stage. Working on tour can be stressful as you have to keep track of where everyone is for health and safety reasons and monitor everything that goes on back stage and keep to time. Then once the show is over you have to check everything and make a note of everything that needs repairing or re-doing before the next performance. After a couple of years touring I decided to return to London and go to college to study technical theatre. I studied for a year but I realised that it wasn’t very useful to me. I had learnt a lot more from my years working. 13 1 I I felt like I was already established in the industry so I decided to leave college and got a job in a theatre. When finding work in technical theatre first hand experience is much more important than qualifications. I 14 I I did some more freelance work in London for a while and now I work for a production company. You can have up to 20 people working on any one performance so there’s a real team spirit. There are people working in lighting, sound, wardrobe, wigs, props, carpentry and stage management. Apart from the technical side we also have to look after the actors. As stage manager it’s my job to meet and greet the cast on their first day and make sure they know where everything is and have everything they need. The hardest thing I’ve ever had to do was try to control 2,500 primary school children. I really like what I do. There are of course a number of disadvantages; I don’t like the hours and the disruption to my personal life that working evenings can cause. I 15 I I But I would highly recommend it to others; it’s very enjoyable and always different; you never have the same day twice and there’s something very exciting and beautiful about live theatre. A It was a course for people who didn’t know anything about the theatre. В The more I found out about technical theatre the more interested I became. С Also there’s quite a lot of instability and insecurity to the job and the money is not always good. D While the cast were getting ready we would get on with any necessary maintenance jobs. E I was very curious as I watched the whole thing being put together and I found it hugely exciting. F Working in a large theatre is much more difficult because there are so many more people to organise. G The work was quite sporadic but the money was good; in one month I could earn enough to last me six months. H Theatres are looking for people with proven ability and who know what they are doing, and what interests them the most on your CV is your last job."

I 29 I I didn’t enjoy the event as much as the preparation? ! 30 | | Raising money for charity Housewife and grandmother I abseiled off a cliff to raise money for charity. It was an enormous challenge as I’m actually quite afraid of heights. It was only really the moment of going over the edge that was difficult; after that it was very easy. You just have to get into the rhythm and not go too fast. My son is very into climbing and things like that and he and some of his friends from his university climbing club set everything up and organised the whole event. There were about twenty of us who did it and between us we raised well over the target amount. It was a great success but I don’t think I’ll be doing anything like that again. Once was enough! В Lawyer I ran a triathlon and managed to get over 50 people to sponsor me. I had to train for months and it was really hard work but well worth it. I actually enjoyed the training more than the final event because on the day the weather was terrible. In the months running up to the event I followed a very strict regime and it felt good to be working towards such a specific goal. I would often get up at 5 o’clock in the morning so I could train before going to work. Knowing that I was going to be able to give a large donation to charity made me even more determined to do it. It wasn’t compulsory to get sponsorship and giving money to charity wasn’t my main motivation when I first signed up to do it but I wanted to make the most of the opportunity and all my friends and family were really supportive and wanted to help and give money. It was such a positive experience I’m going to do it again next year. Theatre manager When I was a child I took part in a lot of sponsored walks. Each year my school would organise the walks and although it wasn’t compulsory my friends and I would always take part. It was fun. Each walk was about 15 km long so it took quite a long time but it was a nice way to spend a day. The first year I did it I was only 11 years old and my father came with us to keep an eye on us but once we were older we went by ourselves; there were about 8 or 9 of us that all walked together. We managed to get quite a bit of money between us; in fact it became our challenge to raise more money than the year before, which we always achieved, so there was a great sense of satisfaction. Retired primary school head teacher We used to make a big effort to get the children involved in charity events as I think it helps raise their awareness of world events and the fact that in many places there are people, particularly children like themselves, who live in very different circumstances to them. I think they get a great sense of satisfaction too from knowing that they are able to do something to help. Each year we had a mufti day; where all the children paid a small amount of money and then came to school for one day in their own clothes and not in school uniform. We also regularly held school fetes where the children were encouraged to donate old toys and books and things which we then sold. The children got involved in running the stalls too and all the money we made went to our chosen charity. Environmental consultant I cycled from L.A. to Quito last spring. All my family thought I was mad but I love cycling and I knew it would be an amazing way to see lots of really interesting places that most people never see. I managed to raise quite a bit of money for charity through sponsorship although that wasn't my main objective. I turned 30 in March and I really wanted to be doing something totally different rather than just sitting at my desk in the office. I wanted it to be different and something I could look back on when I am older and feel proud of. It is something I’ll be able to tell my grandchildren about and the fact that I was able to do something to help those less well off than me at the same time, well that made it even better."

    "text": "Being a Good Manager Being a good manager of people requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. All people are different and in a working environment there will always be a great mix of personalities and skills. I 9 I Like with everything in life though, experience brings knowledge and in my many years as both an employee and a manager in various charity organisations I have come to recognise the qualities and skills which make an efficient manager. I’ve worked with lots of different people in the past and I think I have experienced all sorts of different types of manager. There are those who are very controlling and always telling you what to do while at the other extreme there are others who are nowhere to be seen. I 10 I I think it’s important to let people work on their own and not interfere too much; ideally you want to promote assertiveness and self-confidence in your workers’ and if you are always watching over them and checking up on them they will not develop these skills. At the same time it is not helpful to leave your workers completely alone. The manager is there to oversee things and make sure everything runs smoothly, if employees have a problem or need help they should always be able to ask for it, and the manager should be able to provide it. A line manager who is not available to staff when they need them is of no use at all. To be an effective manager I think it is important to be optimistic and able to instil a positive attitude in the workforce; the worst kind of manager is one who allows or even encourages a bad feeling in the workplace. I 11 I As a result we all lacked confidence in the whole organisation and the office became a very negative environment to work in. It’s a manager’s responsibility to keep workers spirits high and create a pleasant atmosphere. Having a naturally optimistic and friendly personality helps. The best types of managers are those who can accept the responsibility they have been given. If something goes wrong a good manager will take the blame; they are responsible for the team and if the team, or any individual within it, is not performing well then it is ultimately the manager’s fault. I 12 I They must also then do all they can to solve any unsatisfactory situations and deal with dissatisfaction from higher up in the organisation on the team’s behalf. One thing which managers often do not do enough is give praise. Praise is a very effective management tool and should be exploited as much as possible. I 13 I Managers who give a lot of praise are also in a much better situation to criticise when work is not of a satisfactory standard. It is important that employees receive positive as well as negative feedback on their performance; the more feedback there is the more aware workers will be of what is expected of them and positive feedback helps increase motivation. Connected to this last point is the ability to judge on merit. Managers must be able to separate their personal feelings for individuals from their assessment of their work. It is really important to see team members’ actions objectively. Any feelings of favouritism or discrimination can be very harmful to the team. Managers need to be able to recognise the strengths and weaknesses of their employees and use them appropriately. This includes recognising their own strengths and weaknesses. I 14 I Managers need to be flexible in their approach to assigning work so that tasks are assigned to those best suited to doing them. I have worked for an organisation where work was given to individuals based on the time of the day they were available to work rather than their personal expertise; this not only resulted in the jobs not being done well and therefore reduced efficiency, but also great dissatisfaction among workers and clients. For example, someone with excellent computer skills but poor public speaking skills should not be asked to go into schools and universities to give presentations. At the same time it is essential to share knowledge and experience so that the team as a whole develop existing skills and individuals learn new ones. I 15 I As the manager learns new skills and gains useful information it is important that they share it with the team. The manager should not be doing tasks which could be done equally well by someone less qualified than themselves. Where possible managers should delegate and occupy themselves with higher level activities. However, it is also important that in times of crisis or when the team is exceptionally busy, the manager should not feel themselves too important to join in and do whatever job is necessary to help the situation. Finally, empathy is an enormously important quality when working as a manager of people. The basic rule of ‘treat others as you would expect others to treat you’ is fundamental. It’s important to try to put yourself in your colleagues’ situation and try and appreciate how they are feeling and then act accordingly. A This includes the manager passing on what they know. B They should never promise anything that is not possible as this will lead to disappointment and undermine confidence in the company. C Now that I work as a manager myself I try to be neither too controlling nor too distant. D Efficiently managing a team of people is no easy task and there will be many challenging moments. E In the past I have worked in an office where my line manager was constantly complaining about and criticising the directors of the company. F Managers should look for examples of good work and congratulate workers accordingly. G Managers choose and develop their team and so must accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good results of their efforts. H An efficient team makes the most of all the skills different individuals bring to it."

When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: has been a teacher the longest? |16| no longer works as a teacher? |17| has taught in many different countries? |18| mentions the qualities which are important to be a good teacher? |19| says they became a teacher because they were not happy in their previous job? |20| says they like working as a teacher because their job is always interesting? |21| |22| mentions a difficulty of their subject? |23| says they have had a number of different jobs? |24| says they were keen to share what they have learnt with others? |25| says that they had been interested in teaching from a young age? |26| says it’s easy for pupils to see the results of their work in her subject? |27| say they have taught adults as well as children and teenagers? |28| has helped and trained other teachers? |29| says the beginning of their career as a teacher was hard work? |30| A Career in Teaching A Anna I first got into teaching 4 years ago when I decided to quit my office job and do a bit of travelling. I’d heard of the CELTA qualification to teach English to adults and thought it would be a great way to see the world. I’d also been interested in teaching since I was at school and with the CELTA thought it would be a perfect combination - teaching and travel. Since completing the course I’ve spent time teaching in the UK, Austria, Poland and Spain and have loved every minute. I’ve taught people of all ages and levels. I’d say the main thing I enjoy about teaching is the fact that you’re able to engage with people from different countries, all of whom have different backgrounds and experiences, and I feel that this therefore makes teaching an interesting, varied profession. I think the thing I found the most frustrating was probably going into different schools and trying to teach children and teenagers who were not interested in learning English and only there because their parents had made them. However, this meant there was always a challenge in trying to find material that these students would be interested in and a job where you don’t have challenges I imagine would be rather boring. I’ve recently started working as a primary school teacher, which I’m really enjoying. I look back on my time teaching abroad with a lot of fondness and for this reason it is something I would definitely like to do again in the future. C Sally I have been teaching for 3 years now and decided to train to be a food technology teacher after working in the food industry for 5 years. I was fed up with working long hours, knowing the end result was making profit for the company I was working for at the time rather than giving me satisfaction. I have also always loved my subject - Home Economics, Food technology and Cookery - and wanted the opportunity to use my experience and knowledge to inspire and help others. Friends had put me off going into teaching previously due to the notorious heavy workload. It has been the most rewarding and challenging job of my career and I now couldn’t imagine doing anything else. I am lucky with my subject because progress and success are instant in practical cookery lessons; giving plenty of opportunity to praise pupils and raise their confidence. There have been very difficult times in my teaching career, especially the first year, when learning the work life balance was impossible to grasp; this in conjunction with challenging behaviour issues was a steep learning curve, but I am pleased I persevered. Over time teaching got easier and I think it is the most fulfilling, satisfying profession I could do. The odd pupil that walks out of the class and says ‘thanks for a great lesson, Miss’ or the look on a pupil’s face when his bread comes out the oven, makes the hard work worthwhile. B Valerie I love teaching because it is never boring. I have been a teacher for over twenty years and I still enjoy my day to day work. I teach Science to students aged eleven to sixteen. This sometimes involves explaining difficult concepts and examining ethical questions which some students find very difficult. It is very stimulating working with young people and their enthusiasm and optimism can be quite infectious. To be a good teacher you need to be very knowledgeable about your subject. You must have a good sense of humour and be fair and consistent in your dealings with other people, but most of all you must be a good communicator. There are lots of teachers who know their subject very well but unless you can enthuse your students and build their confidence and self-esteem you will never be an inspirational teacher. D Joanna After studying languages at university, I was unsure what I wanted to do for a living. I worked for a year in a nursery school and, in my spare time, volunteered for a charity that sends people on projects in developing countries. I put together a programme of induction for the volunteers, to prepare them for going on their projects. I soon decided that I would like to do this as a full-time job, but I needed to get a qualification in education and some more experience. I took a postgraduate teacher training course and worked for three years teaching languages in a secondary school. During that time, I got very involved in global education - teaching school children about global issues and how they affect people in developing countries. After three years of teaching, I got a job managing a global education centre. I co-ordinated and contributed to a programme of workshops for children and training for teachers. A further three years later, the charity I had volunteered for could afford to give me a full-time job, and I’ve been working there for two years now."

Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Miss Johnson sat in the dining room having tea and looked out at all the people on the beach. Maybe she should go for a walk before dinner. She was just deciding in which direction she should walk when Mr Rodgers came into the room and walked straight towards her. There was no way she could avoid him; he had clearly seen her and she still had a cup of tea in front of her ready to drink. ‘Do you mind if I sit down?’ he asked politely. Of course she couldn't refuse; it wasn’t in her nature to be rude. ‘Yes, please do,’ she said and offered him some tea. He accepted but then didn’t seem to be paying attention when she asked him if he’d like milk and sugar. In fact he seemed very distracted. Suddenly he got up and started pacing up and down in front of the table. This was really quite annoying as he was walking right in front of the window and getting in the way of the nice view. ‘I’ve got a problem,’ he said, ‘and I was hoping you might be able to help me with it.’ ‘Oh!’ she replied. She hadn’t expected him to be so familiar; they had only known each other a few weeks and they were not really friends. ‘Well, I’ll try,’ she said. ‘I'd be happy to help in any way I can. ‘It all started last week,’ he began. ‘I was on my way to the shops when I bumped into Veronica Gray. We stopped and had a chat for a couple of minutes, you know about the weather, and then just as I was making my excuses and saying goodbye her husband came round the corner. He looked very serious and not at all happy to find us chatting together. Veronica suddenly went very quiet and almost ran away in the opposite direction. Her husband walked past me, barely said hello, and followed his wife round the corner. I was very confused by the whole thing. One minute she’d been happily gossiping and then as soon as Gregory appeared she became a different person. And he, well, for a second I thought he might hit me.’ I didn’t see either of them again until last night, here in the hotel. I was coming down to dinner when I heard voices on the stairs below me. I didn’t recognise who it was but as I walked round the corner I saw it was Veronica and Gregory and they were clearly arguing. It was too late for me turn back, they had already seen me, so I said good evening and carried on downstairs as quickly as I could. But Gregory called me back. He was quite angry and started shouting at me; he said I should mind my own business and leave his wife alone. Veronica was crying and tried to tell her husband to leave me alone, that it wasn’t my fault and so on. It was very unpleasant and I really had no idea what was going on. I said I had no idea what he was talking about and to be honest I might have just put it down to him being a bit jealous and left it at that except that at that moment Annabel came down the stairs and saw us. I don’t know if you know but she and I are engaged.’ ‘Yes, I did know; congratulations.’ And of course it didn’t look good, having Gregory more or less accuse me of having some sort of affair with his wife. Annabel just looked at me and walked off. Now she won’t speak to me. What do you think I should do? Should I confront Gregory and make him see sense? Or should I try and find out from Veronica what is going on? There’s obviously something not right between them; I just don’t understand how I got involved. I’d really appreciate any help you can give me.’ ‘Well, I think the first thing you need to do is speak to Annabel and make sure she sees that this is just a misunderstanding.’ ‘I’ve tried that,’ he explained, ‘but she won’t speak to me; she doesn’t answer the phone when I call her.’ He looked desperate. ‘OK,’ she said gently, ‘why don’t I go and speak to Annabel, and tell her about this conversation we’ve just had?’ ‘Would you? Oh, thank you, I’d be so grateful.’ She left him sitting at the table looking much happier already. And she knew just where to find Annabel. At this time of day she was always in the garden reading. 1 How did Miss Johnson react when she saw Mr Rodgers come into the dining room? A She was pleased to see him. B She avoided him.

    "text": "You are going to read an interview in which a woman talks about her experience of being on a reality TV show. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. What show did you go on and why? The TV show I went on involved holding a dinner party for 4 people I’d never met before. There were 5 of us and we held a dinner party in each of our houses on consecutive nights, so we had 5 dinner parties in one week. It was exhausting but a lot of fun. It’s a competition where you can actually win quite a lot of money and there is quite a competitive atmosphere. At the end of each evening you have to give a score for the evening and the person with the highest score at the end of the week wins. I didn’t win unfortunately but that wasn’t my only reason for going on it, although of course it would have been nice. I 9 I I watch it every week and I wanted to be on it myself just to see what it would be like to be on the other side of the camera. I thought it would be fun and I knew I could do it better or at least as well as most of the people I’d watched. I 10 I For me it was much more about the food and trying to impress with my cooking skills than just getting on TV. Was the experience what you expected? It was actually very different from what I had expected. I hadn’t realised what it would be like to have a camera crew with me while I was preparing everything and how much they wanted to see of my house. It felt strange but they were very nice and friendly and made me feel comfortable. In fact they really made me laugh while I was trying to cook and be all serious. I 11 I I knew they would be with me all the day I was hosting the meal but they wanted to see me every other day as well and ask me lots of questions on camera about the other people and what I thought of their food. The other people were the biggest surprise; I know seeing how we all get on and the different relationships that form is a big part of the show but I was still surprised by the other individuals who had been chosen to take part. I 12 I What shocked me was how critical everyone was. I’m quite a polite person and very optimistic so I always try and find the best of a situation. The first night was a bit of disaster as the host got really behind on the timing and we had to wait ages for the main course and then when it came out it wasn’t cooked properly. I tried to compliment her on the vegetables and the presentation and told her how wonderful the starter was but the others were just saying things like ‘I’m sorry, I really can’t eat this,’ and ‘Well, it’s OK, but it isn’t that great, is it?’ The poor woman was nearly in tears. Fortunately my evening went well and although I’m sure they had plenty of criticisms to make they did it behind my back rather than to my face so there was a much pleasanter atmosphere. What did it feel like when you watched the programme on TV? It was really strange to see myself on TV but it was fascinating seeing how they had edited everything and put it all together. I 13 I I watched it with a big group of friends and I kept wanting to tell them about all the bits that had been cut out. In a way the programme doesn’t give a realistic portrayal of what really happened as they tend to choose the most shocking and embarrassing parts to put in but I guess that’s what makes good television; it has to be entertaining. Would you say it was a positive experience? It was definitely good fun and yes I think it was positive. I 14 I I felt under an enormous amount of pressure the whole week knowing that the camera was watching my every move. The day I had to cook I felt very nervous and stressed, it’s bad enough entertaining but when you know you’re being filmed it’s a hundred times worse. But at the end of the evening I felt a great sense of achievement. Nothing awful happened and I think they liked my food and I was able to relax a bit more after my evening. I 15 I I always feel sorry for the people who have to go first because as well as doing all the cooking you have to worry about introducing everyone and you have no idea what to expect. Overall I came second so I didn’t win the money but felt that was quite respectable. I feel more confident cooking for other people now and I still watch the programme and enjoy it too! A They must have had about 6 or 7 hours of footage from each of the 5 days and yet all you see is about 25 minutes. B I'm glad I did it even though I didn’t love every minute of it. C Everyone else made really interesting dishes and we all got on really well. D There were a real mix of personalities and there was one person in particular I am very happy I’ll never have to see again. E I’m not really an exhibitionist so I would never go on a show like Big Brother but with this there was a point to it; it wasn’t just about people watching us do very ordinary everyday things. F I was also surprised by how much time they wanted to be with me. G I did it because I love cooking and entertaining and I’m a huge fan of the show. H I went second which was much better than going first as I had at least met all the other people before they arrived on my doorstep."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about four different well-known beaches. For questions 16-30 choose from the places (A-D). The beaches may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. According to the text which beach or beaches: are close to big cities? 16 | 17 | is just one of many attractive beaches in the area? 18 | was popular with the country’s royal family in the past? 19 | has hosted a lot of music events? 20 | has needed to have sand imported from other beaches? 21 | has won an award for natural beauty? 22 | is well connected by public transport? 23 | have held a world sports event? 24 | 25 | sometimes has marine animals passing through the area? 26 | attracts a lot of foreigners at Christmas? 27 | has been used in a lot of publicity material? 28 | have separate areas for swimming and surfing? 29 | 30 Famous Beaches Waikiki Beach, Hawaii Waikiki Beach is located on the southern side of the island of Honolulu. Its name comes from the Hawaiian language and means sprouting fresh water. The beach is very popular because of the warm climate, clear blue skies and beautiful views, as well as the good surf. On windy days the waves can be strong and the beach’s long rolling break makes it ideal for all types of surfing. Half of the beach is sectioned off for surfing with the other half left for swimming. The shore line now has a number of tall buildings and hotel resorts. The first hotels opened in the 1880s and from the 1890s the resort grew in popularity with tourists from the mainland, although the area had been a retreat for the Hawaiian royal family for many decades before that. The beach hosts many events each year including surfing competitions, outrigger canoe races, hula dancing, and in recent years free movies projected onto an enormous outdoor screen. Over time the beach has suffered from erosion and there have been a number of projects to try to protect the beach and replenish lost sand. At one time sand was shipped over from California although from the 1970s projects have focused on reducing further loss and sustaining the existing sand. Copacabana Beach, Brazil Copacabana beach gets its name from the area of Rio de Janeiro in which it is situated. The borough of Copacabana is to the south of the city and is world famous because of the beach. The beach is 4 kilometres long and has historic forts at either end. The beach has been the site for all sorts of outdoor events; it has hosted the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup many times and in recent years has been the venue for huge free concerts. It is also where millions of people go every year to celebrate on New Year’s Eve. When it was announced that Rio de Janeiro would be hosting the 2016 Olympics locals congregated on the beach to celebrate. There are many hotels, hostels, bars, nightclubs and restaurants along the promenade and the promenade is itself a work of art; a 4 kilometre-long pavement landscape of Portuguese design. Copacabana is well linked to the rest of the city; it has 3 metro stations and numerous bus services as well as 3 major roads. Bondi Beach, Australia Bondi beach is a well-known and popular beach; it is also the name of the suburb where it is situated to the east of Sydney. It is just 7 kilometres from the Sydney central business district. Its name comes from the Aboriginal word meaning water breaking over rocks. Bondi beach became increasingly popular during the middle of the nineteenth century and was declared a public beach in 1882. It remains popular with locals and visitors and is particularly popular with British and Irish tourists on Christmas day. The beach is about one kilometre long. Areas safe for swimming are shown by red and yellow flags and the southern end is generally reserved for surfing. In addition to the underwater currents a further danger comes from the sun. Despite official warnings about the need to use sun protection in Australia there are no sun umbrellas on Bondi beach. Sharks, however, do not present much of a risk as the beach is protected by an underwater shark net during the summer. During their months of migration it is possible to see whales and dolphins in the area and very occasionally penguins. The beach regularly hosts many public events including a short film festival and a sculpture exhibition. During the 2000 Sydney Olympics the beach was the site for the beach volleyball competition. Praia da Marinha, Portugal Praia de Marinha, beach of the Navy in English, is one of the more well-known of many spectacular beaches in the Algarve, the southern coastal area of Portugal. It’s famous for its stunning cliffs and clear clean water. It has been used in many advertising campaigns and in promotional material for Portugal. In 1998 the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment awarded it the Golden Beach award for its outstanding natural qualities. There are many other beautiful beaches along the same stretch of coast; the south facing coastline of the Algarve is over 150 kilometres long. The Algarve has been popular with tourists for many decades, particularly those from Northern Europe. In addition to well-known natural beauty spots, nice beaches and a warm mild climate, tourists are attracted by the growing number of high quality golf courses. Tourism is now the most important economic activity in the area."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a successful novelist. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (А, В, С or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Darren Bell is a well-known household name and has had three best-sellers. I met him to find out what his secret was. He writes in such a natural, easy-going style I wasn't surprised when he told me he had been writing stories from a very young age. I’ve always enjoyed writing; I used to write short stories when I was at school and really enjoyed the opportunity to be creative and let my imagination run wild. When I asked how his family and friends reacted to his creative writing he explained that it was largely thanks to their positive feedback that he had pursued a career as a writer. He said his teachers and parents always encouraged him to write and to enter competitions; he won his first writing competition at school when he was just 7 years old, My story was printed in the local newspaper, it was really exciting and my Mum still has a copy of the paper somewhere. Did you ever feel very different from your school friends? I asked him. Not at all, he said. We did all the normal things like watch football together, go out on our bikes and so on. The only difference was that I would be more likely to have a notebook in my bag and might sometimes write ideas down, but my friends were used to that, it didn’t feel strange and no-one ever said anything about it. I asked how his passion for writing developed as he got older and how he found his particular fictional style. He explained that when he went to university he got involved in writing for the university newspaper. He told me he wrote all sorts of different articles but at the end of the day after trying all sorts of different writing types he decided he preferred writing fiction rather than serious articles about news events. As it is now, it was always the sense of getting completely lost in my own world that attracted me. I like being creative and I feel more comfortable expressing my own ideas and images rather than writing about things that are real. He explained this further by saying that when you write about true facts you have to justify everything and get things right but when he was writing his own stories he felt like he could write about anything he liked. That’s not to say you don't have to do a lot of research, he pointed out. He told me he had spent hours in libraries and museums looking up all sorts of things from chemical equations to dinosaurs and that the best source of information was talking to experts and people who had really experienced the sorts of things he wanted the characters in his books to experience. He says it’s important to make the events and characters seem believable otherwise people won’t connect with the story. I always make an effort to research my subject matter properly as there will always be someone out there who really does know about whatever I’m talking about and I don’t want anybody to read my books and think I'm talking nonsense. I asked him where he got his inspiration from for his unusual storylines and he openly admitted that it was very boring everyday events. When I write I start by thinking of a real situation and real people and then imagine what they might do if something unexpected or unusual happened. I like to write about how different people react and how this affects their relationships with one another. He added that one thing that he always tried to ensure was that his stories had a clear and satisfying ending. I don’t like to leave any loose ends, he said. I myself find it frustrating if at the end of a book something is not explained, so I try and avoid this frustration for my readers. He also says he tries to give his novels happy endings. That’s not to say sad things don’t happen in my novels because they do and any story where everyone is happy and only good things happen would be very unrealistic, but I don’t want readers to finish my novels feeling depressed, so I like to finish on a positive note. And finally what is his key to success? According to Darren the most important thing is to have a great team of friends and family behind you to help you and support you. I am lucky to have a very supportive and understanding family and numerous friends, who have been fantastic and helped by reading endless drafts of my work and giving very honest comments on it. I couldn’t have done any of it without them. 1 Why was the interviewer not surprised that Darren had been writing since a young age? A Because he writes like a trained professional. B Because he has a very relaxed way of writing. C Because he is well-known for the stories he wrote as a child. D Because his stories are very creative. 2 How did he feel when he won his first writing competition? A embarrassed B different from his friends C excited D he was too young to feel anything 3 When he says ‘my friends were used to that’ in line 13, what does ‘that’ refer to? A watching football and going for bike rides together B Darren winning competitions C carrying notebooks in their bags D Darren writing things down in his notebook 4 Why does he say he prefers writing creative fiction to writing about real news events? A He has never written about real life events. B He finds real life events boring. C He likes to make things up. D Writing fiction means he doesn’t have to do research. 5 Why does he think it is important that the people and events in his books are believable?

    "text": "You are going to read an article in which a young man who lives in London explains why cycling is by the far the best way to get around in a big city. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Why I cycle in the city I cycle because it is cheaper, quicker, more reliable, it is better for the environment and it is better for me; both mentally and physically. Public transport is so expensive and so unreliable these days I try to use it as little as possible. On the underground and trains there are always delays, planned and unplanned closures and you can wait half an hour for a bus to then sit in a traffic jam. I 9 I Public transport can be so uncomfortable too; it gets so crowded in the rush hour with hundreds of people all crammed into a tiny space. This makes it a stressful and unpleasant beginning or end to everyone’s day. No one looks at anyone else, even though you are only centimetres away from each other and all social graces go out the window. I much prefer to be on my bike. I know how long it will take me to get where I am going and I am outside in the fresh air. I 10 I The one thing I used to like about travelling by train was reading the free paper or a good book but sometimes it is so busy you don’t have enough space to do that. It is true that at less busy times of the day public transport isn’t such a bad way to get around, except that at times of the day when fewer people want to use trains and buses there are, logically, fewer of them. In my experience an off-peak journey might be cheaper and pleasanter in the sense that you can sit down, read a book and generally not have your personal space invaded, but your journey will take longer as you’ll have to wait longer for connections. The other alternative would be to travel by car but again there are all sorts of reasons why the bike is a hundred times better. I 11 I Firstly, travelling by car is extremely expensive, something which in the future will only get worse as fuel prices continue to rise and parking restrictions increase. And while you don’t have to deal with impatient and stressed passengers pushing you off trains or buses you have to suffer impatient and stressed drivers next to you and behind you in heavy traffic. I 12 I If there are hold ups because of traffic problems or an accident, we cyclists can just keep on going while cars have to sit and wait; how often do you hear someone apologising for being late because they were ‘stuck in traffic’? Often. A further disadvantage is the difficulty of parking; there is never a free parking space at the end of the day in the street so unless you want to drive around for hours looking for a space the only option is to have a garage; an additional cost. In the city centre the few public car parks which exist are unbelievably expensive. I can leave my bike more or less anywhere and don’t have to pay a penny. I 13 I Finally and by no means the least important problem with travelling by car is that it is extremely harmful to the environment. If more people left their cars at home or car-shared we could reduce our carbon emissions significantly. There are of course also some drawbacks to cycling. I 14 I There is no denying it really is unpleasant cycling in the rain. However, it is also not nice to be on the bus or train or driving a car in the rain. Safety of course is an issue too, although in recent years a lot more cycle lanes have been put in place and I think drivers are more aware of cyclists now than they used to be. Another thing is that when you cycle you have to carry a change of clothes with you which can be inconvenient but I have got used to it and now I actually like arriving at work and changing into clean, dry things. I 15 I At the end of a long busy day it sometimes just seems too much energy to get on my bike and cycle for forty minutes but once I get going I always feel much better for the physical exercise. For me there is no contest, cycling is simply the best way to get around. Walking is the only other way I would contemplate getting around in the city, but of course that is really only possible for short distances. A Cycling at quiet times of the day means you can get where you want to be in even less time. B Even on a good day my journey by underground, train or bus would take me longer than cycling and my bike takes me all the way to where I want to go. C The bad weather is probably the worst. D The only other negative point is that it can be tiring. E Also cyclists are, on the whole, nice to each other unlike fellow commuters on the train or bus. F A journey by car to work in the morning can be a very exhausting experience. G When I get home I can literally just pick it up and bring it inside with me. H Of course in a car you have your own space and don’t have the same pressures as on public transport but there are other problems to deal with."

I love being indoors and hearing the rain outside and watching it through the window. I even enjoy walking in the rain, but there was one time when I very nearly got swept away by the rain. It was what is called a flash flood. It had been raining hard all day and I was on my way home from work on my bike. There’s a river near my house and it had been in danger of flooding for a number of days. Sandbags had been put in place to build up a protective barrier and prevent it from breaking its banks, however, it wasn’t enough. The water level reached a point where it simply overflowed and in a matter of seconds the country lane I was cycling along became a small river of fast-running water. I was dragged off my bike by the water and pulled about 10 metres down the road. I managed to grab onto the branch of a tree and get myself out of the water. My bike was not so lucky and it disappeared from sight. B Jada in St Lucia I don’t like the wind: it reminds me of when I was in a hurricane on holiday one year. I was only young and on holiday with my parents and it was the middle of summer. We'd been on the beach all day in glorious sunshine when suddenly the sky began to get very dark. Lots of people started leaving the beach and told us we should do the same. No one seemed to be panicking but there was definitely a sense of urgency. When we got back to the hotel they told us it would be better to stay downstairs in the lounge room and that if we had to go to our rooms we should not go anywhere near the balcony and keep all the doors and windows shut. So we stayed in the hotel restaurant and listened to the wind and the rain outside. We couldn’t see anything because all the shutters were closed. The most frightening thing was looking outside in the morning after the storm had passed. The hotel garden was devastated; two small trees had been knocked down and many others had branches broken off. It was terrible. C Lauren in Sydney The strangest thing I’ve ever seen is a dust storm. I woke up and looked outside and everything was red. It was really weird; there was an eerie orange fog, just like something out of a science fiction film about an alien invasion or something. I was quite scared being on my own and turned the TV on to find out what was going on and that’s when I found it was a dust storm and not the end of the world. I felt calmer after that. Apparently it was caused by a combination of very dry weather and strong winds. They were recommending people stay inside as there had been reports of people suffering breathing problems but I had to go to work so I just wrapped a scarf around my face and went out in it. It didn’t last long and started to clear by the middle of the afternoon but it caused a lot of disruption; they had to cancel lots of flights and ferries. D Daniel in Tunisia The weather I really like is when it’s warm and sunny; a perfect summers’ day. Sitting in the garden in the sunshine makes me very happy. However, the sun in the Sahara Desert is a whole different matter. I was on holiday with friends in Tunisia and as part of our tour we were taken on a camel ride through the desert. I don’t think it was a terribly well organised tour as we ended up in the desert at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, almost the hottest time of the day. We were given plenty of protective clothing and we were only in the desert for about 40 minutes but even then you get quite a good sense of just how hot and barren it can be in the desert. The dunes look endless and there is absolutely nothing in sight except sand and sky and the heat is very intense: there is no escape from it. E Ryan in New York I love the winter, blue skies and really cold temperatures and snow. I love going for walks in the cold weather but one year on holiday in New York I had quite a frightening experience in the snow. My girlfriend and I were on holiday and when it started snowing we thought it was wonderful. We were quite a long way from our hotel and being young and naive we thought it would be fun to walk in the snow. We weren’t very well-dressed for the weather and had completely under-estimated how much it was going to snow. Within about ten minutes we could no longer see where we were going and it was impossible to tell where the road was. It was dangerous. It was a proper blizzard and very disorientating. All we could see was white. We got back to the hotel eventually but if I found myself in a situation like that again I think I would be much more sensible: I’d stay in the warm until the snow had passed."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a keen and well-respected gardener. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (А, В, С or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. When did you first become interested in gardening? I started gardening at the age of 5; my mother gave each of us, my older sister and brother and me, a section of the garden which was ours to look after. I used to save my pocket money to buy seeds and bulbs and things to plant in my little patch and was really excited to watch the things I planted begin to grow. My brother and sister were never very interested and my mother used to do what needed to be done in the garden to keep it looking nice but it was really only me who had a real passion for gardening. I was quite unique in my family in that respect. I used to go out to the woods and countryside near where I lived and collect wild flowers when I was a child. Then when I got home I would look up in books the names of the flowers I had found and press them and keep. On a good day I would find about twenty new flowers. At school I chose to study science and botany right up to the age of 18 and learnt a lot about plants. And what do you like about gardening now? I love being outside in the fresh air and seeing things develop and grow. I like planning in the autumn for the next year and imagining how it will look in the spring and summer. You never really know how it will turn out in the end and when it works out well it is very satisfying. In that way gardening can be very rewarding. It can also be very challenging. You need to learn about different soil types and which plants grow best in which places. It is also important to know how big plants will grow and how quickly. And you have to consider which plants will go together with others. You have to be very patient to be a good gardener as you always have to wait a long time to see the results of your ideas and hard work. You usually have to wait months to see if something works or not. But in the summer there is nothing I like more than being outside in my garden with the beautiful flowers and their lovely smells and scents. Are there any negative points? It can be very physically demanding and there are times when the weather means you can’t get outside and do things, which can be very frustrating. The winter months are obviously more difficult than other times of the year as there is still work to be done but not so much to enjoy, and working outside in winter is not as pleasant as at other times of the year. Have you ever grown fruit and vegetables? Yes, I have grown quite a lot of fruit and vegetables in the past. My husband and I love cooking and it is great to cook with home grown fruit and vegetables. More than anything else we use all our own herbs from the garden when we’re cooking. It’s wonderful to be able to go out and pick things like parsley, mint, coriander or rosemary from the garden for dishes we’re making; it is the ultimate in fresh ingredients. For that reason I have always had a herb garden. Most herbs have flowers so they look pretty in the garden and they smell nice too. They are also quite easy to grow and don’t take up much space so you can grow them even if you have a small garden. Have you ever won any prizes for your plants or flowers? We live in a small village in the countryside and each year there is a flower show which I have taken part in. I’ve won a couple of times but I am not that interested in competitions. I don’t think growing plants and flowers should be competitive. I enter the flower show each year because I want to support the village, and the spring flower show is a long established tradition which I think it is important to maintain. What advice would you give someone who wants to start gardening? Don’t be too ambitious. I would say you should start with well-known plants that are easy to grow, and have a look at what grows in other gardens near you to get an idea of what sorts of plants suit the area you are in. The main thing is not to be impatient. You need to realise that it takes a long time to see the fulfilment of your work. 1 Why does she say she was quite unique in her family?

    "text": "You are going to read an article about learning a second language. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. How to be a better second language learner There is a lot of evidence which suggests that it is better to learn a second language when you are still young, ideally before the age of 11, and that once you are a teenager it is more difficult to learn a foreign language. This might be true but there are plenty of examples of adults who have started to learn a second language later in life and still managed to achieve a very good level. There are lots of factors involved in how well people are able to learn and use a second (or third or fourth) language and age is only one of them. I 9 I Here are some tips which might help you: Firstly you are likely to learn a language more quickly the more exposure you have to it. It therefore makes sense to try to spend time in a country where the language is spoken. You do not necessarily have to go and live in the country long term but try to make frequent visits so that you often have to use the language for genuine communication and see and hear the language all around you. It is important that even if your visits are short they are frequent so that you do not forget everything you have learnt in between one trip and the next. I 10 I If you go with friends who speak your language it is unlikely you will have much need to use the language you are trying to learn. Probably the best thing to do is to go alone and enrol on a language course so that you will have some instruction and help with the language from a teacher and you will also meet other people in a similar situation to yourself. Of course this might not be possible, it might be too far away or too expensive. Don’t worry, even if you stay in your own country and learn another language there are still things you can do to make the experience more effective. It is possible to try to teach yourself; you can buy some books, borrow material from a library or follow an online course but the best thing to do is sign up to have language classes with a qualified teacher. It is more fun to attend classes with other people and you can often help each other and learn things from other students so you are likely to make more rapid progress than if you try to study on your own. I 11 I In addition, you want a teacher who will give you homework and correct it for you and guide you in what other things you can be doing outside of class by yourself. One thing you should definitely try to do is read in the language you are studying as reading is the best way to increase your vocabulary. I 12 I When you are reading you will probably come across language you are already familiar with in new and different contexts. This helps to broaden your knowledge. For example, you might see verbs you already know in different forms. It doesn’t matter what you read, and the best advice is to read something that you would read in your own language. Reading in a foreign language can be difficult, so it is important that you choose something you are interested in and would enjoy in your own language. You can even read a book you have already read in your own language. When you come across new words or expressions try to guess their meaning rather than looking them up in a dictionary. It is not usually necessary to understand every single word. I 13 I That way you won’t interrupt the flow of your reading. When you come to recording new words or expressions either in class or from reading it is really important to write whole sentences and use meaningful examples. I 14 I A big problem when you try to use the language you are learning is inaccurate translation. You shouldn’t try to construct sentences and phrases the same way you do in your first language as this often results in something that sounds strange or even something that makes no sense at all. The best way to avoid this is to learn whole expressions and sentences and not to focus too much on individual words. If possible, you should try to listen to the language too. You can do this by listening to the radio or watching TV. I 15 I Short episodes of television series are better than films as films can be very long and the language is often very colloquial and informal. And finally, ideally you should practice speaking and communicating in the language with someone who knows the language better than you. This doesn’t need to be a native speaker but should be someone who can correct you and help you with things you don’t know. A And you need a teacher to explain things to you and more importantly to correct you if you make any mistakes. В Like with reading try to choose things you are interested in already and would listen to or watch in your own language. С Another point to consider is how you spend your time while you are there. D This means you are more likely to want to finish it and keep going when it gets difficult. E Try to write things which are real and true for you as this will make it easier to remember. F It is also a good way of reinforcing the grammatical structures you already know. G So the good news is that if you are learning a language as a teenager or adult there is no reason why you should not reach a good level if you really want to. H If you really want to check the meaning of something underline it and come back to it later"

    "text": "In today’s world protecting the environment and sustainability are very important issues. Cities and councils throughout the world are working hard to improve the current situation and sustainability will be an important factor in all town and city development in the future. One city which has always had the environment as its top priority is the Brazilian city of Curtiba. It is in the south of the country and is one of the most innovative cities in the world. It is so environmentally-friendly it is known as the ecological capital of Brazil. It is such a successful example of sustainable development that it is visited by delegates from all over the world. The people in Curtiba are very proud of their city and not only believe in a greener lifestyle but they really live it. Sustainable development is evident in all aspects of city life. Residents have planted 1.6 million trees and over 70% of all waste is recycled. Curtiba has the highest rate of paper and glass recycling of anywhere in Brazil. Paper recycling in Curtiba saves over 1,000 trees a year. Like many cities in the world Curtiba also faces many socio-economic problems but because it is such a unique and forward thinking city the residents came up with a revolutionary idea to help poor families and reduce waste at the same time. Each family sorts its rubbish and then it is weighed and ‘sold’ back to the city council in exchange for fruit and meat. This provides healthy food for those who can’t afford it and also encourages recycling and helps keep the city clean and tidy. Rubbish which cannot be recycled is burnt to make electricity. The city’s public transport is also one of the greenest in the world. The bus service is cheap and efficient and saves millions of car journeys each year as you can use the buses to get anywhere in the city. There are over 70 kilometres of bus only routes through the city. Roads have 4 lanes, 2 for cars and lorries and 2 for buses only. This means buses can run freely through the city without getting stuck in traffic jams. As a result millions of people use the bus every day rather than their cars. There are also special bus lines for students, the disabled and tourists. The best thing, though, is that the 1,200 buses which make up the network run on biodiesel; that is fuel made from plants like soya. Reduced car traffic and low consumption of traditional fuels means that Curtiba is one of the least polluted cities in Brazil. Curtiba was one of the first cities in the world to have completely car free areas in the city centre. Also their bus stops have been carefully designed so that they are level with the buses. They are tube shaped and have ramps to provide easy access for everyone. Curtiba has grown dramatically over the years. In 1950 300,000 people lived there, now the population is 1.8 million. However, even from the beginning the needs of the city had to be balanced with the needs of the environment. Fortunately this has had great economic benefits for the economy. Income per capita is 60% higher than the national average. The architect who led the city’s growth in the 1960s was so popular he later became the city’s mayor. One big challenge that the city has faced throughout its development is flooding. The city has had to find ways to protect itself from flooding which has affected the city centre for many years. Curtiba wanted to find a solution which worked with nature. The solution they came up with involved creating a number of lakes in the city’s parks which could hold flood water. Also no buildings were allowed to be built in areas which had a risk of flooding. One of the most beautiful buildings in the city is the university. It is called the free university of environment and was built using reclaimed eucalyptus poles. You can study a wide range of subjects there although of course it offers many different environmental courses, including bio-architecture. 1 Why is Curtiba known as the ecological capital of Brazil? A It is a very modern and new city. B It has a lot of green spaces. C The people there do a lot to protect and conserve the environment. D It is visited by lots of foreigners interested in the environment. 2 What does the author mean in line 13 when it says the residents ‘came up with a revolutionary idea’? A Their idea made a lot of people angry. B Their idea was original and different. C Their idea caused a lot of political change. D Their idea made a lot of money for the city. 3 Which of the following does not happen in Curtiba? A Families separate their household waste. B Residents are given food as a reward for recycling their rubbish. C Residents help to keep the city clean and tidy. D Recycled waste is used to produce electricity. 4 Why don’t many people in Curtiba use cars? A Because the public transport system is so efficient. B Because there are too many traffic jams. C Because many roads in the city are for buses only. D Because fuel is very expensive. 5 Why does Curtiba have less pollution than other cities? A It is smaller than other cities. B Cars use fuel which doesn’t cause pollution. C People don’t use cars much and buses use fuel which doesn’t cause much pollution. D There are only 1,200 buses in the city. 6 In line 31 what does ‘this’ refer to? A the large population of the city. B the fact that all growth was balanced with consideration for the environment. C the growth in population from 1950. D the average income for each person in the city. 7 How did the city solve the problem of flooding? A by building fewer buildings. B by making sure there were lots of lakes. C by creating more parks. D They didn’t do anything but hoped nature would solve the problem itself. 8 What is special about the city’s university? A You can only study environmental courses there. B It is the only university where you can study bio-architecture. C It is a very attractive building. D You don’t have to pay to study there."

    "text": "How many times do you hear people say they don’t have time to do something? All the time! ‘I meant to do that but I didn’t have time!’ is something we say or think far too often; it is the number one excuse for not doing something we should have done. 9 .......... This is a relationship which has also changed a lot through history. Think about all the machines and time-saving gadgets that are now a part of our everyday life that people living 100 or even 50 years ago had to do without; washing machines, vacuum cleaners, microwaves and dishwashers are just a few. We have mobile phones now so that we can contact each other at any time no matter where we are. the Internet gives us access to just about any information we could possibly want as well as providing instant communication with other people anywhere in the world, 10 .......... The idea of using time efficiently has become increasingly important in the Western world. People in wealthy developed countries are often expected to do several jobs at once. At a time when unemployment is high and international competition is strong there is a lot of pressure on companies and individual workers to be as efficient as possible and to get as much work done as possible in the limited time available. 11 .......... This concept of time pressure has also been passed on to the less developed countries where many of the goods for developing countries are made. In places like India and Mexico people often have to work very long shifts, sometimes as much as 12 to 16 hours a day, or even for 48 hours without a break. Goods have to be produced to meet demand in the developed world and this demand puts a lot of pressure on workers. Time is increasingly becoming a commodity like any other. 12 .......... Do you use the self-service check out in the supermarket? Have you bought furniture and then assembled it yourself at home? Have you spent time setting up a new computer? If you have then you have been working for free. It is possible to buy and sell time these days. For example, you can pay someone else to do your shopping for you or walk your dog for you if you don’t have time, but it won’t be cheap. A positive reflection of how our relationship with time is changing is that in some cities there are things called time banks where you can exchange time with other busy people. 13 .......... You will then be paid back in time when you need it. No money changes hands but everyone has to pay into the bank in time. The biggest challenge we face in our personal lives is how not to waste time and make the most of the time we have. According to recent research 20% of people regularly cancel social arrangements because of a lack of time and men do this more often than women. However, cancelling social arrangements can have a serious negative impact because it reduces our quality of life; it can stop us doing what we want, which can lead to unhappiness. 14 .......... This doesn’t have to be something active or sociable; it might be finding time to read a good book. By making sure we don’t miss out on the things we enjoy and value we are likely to be happier and more satisfied with life in general. The key to making the most of our time, both at work and in our personal lives, is prioritising. It is important to recognise which things need to be done immediately and which can wait until later. 15 .......... You might think that revising for an exam or doing homework at the last minute is a good way of saving time but the results will not be as good. Finally, psychologists say that people who are always on time tend to be organised and have everything under control. Those who are usually early are likely to be anxious and in need of being in control all the time. People who are often late are probably just disorganised, although it might be that they are consciously or unconsciously rebelling against our time obsessed society. A In spite of these new inventions we still run out of time. B If you have some free time you can volunteer to do something for someone else like wait for a delivery or water their plants while they are on holiday. C As a result working hours have increased by 25% in the USA and in Japan workers sometimes sleep in the office. D Time is money and nowadays many companies try to save time and money by making their customers work for free. E Time is a very precious commodity and humans have always had a very close relationship with it. F If you try to do too many things at once you are more likely to make mistakes and waste time going back to correct them. G This doesn’t mean we should put off things which are boring or difficult just because we don’t want to do them. H It is important to find time for ourselves to do the things which matter most to us."

    "text": " You are going to read an article in which four people talk about cheating in exams. For questions 16-30 choose from the people (A-D). The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: was caught cheating in an exam? 16 | didn’t let a friend copy their work? 17 | probably got better marks as a result of cheating? 18 | 19 | regrets trying to cheat in an exam? 20 | cheated more than once? 21 | 22 | didn’t get caught because a friend helped them? 23 | tried to cheat by writing notes on a part of their body? 24 | cheated by asking a friend to tell them the answers? 25 | only tried to cheat in the subject they weren’t good at? 26 | decided not to cheat again after a bad experience? 27 | 28 | thinks it is always wrong to cheat? 29 | thinks there is nothing wrong with cheating? 30 | Cheating in exams A My friend and I had the same surname so we always ended up sitting next to each other, or one behind the other, in exams at school. We worked out this system where we would pass a piece of paper to each other with the answers to the questions. Sometimes we just passed it by hand if we were sitting close enough and other times we’d throw it on the floor for the other person to pick up. It was quite a good system and I think over lots of exams we probably helped each other equally so it was fair and I’m sure we both got higher marks. Unfortunately a teacher did see us doing it once. I was just leaning down to pick up a paper my friend was passing back to me when a teacher appeared out of nowhere and picked it up first. There was no way we could deny what we were doing, it was so obvious. The teacher didn’t say anything until the end of the exam and then when she collected our papers she wrote a big zero at the top. We didn’t do it anymore after that, it had been good before but we decided it wasn’t worth the risk. B This happened when I was about 14 years old. The last exam of the year was history, which had always been my worst subject. I was useless at remembering dates and people’s names so I decided to write the dates and names of the important events we’d studied on the inside of my arm and then wore a jumper to cover it up so no-one could see. Unfortunately though, it was a really hot day. I really wanted to take my jumper off but I couldn’t. I realised after about ten minutes that there was no way I would be able to look at what I’d written without the teacher seeing and I just wished I hadn’t done it. I felt so hot and uncomfortable and was really worried about the teacher seeing and catching me that I didn’t do very well in the test at all. I was too distracted. I think I probably would have got a better result if I hadn’t tried to cheat. I learnt a good lesson though. I never tried to cheat again after that. C I used to always cheat in my maths exams when I was at school. We were allowed to take a calculator with us into the exam and I used to write all the important formulae that we were supposed to remember on the inside of the calculator case. I did it lots of times. I don’t regret it at all. I was quite good at maths anyway but I’m sure I got better results as a result of cheating. In other exams like chemistry and physics, I sometimes wrote notes on bits of tissue then pretended I needed to blow my nose and looked at my notes during the exam. It worked really well. There was only one time I was almost caught; I dropped the tissue on the floor by accident just as a teacher was walking past. He was about to pick it up when my friend, who had also seen what had happened, deliberately knocked over his water bottle. The teacher was so busy clearing up the water I think he forgot about me. If you’re clever enough to work out a way to cheat and not get caught then I think you deserve to get good marks. It’s like that in the real world; if you can do something more easily and with less hard work then you will. Why not? D I’ve never cheated in an exam and really don’t see the point. I mean sooner or later people will find out if you know something or not. If you cheat to get better results then you’re lying to yourself as well as to everyone else. Rather than spending your time thinking of really clever and original ways to cheat without anyone realising, you should just spend that time studying. I’m sure it will help you a lot more in the long run. A friend once tried to read my answers in an exam while pretending to pick something up off the floor. As soon as I realised I covered my work so he couldn’t see. He was quite annoyed with me afterwards but I didn’t think it was fair that he should do well because of my hard work."

Even though Nick knew he hadn’t forgotten anything he had to check and double check he had his passport, tickets and wallet in his bag before he left the house. He had flown plenty of times before so this wasn’t the first time but he still felt nervous. But then this was no ordinary trip; this time he wasn’t just travelling abroad for a few weeks; he was about to start a whole new life on the other side of the world. He had spent months planning for it and couldn’t believe the day had finally arrived when he was heading for the airport about to get on a plane to India. He had never been there before but felt prepared as he had read so much about the place and watched various documentaries. They had also told him a lot about what to expect on the training course he had been on for his new job. There was no denying though that it was going to be very different from the life he was used to. His brother had offered to drive him to the airport, which he was very grateful for. His brother arrived exactly on time, as always, and together they carried his bags down to the car. It felt strange locking the door behind him, not knowing when he would see the place again. A friend of his was going to move in and rent it from him while he was away so he didn’t have to worry about it being empty. But it still made him sad to lock the door and leave. In the car driving to the airport his brother’s son kept them entertained talking about a party he had been to the day before and explaining in great detail what he could now do on his new bike. It was perfect; Nick didn’t want to think too much about where he was going and it was much better to be distracted by his six-year-old nephew. They arrived at the airport and Nick’s brother and nephew came in with him to check in his bags. Then they walked together to the security check. Nick had been dreading this moment, he had said goodbye to so many people recently and even cried at the end of his leaving party but this was the final goodbye; from this moment he was on his own. His nephew suddenly wanted a drink and so they said a quick goodbye and before they could get too emotional his nephew had dragged his brother away to the shop and he was standing on his own. He got ready to go through security, took off his jacket, took his laptop out of his bag and took his mobile and keys out of his pocket. This was it, he was really leaving. He walked around the shops for a while and bought some newspapers and books. He had been told his new colleagues would be grateful for these. He wasn’t planning to read them himself, his only plan for the flight was to sleep and maybe watch a film if they were showing something good. He walked to the gate and in no time at all he was sitting on the plane listening to the safety announcements. As the plane taxied down the runway he thought about how he had ended up where he was. It hadn’t been simple fate or destiny; he had gone looking for this opportunity. No-one had asked him to do it. He had made the effort to find this job; he had applied for it and out of over 20 candidates they had decided to give it to him. In a way he had fought for this seat on the plane and he had won. He deserved to be here and he was excited. He was going to miss all his friends and family but what he was going to do was amazing. It was the job he had always dreamed of; it was what he had spent years studying for. It wasn’t going to be easy but he felt very ready for the challenge. He felt with absolute certainty that he had made the right decision. He smiled to himself and as the plane left the ground he looked out of the window and said a silent goodbye to all the people he was leaving behind. 1 Why did he feel nervous before he left the house? A He had never flown on his own before. B He thought he had forgotten something. C He was about to go on holiday with someone he didn’t know. D He was about to make a big change in his life. 2 How much did he know about the place he was going to? A nothing B a lot; he had been there before C quite a lot; he had tried to learn about it D hardly anything; only what friends had told him. 3 Why did he feel strange locking the door? A He didn’t want his friend to live there. B He was going to miss all the things he had left behind. C He was worried about it being empty. D He was unsure when he would come back. 4 How did he feel about his nephew being in the car to the airport? A pleased B annoyed C amused D disappointed. 5 What happened when they said goodbye at the airport? A Nick’s nephew cried and ran away. B Nick cried. C Nick’s brother cried. D No-one cried. 6 Why did he buy newspapers and magazines at the airport? A He had forgotten to buy them before. B Other people had asked him to buy them. C He wanted something to read on the plane. D He knew the people he was going to be working with would like them. 7 Why does he say in line 32 ‘It hadn't been simple fate or destiny’? A He had worked hard to get this new job. B Getting the job had been a very long and complicated process. C He had been very unlucky to get this job. D He got the job because he had done what other people told him to do. 8 Which best describes how Nick was feeling as the plane took off? A worried B calm C sad D tired."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a couple who own a holiday home in the French Pyrenees. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Why did you decide to buy a holiday home here? We have always loved travelling and spending time in different countries on holidays. It made sense to us to have somewhere which was our own, where we could go back to again and again whenever we liked. (9) .......... It has everything we were looking for: mountains, beautiful scenery, good countryside for walking and there are towns and a major city nearby. We looked at some very remote places but decided we wanted to be in a town. We enjoy being able to walk down to the shops in the morning to get fresh bread and walk to a restaurant for dinner in the evening. It was important to us that it was easy to get to for short holidays too so the fact that there is an airport nearby was a key factor. (10) .......... How did you find this particular property? We did some research into the area we liked and we looked at adverts on the Internet, which gave us an idea of what was available. Then we went to an agency which specialised in property in the area where we were looking. They were really helpful and in three days they took us to a number of different houses as well as some empty plots of land with potential for building a new property. (11) .......... We spent time talking to the couple who were selling it and looking around the garden as well as the house. It’s not a big house; there are only two bedrooms, but it is exactly what we were looking for. It has a fantastic terrace with views of the mountains and because it is high up we can see right over the town too. It’s very picturesque. It has a wonderful big fireplace too so is nice and warm in winter. In fact it is a beautiful place to have a holiday at any time of the year. What do you like most about owning a second home? (12) .......... We spend lots of holidays here ourselves and sometimes friends and family join us, but we also let friends and family stay in it by themselves if they want to. It means the house is occupied more, and the more it is used the better. It would be a shame if it were empty a lot of the time. We also like that we have met some good friends here. (13) .......... Have you ever had any problems with the house? Fortunately no, nothing serious but it is always a worry when it is empty for long periods of time and we are so far away. We are lucky to have helpful neighbours and friends who live nearby who can keep an eye on the house for us. In the very cold weather last winter the pipe to the outside tap froze and split but the postman noticed and sealed it for us. We had a problem with the hot water tank once too. We arrived one time and turned it on and suddenly water started pouring down the stairs. (14) .......... We were able to get a plumber to come and look at it and then arranged for a new one to be fitted so it wasn’t too bad. One advantage of not always being here is that we have been able to have both the bathrooms redecorated. Some friends of ours did all the work for us and it worked out really well. Would you like to move and live here permanently? No. We have too much that we would miss back home: good friends and family. (15) .......... We might come for a month or more at a time instead of a week or two as we do now. But we bought it as a holiday home or second home not somewhere to live all the time. We like having both our homes and don’t want to give up either of them. We are very lucky that we can enjoy spending time in two lovely houses. A We visited this area a couple of times and we really liked it. B That wasn’t a very good start to our holiday but it is lucky it happened to us and not friends of ours. C Next year we will both retire and then we will be able to spend much more time here. D And finally we were looking for somewhere in contrast to where we live the rest of the year. E The house we now own was actually the last one we saw and we instantly knew it was perfect. F The weather is usually better than what we’re used to at home with lots of blue sky and sunshine, even in winter. G It is so nice each time we come out to have a group of people to spend time with and social events to go to. H We love that we can share it with our friends and family."

The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.

I 29 I I 30 I Memorable train journeys A London to Brighton (UK) I spent over ten years doing this journey every day of the week. I’m very relieved I am retired now. I still do the same journey sometimes but now I don’t have to travel in the rush hour and if there are delays it doesn’t matter so much. The journey when it went well wasn’t bad at all. It wasn’t too long and I was usually able to sit down and read the newspaper. It was quite pleasant as long as there were no annoying people having loud phone conversations. But generally it was fine and not a bad way to begin and end a busy day in the city. The problems and stress came with the all too frequent delays and cancellations. It was extremely frustrating, especially as I was paying so much money for my ticket. The cost was much too high in my opinion. I am glad I don’t have to pay that anymore. B Moscow to St Petersburg (Russia) The most memorable train journey I have ever been on was between Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia. We were about 17 years old and on a school trip to see the places we were studying in our Russian history lessons. We spent three days in Moscow then took the overnight train to St Petersburg. I remember feeling really excited about it. I had never been on an overnight train journey before. We went to the theatre on our last evening in Moscow and then went straight to the station to get on the train at about 11 pm. There were four of us in each room and our whole group occupied about two carriages of the train. Our teachers were very aware of the dangers of travelling by train at night in Russia and warned us never to walk around the train on our own. They told us to go in groups of three to the toilets so that two people could wait outside together while one person went in. That frightened us a little but nothing happened. I don’t think we slept much; we stayed up most of the night talking, but I remember waking up in the morning and realising it was daylight outside and that we were in a completely new city. It was amazing. C Casablanca to Marrakech (Morocco) We decided to travel by train because it was cheap and it only took three hours. Also, I thought a train journey through the desert would be interesting and different. In reality it wasn’t quite as much fun as I had hoped. We got to the station in plenty of time and got our tickets without too much difficulty. The chaos started when we went out to the platform. It appeared that everyone else in the station was also planning to get on the same train as us. It was really crowded. When the train arrived it was a real fight to get on and all the seats were occupied in seconds. My friend and I got separated in the confusion but there was no way we could move so we just had to stand where we were and hold on. My friend managed to sit down after about an hour but I had to stand for the whole three hours. The scenery was quite spectacular in places but the train was hot and uncomfortable. D Cairns to Karanga (Australia) I went on this train journey while I was visiting some friends who lived in Australia. I went away for a few days on my own and before I left, my friends had recommended this trip; it was definitely worth it. It used to be an old mining train that took miners to work every day. It starts on the coast and goes right up the side of a mountain. It is very steep and the views are fantastic looking back out to sea. There is lots of information in the different stations about the people who built the railway originally. It was a very dangerous job and many of them died while they were doing it, either through accidents or disease. The whole journey only takes about an hour but you see all sorts of amazing things on the way. At one point it even goes through a tropical rainforest and there are some really beautiful plants. It is a wonderful trip to do as a tourist, but I’m sure the miners didn’t enjoy it quite so much."

Write your answer in 120-150 words in an appropriate style on the opposite page. 1 You have just read an article in your school magazine about desktop security. Read the extract from the article and the notes you have made. Then write a letter to the editor. How do I know if I have a virus? How does my computer become infected with a virus? Are you one of those computer users who are unaware of the danger and harmful effects of viruses? You should compare your computer to your home. Would you leave your front and back doors unlocked at night or when you leave the house? Would you keep ground floor windows open all day even when no one is home? A virus, like a thief, sneaks in as unobtrusively as possible, hoping to wreak havoc on your personal belongings like financial data, private and work files, and computer system files. For some reason, there are people out there who enjoy making viruses. Desktop security software, if it’s good, will be responsible for taking out these threats, and allowing you the supreme comfort of being able to surf the Internet in peace. A virus can do so much damage to your computer within the span of 24 hours. It can delete files, corrupt files so that when you open them, they look like a mishmash of numbers and alphabets (called garbled text), and they can infect the emails you send out thereby infecting the computers of the people you email to. A virus can totally shut down your PC so that you won’t be able to use it unless you have it reformatted. Make sure you read various computer security software reviews to get the best software to protect you. There are different types of computer viruses aside from the one that attaches to emails. These different types of computer viruses are: Overwrite, Resident, File Infecting, and Boot Virus. Their objectives are different parts of the computer with one thing in mind - destroy, destroy, destroy. How does the security software work? What software would you recommend? You need the antivirus software without a doubt, and unless you get one, you will always be at the mercy of these dark, destructive thieves of the Internet. Write your letter. You must use grammatically correct sentences with accurate spelling and punctuation in a style appropriate for the situation."

One small boy was wandering disconsolately, kicking up the gravel as he walked. \"Hulloa. Venning,\" shouted Mr. Watson. \"When did you turn up?\" The small boy came forward and shook hands. \"Here's a new boy. He's older and bigger than you, so don't you bully him.\" The headmaster glared amicably at the two children, filling them with fear by the roar of his voice, and then with a guffaw left them. \"What's your name?\" \"Carey.\" \"What's your father?\" \"He's dead.\" \"Oh! Does your mother wash?\" \"My mother's dead, too.\" Philip thought this answer would cause the boy a certain awkwardness, but Venning was not to be turned from his facetiousness for so little. \"Well, did she wash?\" he went on. \"Yes,\" said Philip indignantly. \"She was a washerwoman then?\" \"No, she wasn't.\" \"Then she didn't wash.\" The little boy crowed with delight at the success of his dialectic. Then he caught sight of Philip's foot. \"What's the matter with your foot?\" Philip instinctively tried to withdraw and hid it behind the one which was whole. \"I've got a club foot.\" he answered. \"How did you get it?\" \"I've always had it.\" \"Let's have a look.\" \"No.\" \"Don't then.\" The little boy accompanied the words with a sharp kick on Philip's shin, which Philip did not expect and thus could not guard against. The pain was so great that it made him gasp, but greater than the pain was the surprise. He did not know why Venning kicked him. He had not the presence of mind to give him a black eye. Besides, the boy was smaller than he, and he had read in The Boy's Own paper that it was a mean thing to hit anyone smaller than yourself. While Philip was nursing his shin, a third boy appeared and his tormentor left him. In a little while he noticed that the pair were talking about him, and he felt they were looking at his feet. He grew hot and uncomfortable. But others arrived, a dozen together, and they began to talk about their doings during the holidays, where they had been, and what wonderful cricket they had played. A few new boys appeared, and with these presently Philip found himself talking. He was shy and nervous. He was anxious to make himself pleasant. but he could not think of anything to say. He was asked a great many questions and answered them all quite willingly. One boy asked him whether he could play cricket. \"No,\" answered Philip. \"I've got a club foot.\" The boy looked down quickly and reddened. Philip saw that he felt he had asked an unseemly question. He was too shy to apologise and looked at Philip awkwardly. 31 What does 'strides' mean in line 3, column 1? A. brooms B. leaps C. steps D. yells 32 When Philip is shown around the school, it is A. mostly empty. B. bright and cheerful. C. small and cramped. D. full of noise and activity. 33 Why were the children afraid of Mr. Watson? A. He was very loud. B. He was angry with them. C. He was unkind to them. D. He was very big and powerful. 34 What does 'his tormentor' in line 22 column 2 refer to? A. Philip's club foot B. the boy called Venning C. the third boy to arrive D. the pain in Philip's shin 35 Why does Philip become hot and uncomfortable when the boys talked about his foot? A. It was summertime. B. He had been beaten. C. He was embarrassed. D. He felt left out. 36 How do the boys who interact with Philip directly react to his club foot? A. They pay it little attention. B. They are curious or embarrassed. C. They are polite and sympathetic. D. They are disgusted by it."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about one person's experiences of learning to skydive. Six sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-G the one which fits each gap 37-42. There is one sentence which you do not need to use. The Skydiving Experience The thrill of skydiving is beyond any possible description. Falling at 120 mph with the wind screaming past your body is an unbelievable experience of total freedom. The sport is not without an element of danger; this fear that makes it so addictive. Yet there are relatively few serious injuries in this activity because of the tight regulations and safety requirements mandated for skydiving and parachuting organisations. I still recall my first jump from 2,500 feet using what is called a static line. 37 ........... often used for those new to the sport. It is a means of helping them to deal with the sensation of falling, ensuring that they will not actually hit anything. Still, there seems to be a little slice of missing time from the point where I let go of the aircraft to the parachute canopy actually opening. Pure terror sometimes does that! It was a moment where time ceased to exist, not quite a total blackout but still quite strange. Two days of training on the ground, counting out \"one thousand, two thousand, three thousand\" and about all I seem to recall when jumping is something like \"aaaaahhhhhh\". 38 ........... After a second and many subsequent jumps, this sensation soon faded to a dim recollection as I became accustomed to falling. The first real free fall commenced at about the fifth jump. This simply involved letting go of the aircraft and immediately deploying the canopy. 39 ........... Starting from three seconds (let go and pull the ripcord) to five seconds (let go, count to three then pull the ripcord) increasing to seven seconds and so on. Once I made it to ten seconds and beyond, it became important to use an altimeter. Free fall became really interesting at the 15-second mark because that is when the real training started. Tumbling and rocketing forward by using different body positions put a completely new challenge. I learned it was possible to put my body in a position where forward ground speed was around 80 mph with an increase of downward velocity close to 200 mph – the ears tend to get a little warm! It was necessary to flare out, slow and adopt a more stable position before deploying the canopy. Doing so at really high velocity really hurts, and I suspect everyone does this at least once. It is quite a lot of stress on your body when pulling up from 120 mph to 10 mph in about two or three seconds. 40 ........... One of my most fearful experiences occurred when I made a complete mess of trying to do a reverse tumble and became wildly unstable. Nothing I did seemed to correct the spinning and rolling, in desperation I deployed the canopy. 41 ........... The bag wrapped around one of my legs. Luckily, I had enough free fall experience to have the presence of mind to see what was happening and carefully reach down and disentangle the risers. I also knew there was plenty of time to correct the problem because I was far higher than the standard 2,500 deployment altitude. It turned out fine in the end. I would say one of my most memorable free falling experiences was above the Mornington Peninsula in Australia. 42 ........... From this altitude, I did some nice slow turns and drank in the scenery of Port Phillip Bay, out to sea, across the length of the peninsula to the city of Melbourne, all in an orange-red glow of the most amazing sunset I can ever remember. It was incredible. A. There are few other ways to experience the total and utter freedom of flight. B. This is a strong nylon tape that is attached to the aircraft on one end, and to the release pin of the jumper's canopy on the other. C. I think my ears are still ringing from that mistake. D. Altitudes increased gradually, as did time in free-fall. E. It was a 40-second fall from 14,000 feet, right at sunset. F. What happened next was not good at all. G. My first experience is still very sharp in my memory."

KATIE I'm afraid of spiders. You won't hear me scream, but I will certainly get out of the room until someone else has dealt with it. Once, when I was a teenager, and my parents were both working late, I sat on the front steps of the house for nearly five hours waiting for help. There was a spider on the ceiling in the hallway, you see! I couldn't get into the house! My father was quite angry with me when he got home; he thought I needed to learn to be more independent.\"How will you ever survive if you have to live alone someday?\" he asked. Well, I'm sure if I had to I would just deal with it, although it would be a challenge. But I've never had to live alone. I had flatmates at university, and now I'm married. Luckily my husband has no problem with spiders, and is tolerant of my phobia! B. ELLIE The most challenging thing I've ever done, by far, was trekking in the Himalayas. It was something I'd always dreamed of doing and I was incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to join a trek for charity. I always considered myself fit; I mean, I go to the gym two or three times a week. But as soon as we set out I realised I was quite out of my depth; I'd never even carried a pack before. In retrospect, I can't imagine what I was thinking. On the first day, we had a six-hour walk and after four hours I was so exhausted I felt that I couldn't go on. I took off my pack, sat down, and cried. Apparently my reaction was fairly common so our group leader knew just how to deal with it. He calmly explained that we were only two more hours from our first camp, while I'd have to walk for four, alone, to go back! I had no choice. I had to continue. So I did, and when we eventually reached Everest base camp it was the proudest I've ever been. C. DANIEL After high school I was accepted into a very good music school, by merit of my audition. I almost declined; I didn't want to go to university. It was a terribly difficult time because nobody could understand why I would make that decision. My fear of heights was affecting my life because I had difficulty going up and down stairs or over bridges, particularly if I could see down, beneath me. I would just get paralysed. I would feel nauseous, and my feet would feel heavy, as if they were made of lead. I had read that it was possible to get over phobias by exposure, so I put myself into difficult situations on purpose. It was exhausting, but I knew it was important. I noticed slight improvements, but only very slight. It was frustrating. Then I had the idea: I was going to try bungee jumping. I got a trusted friend to go with me; to make sure I didn't change my mind. He told the people in charge they would have to push me, because I wouldn't jump. It was all very fast; there was no time to think. The feeling was exhilarating, to be honest. And I've had no trouble in my day-to-day life since then. Though, I admit, I have no desire to do it again. D. JACK I wasn't even trying. Eventually I found my way to an office that offered support to students with special needs; I think someone told me that I could get a free computer, or something. That turned my life around. To get the computer I had to attend regular meetings with an advisor, which I hated at first, but eventually I learned to recognise my strengths and be realistic about my weaknesses; I realised I could get help when I needed it, and that was OK. That was the hardest thing; but once I'd understood it, there was no stopping me."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about an adventure centre. For questions 1-8, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. I’m focused. Completely terrified, but focused. I’ve got a tiny area to stand on and beneath me is a 10-metre drop. To make things worse, the totem pole that I’m trying to climb onto is shaking. With one knee bent on the top of the pole and the other foot next to it, I slowly stand up with my arms outstretched for balance. Once upright, my legs are still wobbling but an enormous smile has spread across my face. I shuffle my toes over the edge. And then I jump. Back on the ground, my knees won't stop quaking. But for the boys at Head 4 Heights, an aerial adventure centre in Cirencester, it’s all in a day’s work. Head 4 Heights, one of the tallest climbing centres in Britain, opened two years ago. It’s the only UK climbing centre open to the public year-round (the only days it closes are when winds exceed 70 mph, almost enough to blow you off a totem pole and into one of the lakes). The course was set up by Rod Baber, adventurer extraordinaire and holder of the world record for scaling the highest peak of every country in Europe in the shortest time. Rod’s latest plan is to snag the record for North and South America as well, but in between he starts every day with a clamber round the Cirencester course. His favourite is the ‘Trapeze’ challenge: ‘It still gets me every time. Eyes dilate, mouth goes dry and adrenalin goes everywhere. Although the course is only roughly the size of a tennis court, it packs a lot into a small space. There are four totem poles (of varying degrees of difficulty according to the holds attached to them), a stairway to heaven (a giant ladder with an increasing distance between the rungs), two freefall platforms and a trapeze jump. Plans for a new 30-metre pole are presently under way. All can be made easier or harder, according to ability, and incorporated into different challenges, which is why the course has proved a success with families, corporate days out and the armed forces. More than half who visit return for more and the centre now averages about 1,500 visitors a month. All ages over five are welcome, but children are the most enthusiastic and ‘far easier to teach than the bankers,’ says Rod. Parents are usually more reluctant to join in. ‘We hear all sorts of excuses,’ says Rod. ‘Everything from bad knees to “I haven't trimmed my toenails”.’ The oldest customer was a 78-year-old who arrived with his son and grandson. When the younger two decided to give it a miss, the grandfather set off to show them how it was done. For the most part, though, people start off nervous and only gain confidence as they progress. ‘Everything is kept very positive. We always tell people to look up not down and to take their time,’ says Rod. ‘We want to push people outside their comfort zone and into the adventure zone, but we don’t want people to be pushed into the panic zone, which can be mentally damaging.’ Also reassuring is the 100 per cent safety record. The course was designed and built by Nick Moriarty, an expert in his field who has constructed 450 courses in 16 countries and trained 2,700 instructors. Key to the design is the safety-rope system, which ensures that if you do lose your balance or grip, your full-body harness will guarantee that you float, not fall, back to earth. What isn’t guaranteed, though, is family harmony. “The Leap of Love” is usually left as the final challenge and involves two (similarly sized) people squeezing themselves onto a ‘bird table’ at the top of a totem pole, before jumping in tandem to grab a trapeze. Not everything always goes according to plan. Aside from not arguing, both people need to be careful not to unbalance each other and must jump at exactly the same time. ‘We do have some people who have refused to speak to each other afterwards,’ says Rod, ‘but if you can both make it together, it’s such a buzz.’. 1 One problem the writer describes in the first paragraph is that A she keeps falling off the totem pole.

    "text": "You are going to read an article about jobs that involve international travel. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. WANT TO JOIN § THE JET SET? You could be jetting off to exotic locations, staying in five-star hotels, eating in top-class restaurants, and it’s all paid for by your employer. Who wouldn’t want a job that involves foreign travel? (9)  And there are plenty of opportunities. International travel is growing significantly. And citing business travel experience on your CV can bring enormous professional benefits. But it’s not always as exciting as it sounds. There is a big difference between travelling to Milan as a tourist and travelling there to spend a day in the type of hotel meeting room that can be found anywhere in Europe. It can be very exciting, but you need to keep your feet firmly on the ground. (10)  On the other hand, it does bring personal benefits, and it also has a dramatic effect on promotion prospects. Flights can be delayed, things can go wrong and it’s easy to get exhausted. Many jobs mean travelling alone, so you can be lonely. Simply targeting any job that involves foreign travel is not the way to start. (11)  Making travel your first requirement is not the way to choose a career. It’s as illogical as saying you want a job that involves wearing smart clothes. Instead, you should consider all the usual factors, such as qualifications and experience, and only then choose a sector or company that offers opportunities for international travel. The travel and hotel trades are obvious areas, but the commercial sector also offers good prospects for travel. In the retail sector, buyers often travel, especially if they work in fresh produce, where they have to check the suitability of crops. (12)  Employment in communications, banking and finance, and property management is also worth looking at. Jobs in the engineering and environment sector can involve travel, too. Almost any career can mean international travel, if you choose the right company and role. The number of jobs involving travel, especially at middle-management level, is growing. So what will help you secure a role with an international flavour? (13)  Employers look for candidates with an international outlook. A second language is a good indication of how well someone will adapt. You need to show you are flexible and willing to learn. If your company has a sister company in the Czech Republic, for instance, learning some Czech will boost your chances. Find out what the company offers as a support package. Many now guarantee that you can return home at the weekends, or they will limit the amount that people travel each year. (14)  But not all employers are like this. One company asked graduates fresh out of university to move to another country over a weekend, alone, and to find their own accommodation. And it’s as well to remember that international travel can be stressful. People can get burned out by international business travel. You need to be in control of your schedule, rather than leaving it to the company. You must ensure you get time to rest and talk to your employer all the time about how you are coping. Don’t wait for formal appraisals or until they ask for your views. (15) And realize you might not want to travel for ever. a.)On the other hand, it does bring personal benefits, and it also has a dramatic effect on promotion prospects. b)Making travel your first requirement is not the way to choose a career. c)And realize you might not want to travel for ever. d)Employers look for candidates with an international outlook. e)And there are plenty of opportunities. f)But not all employers are like this. g)Speak to seasoned international business travellers to get an idea of what you will face. h)Employment in communications, banking and finance, and property management is also worth looking at."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about various authors. For questions 16-30, choose from the authors (A-D). The authors may be chosen more than once. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which author feels that she is not completely in control when she is writing? took action in response to someone's negative view of her chances of getting her work accepted? thinks that her current working arrangement may not be permanent? decides when information given in her books does not have to be true? did something dishonest while trying to get her work accepted? is unwilling to do a great deal of background work for her books? was offered her first contract as a result of an earlier success? makes sure that her books contain strange elements? got great pleasure from carrying out a certain process repeatedly? draws attention to the likelihood of a new author getting their work accepted? wants people to be cheered up by her books? feels that it is an advantage that people give her their sincere views on her work? recommends analysing various aspects of other authors’ books? leaves sentences incomplete while she is writing? felt that her job was taking up too much of her attention? The best-sellers book club Fancy being an author? We asked some of Britain's favourite best-selling writers to share the secrets of their success. A. JOANNE HARRIS Her novels have attracted millions of fans worldwide. MY BIG BREAK I was a full-time teacher and made time to write my first novel before and after school. It took two years. Then I spent a fortune on posting manuscripts to agents. I found one, but he got discouraged when my manuscripts were rejected, so I sacked him and wrote my next novel, which my next agent loved. He got me a deal for both novels. HOW I WORK I travel a lot, on promotional work, but when I’m at home I work in my library, looking out onto the garden. I don’t want to do lots of research, so I stick to subjects I know about. MY BEST ADVICE 100,000 titles are published in the UK every year. For each, 100 are rejected. If, knowing this, you still want to write and you love it, you’re on the right track. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I don't believe in a magic wand. You need ability, luck and hard work. B. LAUREN CHILD She writes and illustrates children’s books for two to 10-year-olds. MY BIG BREAK After school, I did an art course. Then I did all sorts of jobs - making lampshades, working as an assistant to artist Damien Hirst (I painted a lot of the spots on his paintings). I wrote my first book in the hope it would become an animation. I found an agent, but didn’t get a deal for five years. I didn’t lose heart, as so many people were positive about it. Eventually I got a deal and was asked to do a second book. HOW I WORK In the early days I used to work while I answered the phones at a graphic design agency. Some illustrations take hours, and I prefer having other people around. Now, I’ve just bought a new house and have a studio, but I’m not sure how long I'll be able to stand working by myself. MY BEST ADVICE Read as much as you can before you even think of writing. And you can’t please everyone - above all, your work must interest you. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I keep stories simple, but always add a quirky touch - children really like the more bizarre moments in life. I also have a very honest audience who tell me what they think. C. FREYA NORTH She writes lively, fast-paced fiction. MY BIG BREAK I was doing a PhD in Art History and bought a computer. The sheer joy of typing then deleting stuff was compulsive and I started to write fiction that I actually wanted to read. After four years of rejections, I presumed I was doing something wrong. Then I worked for a publishing company and realized I needed an agent. I sent my manuscript with fake reviews I’d made up myself to lots of agents. One took me on and got me a three-book deal. HOW I WORK I used to work at our kitchen table, but now I go to the library. Touch-typing was the best thing I ever learnt. I never interrupt the flow and just throw in asterisks if I can’t think of an adjective. It’s as if the story and the characters have taken me over and I have to struggle to keep up! MY BEST ADVICE Let your character dictate the story. It could be the most intricate plot in the world, but if the characters aren’t ‘real’, no one will care. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I write simply and keep chapters short so my readers can enjoy them on journeys home at the end of a bad day. I want them to giggle. D. MANDA SCOTT She has written a cult series of historical novels. MY BIG BREAK I was a veterinary anaesthetist. On my 30th birthday, I was climbing a mountain and I was happy, but all I could think about was work on Monday. I decided to follow my heart and make a living from writing. I was among the finalists in a writing competition and from that got a deal for my first book. HOW I WORK I have a routine: in the morning, edit everything from the previous day, then I walk my dogs and write in the afternoon. MY BEST ADVICE Read bad books and work out what makes them bad. Read the books you love and work out why you love them. Write what you will really, really want to read. Always. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I’m good at judging what needs to be factual and what I can make up."

    "text": "PART 1 You are going to read an extract from a novel. For questions 1–8, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. ‘Afternoon, Mattie!’ Mr Eckler called from the bow of his boat. ‘Got a new one. Brand-new. Just come in. By a Mrs Wharton. House of Mirth, it’s called. I tucked it in behind the coffee beans, under W. You’ll see it.’ ‘Thank you, Mr Eckler!’ I said, excited at the prospect of a new book. ‘Did you read it?’ ‘Yup. Read it whole.’ ‘What’s it about?’ ‘Can’t hardly say. Some flighty city girl. Don’t know why it’s called House of Mirth. It ain’t funny in the least.’ The Fulton Chain Floating Library is only a tiny room, a closet really, below decks in Charlie Eckler’s pickle boat. It is nothing like the proper library we have in Old Forge, but it has its own element of surprise. Mr Eckler uses the room to store his wares, and when he finally gets around to moving a chest of tea or a sack of cornmeal, you never know what you might find. And once in a while, the main library in Herkimer sends up a new book or two. It’s nice to get your hands on a new book before everyone else does. While the pages are still clean and white and the spine hasn’t been snapped. I stepped onto the boat and went below decks. The House of Mirth was under W, like Mr Eckler said it would be, only it was wedged next to Mrs Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Mr Eckler sometimes gets authors and titles confused. I signed it out in a ledger he kept on top of a molasses barrel, then rooted around behind a crate of eggs, a jar of marbles and a box of dried dates but found nothing I hadn’t already read. I remembered to get the bag of cornmeal we needed. I wished I could buy oatmeal or white flour instead, but cornmeal cost less and went further. I was to get a ten-pound bag. The fifty-pound bag cost more to buy but was cheaper per pound and I’d told Pa so, but he said only rich people can afford to be thrifty. Just as I was about to climb back upstairs, something caught my eye – a box of composition books. Real pretty ones with hard covers on them, and swirly paint designs, and a ribbon to mark your place. I put the cornmeal down, and Mrs Wharton too, and picked one up. Its pages were smooth and white. I thought it would be a fine thing to write on paper that nice. The pages in my old composition book were rough and had blurry blue lines printed on them, and were made with so little care that there were slivers of wood visible in them. I handed Mr Eckler fifty cents of my father’s money for the cornmeal. ‘How much is this?’ I asked, holding up one of the pretty composition books. I had sixty cents from all the fiddleheads Weaver and I had sold to the Eagle Bay Hotel. It was money I knew I should have given to my pa. I’d meant to, really. I just hadn’t gotten around to it. ‘Those notebooks? They’re expensive, Mattie. Italians made them. I’ve got to get forty-five cents apiece,’ he said. ‘I’ve got some others coming in for fifteen cents in a week or so if you can wait.’ Forty-five cents was a good deal of money, but I didn’t want the ones for fifteen cents, not after I’d seen the others. I had ideas. Tons of them. For stories and poems. I chewed the inside of my cheek, deliberating. I knew I would have to write a lot when I went to Barnard College – if I went to Barnard College – and it might be a good idea to get a head start. Weaver had said I should be using my words, not just collecting them, and I knew they would just glide across this beautiful paper, and when I was done writing them, I could close them safely inside the covers. Just like a real book. Guilt gnawed at my insides. I took the money from my pocket and gave it to Mr Eckler quickly, so the thing was done and I couldn’t change my mind. Then I watched breathlessly as he wrapped my purchase in brown paper and tied it with string. I thanked him as he handed me the package, but he didn’t hear me because Mr Pulling, the station-master, was asking him the price of oranges. 1 When Mr Eckler told Mattie about the new book, A Mattie felt that it sounded familiar to her. B he said that he thought its title was inappropriate. C he said that it was a book Mattie would enjoy. D Mattie suspected that he hadn’t really read it. 2 What does Mattie say about the library in Mr Eckler’s boat? A New books are frequently added to it. B All the books in it are in excellent condition. C It contains books that are hidden from view. D Mr Eckler doesn’t know exactly what is in it. 3 When Mattie found the new book, she A discovered that there were other new books nearby. B saw that it had been put in the wrong place. C followed Mr Eckler’s system for borrowing books. D had to move something so that she could find it. 4 What was the situation concerning the cornmeal? A Her father was unable to save money by buying the bigger bag. B Her father could not see the point of buying the bigger bag. C Her father felt that cornmeal was better than oatmeal or white flour. D Her father had decided to stop buying what he usually bought. 5 One reason why Mattie liked the look of the composition books was that A the covers were shiny. B the pages were completely clear. C the pages were thicker than in her old book. D they had better ribbons than her old book. 6 When Mattie asked Mr Eckler how much the composition books cost, he said that A they weren’t really worth the money. B they were not the books he had been expecting to receive. C he did not expect many people to buy them. D he had no choice about how much to charge for them. 7 While she was buying one of the books, Mattie thought about A how she could use it for making lists of words. B what the experience of writing in it would be like. C what people at Barnard College would think of it. D whether she would have enough ideas to fill the whole book. 8 What do we learn about Mattie in the text as a whole? A She always thought carefully before making any decisions. B She was very keen to impress other people. C She was often criticized by people who were close to her. D She had an enormous interest in both literature and language."

There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. The Tower and the Glory Chris Wilson starts at the bottom when he joins a Spanish team making competitive human pyramids A large man jams his foot in my ear and jumps on to my shoulders. He is quickly followed by another only slightly smaller gentleman who grabs my belt and shimmies up me like a pole. Another follows. My face contorts with pain as the fourth tier mounts on to my back and I begin to sway dangerously. 9 ______ 'Castelling' (making human castles) is a family sport in Catalonia. Groups normally consist of everyone from tiny children, through awkward adolescents and wiry women, to well-built men at the bottom. 10 ______ I had also heard that being overweight and unfit would not count against me. Sure enough, when I turned up for my first training session, I could sense that, for the first time in years, my ever-expanding physique was being appreciatively looked at. Castelling began almost 200 years ago near Tarragona, just south of Barcelona. Out of nowhere, it seems that people suddenly began forming themselves into human towers. Since then the sport, if you can call it that, has become an expression of Catalan identity, with groups competing to build ever higher and more elegant structures. 11 ______ Once or twice it has managed a six-tier tower. The top teams regularly manage eight or nine. It was my intention to add a little British beef to the group to help them reach the next level in time for the competitions to be held tomorrow in Barcelona on the National Day of Catalonia. At first I had thought that I might like to go on top to bask in the glory, but the club's president soon put me straight. He indicated a spindly little girl who looked as though she had been raised entirely on broccoli, and not much of it at that. It is she who has pride of place on top of the pyramid. 12 ______ For my first try-out I was given the role of segons mans (second hands), which meant that I supported the wrists of the man who supported the buttocks of the first rank of the pyramid. Once I had assumed my position, people began to scramble up me and on to the tower without warning. 13 ______ Still, my hard work must have been appreciated because I was quickly promoted to be primers mans and support the bottoms of the first level of the pyramid that we were making under the watchful eye of the artistic director. My performance in the 'hands' section had obviously been satisfactory because at the third training session I was called forward and given the very great honour of the President's belt. 14 ______ Being offered this belt, still warm from the very waist of the President, was a clear gesture that me and my bulk had been accepted. Finally, I had made it to the bottom of the pile. Being a pillar in a castell is much like being a bass player in a band. You know that everyone in the crowd is cheering for the singer or the lead guitarist, no matter how important the rhythm section. When we take the stage tomorrow, no one in the crowd will know who I am, or even be able to see me down at the bottom. All their cheering will be for the little girl on top. 15 ______ It felt great.A The best I could hope for was to be at the bottom, but even that honour has to be earned. B So I knew that everyone at the training session that night would have cheered with good-natured delight if I had done that. C But that memorable night in Figueres, despite the incredible strain, I held steady and the applause was all for me. D I had been attracted to castelling because I had been told that it requires almost no skill or co-ordination. E Within seconds I had assisted in the formation of a three-tier tower without really noticing what was happening. F It’s not easy being the bottom man of a human pyramid. G Each casteller is wound into a large strip of material worn around the waist to support the back and to help the other castellers grip when they climb. H The group I had joined in Figueres, near the French border, is very much a second-division outfit."

Inventors had first begun to wrestle with the challenge of coming up with a human-powered vehicle in the 17th century. In 1696, a French doctor used his manservant to power a pedal-driven carriage while the master sat up front and steered. The beginnings of the modern bicycle emerged in 1818 when Karl von Drais, an eccentric German baron, invented what we now know as the hobbyhorse. It was bicycle-shaped with wooden wheels and no pedals: the rider pushed it forward with his feet. At £8 – equivalent today to £500 – the hobbyhorse could be afforded only by true gentlemen, and it soon became a much sought-after status symbol. But the craze died out after a year following a statement from the London College of Surgeons, which said darkly that the hobbyhorse could cause ‘internal injuries’. [B] Brilliant minds continued to wrestle with the mechanical horse but made slow progress. Even Britain’s top engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, could come up with nothing better than a hobbyhorse that ran on railway tracks. Finally, in 1887, a Parisian blacksmith called Pierre Michaux added a set of pedals to a hobbyhorse, and the bicycle was born. The Michaux bicycle had pedals fixed directly to the front wheel, just like a child’s tricycle today. Made largely of iron, it weighed as much as a fridge but was easy to ride and took a man up to five miles with the effort he would use to walk only one. Michaux’s first newspaper advertisement in May 1867 offered ‘pedal velocipedes’ for 250 francs. At this price only the wealthy could afford one and a group of 20 young men spent their days showing off their ‘steeds’ before fascinated crowds in the Bois de Boulogne. Michaux was soon producing 20 bicycles a day and decided to organize a women’s race as a stunt to boost his sales further. A racecourse in Bordeaux was roped off, but when the four lady racers made their appearance in short skirts, the crowd of 3,000 burst through the barriers. Nevertheless, the ladies raced on. A contemporary report recorded that Miss Louise took an early lead, but Miss Julle made a ‘superhuman effort’, passing her on the home straight and winning by a nose. Within a year, there were 50,000 bicycles in France. [C] Not to be outdone by their French counterparts, British engineers set about improving bicycle design with wire-spoked wheels and solid rubber tyres. The weight was reduced to a mere 44lb, only twice the weight of a bike today. Gears and chains were still thought too heavy and complex to be fitted to a bicycle, so designers could increase top speed only by increasing the size of the front wheel. Eventually front wheels grew until they were 5ft and the penny farthing was born. Speeds of 20 mph were now possible, but the rider’s seat was directly above the front wheel, which made riding in a skirt impossible, so women were effectively barred from bicycles. To make up for it, manufacturers developed tricycles with low seats. The penny farthing’s biggest drawback was its danger: the high seat was difficult to climb into, and once up there a driver had a long way to fall. [D] In 1885, John Starley launched the Rover Safety Bicycle, the first model to adopt what we now think of as the traditional design. The bicycle industry was unimpressed, as it had a chain-driven rear wheel, which added weight, and a low seat, which made male riders look a bit ridiculous. But it turned out to be faster than a penny farthing because it was more aerodynamic. More importantly, the Rover could be ridden in a skirt. At £22, it was more expensive than a penny farthing, but its practicality was just what the public wanted. Soon there were half a million bicycles in the UK. Between 1890 and 1900, the bicycle was refined until the basic design became very similar to the featherweights that modern champions ride in the Tour de France. Lightweight steel tubing, the diamond-shaped frame, gears and pneumatic tyres with separate inner tubes all became common. Top speeds of 25 mph could now be reached. At last the cyclist could outrun a galloping horse. The bicycle was found in every walk of life: policemen and postmen had them and several European armies issued them to their soldiers. "

Identity theft – cases where thieves steal your personal data to rip through your bank or credit card accounts – is a fast-growing crime. Home office statistics estimate a £1.7bn loss over the past 12 months, which, in cash terms, is far ahead of mugging. In the US, where the crime is even more rampant, figures point to a staggering $50bn (about £28bn) a year. The government believes that there are at least 100,000 identity theft victims every year. Others put the figure significantly higher, as some people may not even know their accounts have been raided: identity thieves often stop short of clearing out an account to keep their crime profile low. Identity theft flourishes today because many financial transactions are not face to face. Once criminals get hold of data such as your bank account number and address, they can go on a spending spree. Terrifyingly, they do not need all your details; just a few will do. ‘It’s easy,’ says Glen Hastings, a reformed identity thief and founder of Identity Theft Inc. ‘The only prerequisite is the ability to read and write. It certainly helps to be computer literate, but it’s far from essential. I stole several hundred identities in my career.’ Hastings’ modus operandi was to discover individuals with excellent credit records, the very people banks adore. By impersonating these pillars of financial rectitude, he borrowed large amounts in their name – money that he never, of course, repaid. Even your home could be at risk. Last year, a schoolteacher, who was renting out his unmortgaged Brighton home while he was working in the Far East, was the victim of an audacious identity fraud. A new ‘tenant’ paid six months’ rent in advance but was never to spend a night there, instead, assuming the teacher’s identity using documents and items received through the post at the house. The fraudster managed to remortgage the property for £210,000, which he then took out of the country. It took the unfortunate schoolteacher months of trauma to get his house back. The mortgage company, meanwhile, has never seen a penny of its money back. In the US, one identity victim had her details so closely associated with a $50,000 criminal spending spree that a warrant was put out in her name. The real criminal – who was also a drug dealer – never stopped using the victim’s name, even when caught and imprisoned, which led to further problems. Hastings states that he only stole from ‘banks, casinos, credit card companies, airlines and big stores – never the little guy.’ But we all pay for that, and in any case, most ID thieves are not so selective. And even if you get your money back – most banks and credit card companies treat victims sympathetically – you will still have weeks of worry when you may be unable to access your money and may have to prove that you did not spend £10,000 on internet poker. As an actor, Carolyn Tomkinson is used to taking other people’s identities. But when someone impersonated her and cleaned out her Nationwide account, she knew it wasn’t play-acting. ‘When I found out, I burst into tears,’ she says. ‘It was all my money gone overnight. Colleagues clubbed together and lent some cash, but it was awful – I felt stunned, upset and violated.’ Carolyn had taken £20 from a cash machine the night before, but somehow – probably watching her enter her PIN and clone the card – thieves took £570 from other machines in London, showing a typical fraud pattern in the way they tested her daily limit, then hit her again just after midnight. ‘I discovered it the next day when I wanted to take out a further £20. The machine said I had no further credit available. I then discovered what had happened from the mini-statement. I rang Nationwide, who said they would cancel my card and asked me to report it to the police. The building society was very sympathetic, but said it could take up to six weeks before I got my money back. In the event, it only took a week. ‘I’ve always been very careful, but now I try to avoid ATMs by getting cashback at the supermarket checkout.’ Architectural librarian Claudia Mernick has been ‘cloned’ three times. The third attack was on her credit card. ‘I’d been out buying food one lunchtime. Almost as soon as I got home, the credit card company called me to see how I could have used my card in two places that were far from each other, at the same time. It was an obvious fraud. I was really impressed with their speed. My credit card was cancelled and it took a week or so before I had a new one. But I would like to know what happened and how to avoid it. The thieves didn’t cost me a lot of money but a lot of hassle.’ 31. What is said about identity theft in the first two paragraphs? A. It has caused many criminals to stop mugging people. B. Compared to the US, there is not a serious problem in Britain. C. It can be done so discreetly that the victim is unaware of the crime. D. If an account is not emptied, the victim will probably never realise that they have lost money. 32. According to Glen Hastings A. his computer skills made him exceptionally good as an identity thief. B. banks are only willing to lend money to people who already have a lot of money. C. he had always intended to repay the money he borrowed. D. almost anyone is capable of identity theft. 33. What did the tenant who rented a house from a schoolteacher do? A. He didn’t pay the rent that he’d promised to pay in advance. B. He used the house as security to borrow a large amount of money. C. He sold the house to another individual and then fled the country. D. He pretended to be the schoolteacher and spent all the money in his account. 34. What was the immediate effect of identity theft on Carolyn Tomkinson? A. She was shocked. B. She was angry. C. She felt physically ill. D. She pretended to be more upset than she actually was. 35. What was the situation with Carolyn Tomkinson? A. Her cash card had been stolen. B. The thieves had used her card too many times on the same day. C. The building society managed to stop her card before the thieves could empty her account. D. Her card had been copied. 36. Claudia Mernick’s experience A. shows that the finance company is usually to blame. B. proves that vigilance by the credit card company is crucial when it comes to identity fraud.

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Bridge under troubled water Sitting at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, the ancient city of Istanbul has seen thousands of years of trade, battles and invasions. Now it is the scene of one of the most audacious engineering projects in the world. 41 Istanbul is divided by the Bosporus strait that connects the Black Sea to the north of the city with the Sea of Marmara to the south. Part of the city lies in Europe, on the western side of the strait, while the rest is in Asia. 42 Recently, a mix of technical expertise, foreign investment and national pride finally came together to make the sultan's dream a reality. This time the plan is not so much to unite an empire as to deliver modern Turks from traffic hell. 43 The plan is first to improve the existing railways on both sides of the strait and then extend them to the coast via tunnels bored through the bedrock. The centre section, under the Bosporus, will be a 1.4-kilometre tube made up of several shorter sections that will be built on land, floated into position and sunk into place. End to end, the tunnel will be 12 kilometres long. 44 The result is what geologists refer to as a right-lateral strike-slip fault, similar in size and type to the San Andreas fault in California. The NAF runs for 1600 kilometres across northern Turkey, and the abutting plates move about 2 to 3 centimetres relative to each other every year. 45 Almost every quake along the NAF in the past 100 years seems to have set up a larger one, to the west. The process appears cyclic: quakes march along the fault in sequence until stress falls below a certain threshold, and then start again after a period of quiet. In 1997, geologists studying the most recent cycle predicted that the next shock would hit near the port city of Izmit, 80 kilometres east of Istanbul. Sure enough, a major quake of magnitude 7.4 struck close to Izmit in August 1999, followed by another in Duzce in December, together killing over 18,000 people and causing $10 to $25 billion of damage. 46 Recent estimates by the US Geological Survey, the University of Tokyo and Istanbul Technical University estimate that the probability of a strong quake hitting Istanbul is up to 44 per cent in the next decade and as much as 77 per cent in the next 30 years. A major earthquake and accompanying tsunami are considered inevitable within a generation. A) Earthquakes along the NAF are common. In the past seven decades, Turkey has endured seven earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. While some earthquakes release the stress that has built up on a fault, seismologists have come to realise that others simply shift it along the fault, leaving it even more prone to slip.B) Two road bridges cross the strait and there are plans for a third, but ever since the Ottoman sultan Abdul Mecit suggested it in 1860, city leaders have dreamed of building a tunnel to link the two halves of the city.C) Seismologists agree that the most recent quakes on the NAF have shifted the stress steadily closer to Istanbul. Now the question isn’t if a major earthquake will strike the city, but when.D) Today, crossing the Bosporus means either a 3-hour trip by rail and ferry, or braving grid lock in narrow, 2000-year-old streets and the two overcrowded road bridges. The Marmaray project, which takes its name from the Sea of Marmara and “ray”, the Turkish word for rail, aims to ease the strain by replacing car traffic with an upgraded rail service that will whisk commuters between Europe and Asia.E) The crucial factor that lets the tunnels withstand quakes of this magnitude is the fact that both are “immersed tubes”. In this design, engineers dig a channel into the seabed and float the fabricated sections into position above it before sinking them and covering them over. The Marmaray tunnel will use a similar approach.F) The Marmaray Rail Tube Tunnel, the first stage of which opened on October 29th, 2013, will not only be the deepest underwater tunnel ever constructed. It will also pass within 16 kilometres of one of the most active geological faults in the world. A major earthquake is not only expected, but also imminent. No wonder the Turkish government is calling it the project of the century.G) It might sound straightforward, but the project engineers face a major geological hurdle. Twenty kilometres south of Istanbul lies the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), where the Anatolian plate that underlies Turkey, Greece and the north Aegean is being squeezed to the south and south-west by the surrounding Arabian, Eurasia and African plates."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of an art exhibition. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Matisse Retrospective Four critics comment on an exhibition of the artist Henri Matisse. A Midway through the museum's retrospective on Matisse, I bumped into the painter Alex Katz. He looked at me, agog, and said , \"I thought I was going to faint when I saw these paintings.\" He gestured at two Matisse still life works from the mid 1940s. Already in a stunned state of my own , I followed his lead and gulped at the revolutionary pictorial power and radical colour radiating off these two powerhouses, one dominated by a celestial red and an arrangement on a table. In the foreground , were either a dog and cat chasing each other, or a pair of animal-skin rugs. Then I looked at the painting next to it, which also showed Matisse's inherent ability to depict form and colour, with stupendous results. I saw the same still life depicted on the same table with the same vase, goblet, and fruit. But this version was totally different. Where the dog and cat were, there's an ultra flat still life within the still life. it's so categorically compressed that it looks less than twodimensional; maybe, one-half-dimensional. I thought I, like Katz, might pass out. B The great French modernist painter Henri Matisse was not a joiner. In the early 20th century, he refused to join any of the popular art movements of the time. He communed with artists of the distant or not-so-distant past, from Giotto to Cezanne, and periodically brushed shoulders with Cubism and the work of his chief rival , Pablo Picasso, from Spain. But his main desire was, as he stated , to \" push further and deeper into true painting\". His evolution, a result of studied attempts to master his art, is the subject of the exhibition at the museum and one of the most thrillingly instructive shows about this painter, or painting in general, that you may ever see. As ravishing as it is succinct, it skims across this French master's long, productive career with a mere 49 paintings, but nearly all are stellar if not pivotal works. c The exhibition at the museum should dispel any doubts about how hard this father of modern art laboured to create the colourful and seemingly insouciant paintings and works on paper that have become so well-known and loved. As the wall texts in the show point out, \"Painting did not, and never had, come easily to Matisse. Throughout his career, he constantly hesitated, questioned, repainted and re-evaluated his work.\" Today it seems clearer than ever that Matisse was, first and foremost, a supreme colourist. His use of pinks and purples, clarets, oranges and crimsons, is more surprising and electric, than any other European's of that generation. Even when you compare him to that other 20th-century giant Picasso, Matisse wins the colour wars hands down (even Picasso admitted it, once). Far from the intuitive, child-like genius that some have imagined him to be, Matisse was someone who turned himself into a major artist through years of prodigious effort. In that respect, he's no different from the vast majority of artists throughout history. D Ravishing colours, flowing lines, sinuous bodies: Henri Matisse made it all look effortless. But it wasn't. Throughout his career Matisse wrestled with the fundamentals of painting; he revisited the same subjects over and over, and he often used completed canvases as models for later ones. Extraordinary insights into his process of creation are laid bare in the eye-opening new exhibition at the museum. The nearly 50 paintings on display reveal how Matisse used older works to generate new ideas. Sometimes the differences are subtle, and sometimes the works are shockingly unalike. But Matisse was using repeated images to push his art further. Later in his career, Matisse hired a photographer to capture his work in the studio. He used photographs of his own paintings to judge whether he was making progress, or whether he'd gone off track. Ultimately, the show reveals Matisse as an artist who made the act of painting into something as important, and as inspiring, as his finished works.37 - Which reviewer unlike the other three reviewers, makes no reference to Matisse’s use of colour in his work?  38 - disagrees with the other three reviewers, in saying that Matisse's ability was innate?  39 - explores some of the techniques Matisse used in his artistic process? 40 - makes comparisons between Matisse and a Spanish artist like reviewer B?"

In which review is the following mentioned? 47) A cheap way to learn how to do an activity. 48) An event opened by young people. 49) Art reflecting life. 50) Watching a film in the fresh air. 51) Watching professionals fighting. 52) The chance to make a long-term investment. 53) Someone who did quite well in a competition. 54) Spending time with contemporary literary celebrities. 55) Music in a religious building. 56) People pretending to be dolls. A) The Brighton festival runs from 1st–23rd May this year, and some 300,000 visitors are expected. More than 700 dance, theatre, music, art and literature events will take place throughout the city, ranging from outdoor events in the Lanes and by the seafront, to theatre and dance in the Dome auditorium. The festival kicks off on May Day in Sydney Street with the \"Children’s Classics\" parade of 4,000 children; they’ll be dressed as characters from the books of authors such as one-time Brighton resident Lewis Carroll. Other events include exhibitions and street performances. There will be a special exhibition of work by recent graduates of the University of Brighton Fine Art Department. All the work will be for sale so it’s a good chance to pick up a potential masterpiece. B) This year’s offerings combine tradition with modern events such as a comedy evening. To help warm up for the festival, which runs from May 5th to the 23rd, a free street festival will take place on 24th April, with human mannequin window displays at Jarrod’s department store, acrobatic skateboarders and life-size garden gnomes. There will also be a beer festival with over 100 real ales and wine tasting offering a selection of British wines. For those people who are more adventurous there will be the opportunity to have a ride in a hot air balloon, weather permitting. There will also be a book exhibition in the park and special storytelling afternoons for children by some of Britain’s leading authors. Or your child can borrow a book and read for himself or herself. C) Promoting its status as one of England’s newest cities, Preston’s International City Festival takes place 11th–20th June. The festival will have an international flavour because this year the Preston Caribbean Festival will be incorporated into the proceedings with a lively carnival and Preston’s Asian community will stage dance, art and music events. The festival will have a gastronomic theme, with demonstrations from some of Europe’s top chefs and cookery workshops given by the city’s Indian and Chinese communities. There will also be a “proms in the park”, an open-air cinema in Avenham Park and a street theatre. D) The Mersey River Festival is the largest maritime event in England this year and will take place around Albert Dock and Pier Head on 18th–21st June. Visiting tall ships will be open to the public. Blue Badge guides will lead tours around Liverpool landmarks such as the Cunard building, and voices will unite for the International Sea Shanty festival. Get into the festival spirit by trying out kayaking, water polo and a variety of other water sports for free at the Watersports Centre. If you sign up for a course of watersports lessons which start after the festival, you will receive a 50% discount. There will also be unarmed combat displays by the Royal Marines to raise money for charity, a river parade, an illuminated narrow boat parade through the docks, and an historic diving exhibition. E) This year’s festival, 21st June – 13th July, celebrates the 10th anniversary of democratic elections in South Africa. Events include a performance by Ladysmith Black Mambazo at St Paul’s Cathedral, a varied programme of South African music at the Spitz Club and a range of free dance events in Guildhall Yard. There will also be performances of Beethoven’s string quartets by the Borodin Quartet at various concert halls, as well as many other classical offerings, dance, theatre and literary events. There will also be an exhibition of art by local youths. The images all illustrate life in the city of London and provide some interesting insights into how London is viewed by its young inhabitants. F) The summer festival in Devon’s principal city takes place 2nd–18th July. Hot tickets are likely to be the audiences with Joan Bakewell and director Ken Russell at the Northcott Theatre and a concert given by Mercury music Prize 2000 nominee Nitin Sawhney. Theatrical offerings include hit comedy Art, directed by Nigel Havers at Escot House, and a world premiere of the English Chamber Theatre’s production of Chekov’s Leading Lady. The 4th of July will also resound to a Latin beat, with dance performances from the Jaleo Flamenco Dance Company taking place around Exeter Quay. The London Community Gospel Choir, the Brodsky Quartet and the New Berlin Chamber Orchestra will also perform during the festival."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about someone who set up their own business. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Starting up your own business My earliest memory is one of incredible trauma. When I was five, my older brother and I crept downstairs on Christmas morning to light candles on the tree, and his pyjamas caught fire. As he ran around the room in flames, I knew I had to fetch a bucket of water, but shock rooted me to the spot and I could do nothing. He's still scarred, and the incident had a lasting impact on me, too. Ever since, I've been driven by a need to help heal other people. When I was 18, I started studying medicine, but I never really got into it. The course wasn't what I'd expected and I took some time out to think about what I really wanted to do. But before I had a chance to start a new course, I'd fallen in love and was married. I was sad to give up my studies but I put our marriage first. We had three children, but by the time the third was born, our relationship was falling apart. After nearly five years, I realised nothing was going to change unless I made it happen myself, so I persuaded my husband to leave. lt was the hardest thing I'd ever done. So there I was, 29, on my own, with three young children to bring up and very little money. Things were bleak. I knew I had to get on with bringing up the children, but there were times I felt I couldn't cope and then I'd go outside, lie on the grass and cry. My salvation was living in such a lovely place - it was so beautiful that just looking at the landscape was a form of therapy. But back then, nature also supported us on a practical level. I realised that if I saved a few potatoes and planted them, I could grow my own. I taught myself as I went along, and learned how to use birch leaves and nettles from the garden to make soups. The children and I would go to the woods to pick blackberries and collect mushrooms and firewood. I also kept bees for honey. I'd always loved the outdoors, but for the first time I found myself looking at plants and thinking about what I could use them for. The children still remember those times as idyllic, but I knew I couldn't go on living like that forever. After a few years, as I built up my confidence, I decided I had to start using my brain again. I considered resurrecting my medical ambitions, but in the end I turned down a place to study medicine in Dundee as it would have meant studying 70 hours a week, which was unfair on the children. Then I heard about a homeopathy course, which was held one weekend a month in Newcastle. it was the midEighties, when homeopathy wasn't so widely accepted, but I had faith in it because my parents had used it. Suddenly I had an energy I hadn't felt for years because I had regained control of my life. Healing people with homeopathy made perfect sense because it is based on the relationship between nature and ourselves, rather than being about automatically prescribing drugs. For the first few years after I qualified, my surgery was a room in my house. lt was exciting - people told their friends about me, so I never had to advertise, but it wasn't easy working from home. The children were very good but I felt guilty telling them they had to be quiet, so I started working from treatment rooms at clinics alongside other complimentary therapists. But before long I found I was working six days a week. it was exhausting travelling between clinics and it dawned on me that with the money I was paying in rent I might as well have my own place. Eight years ago, I opened my own clinic in the centre of Edinburgh. I was totally out of my depth in the beginning and simply looked around until I found premises and took on the lease. I had no savings; I just planned to pay the rent with the money as it came in. I had no idea how to run a business back then. I was so naive I didn't even know you had to pay rates, until I received a huge bill! But I began to realise that running a business is a creative process, too. I was determined that my lack of business skills wouldn't let me down, so I taught myself the basics, kept things simple and, when things went wrong, I learned from my mistakes. Running the clinic was my dream. I have three treatment rooms and I treat my patients in one of them, while the other two are rented to other therapists. There's also a shop where I sell natural healthcare products and natural beauty products that I've made. These days I work six days a week - three days spent treating people and the other three in the shop doing the accounts and making products. I've learned you have to accept the negative things in life and use them to move on. You can't hide from them. it's hard when things go wrong, but it does help to clear out all the things that don't matter and lets you focus on what does. But more than anything, I've realised that it's worth pushing for what you want, because if you are lucky enough to find work you believe in, it can totally transform you. 31.

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a newspaper art icle. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one w hich fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Up, up and away! So you think you're inconvenienced by having to put your personal belongings in a clear plastic bag and arrive at the airport three hours before departure? Imagine how recent security changes are affecting aviation personnel. You don't need to be a regular viewer of 'Airport' to know that commercial airport staff are accountable for all sorts of situations both within and outside of their control. 41._____ Balpa, which has over 9,000 of Britain's airl ine pi lots in membership, wants safety recommendations from pilots to be taken much more seriously. Many pilots feel that the system is making their jobs more difficult rather than improving security. And, of course, with the recent increase in the terrorist threat, a career in aviation might not be the first thing on the mind of the nation's graduates.42._____ North, from Cambridge, is a first officer with KLM. Her job involves fl ying from Amsterdam to various European destinations, checking flight planning and fuel measures. She has wanted to be a pilot since she was very young. \"I went on holiday with my family and was allowed a flight deck visit,\" she says. \"When I saw all the screens and dials I thought, Wow, I want to do that!\"43.________ She says one of the best things about being a pilot is \"the feeling you get when it's pouring with rain and freezing cold on the ground, then when you go flying and pop up through the clouds and it's warm and sunny.\" She continues: \"Sometimes, you have to get up at 2.30 a.m. to get to work and if you are rea lly unlucky you'll get that scheduled six days in a row. There are rules about how long you can work, but after 14 hours on day six ... it's exhausting.\" 44._______ However, despite the cost of training, competition for training positions at flight schools is normal ly fierce. The RAF offers university and sixth form sponsorship for certain RAF careers, and you can receive up to £4,000 a year as an undergraduate. 45._______ Thirty-two-year-old Zoe Goldspink is a senior flight attendant for Virgin Airways. She trained for 6 weeks at the Horley Flight Centre near Gatwick Airport, learning safety, security, customer service and medical training. it's a comprehensive training programme and entry requirements vary from airline to airline. None require a degree but some prefer a European language, most have minimum GCSE requirements and some like experience in a customer service role. 46.______ She believes that since 9/11 there are more security measures in place and she doesn't feel personally threatened. \"There's passenger profiling, baggage screening at the airports, and preventative measures onboard like cockpit CCTV and strengthened cockpit doors. The safety and security of the crew and passengers is the number one priority of all airl ines today. A. Training as a pilot can be a pretty pricey exercise. Costs vary but potential flyers need to have around £60,000 in sponsorship or private wealth. Some airlines offer sponsorship, and some offer methods for borrowing and repaying this money that may be linked to a starting salary. B. One of the most annoying things is delays at check-in. In high season these can be unacceptably long and many people get irate at having to hang around. Terrorist threats have added to this problem of course and I appreciate that, but I still don't see why it takes quite so long. lt drives me mad and so I never fly anywhere unless I really have to. I'm also slightly nervous of flying, so for me it's just a necessary evil. C. Brunei University is offering a BA and MA in aviation engineering and pilot studies. There are also several aviation school s, such as Oxford Aviation Training, which offer full flight training as well as post-qualification selection preparation. All of these courses offer qualifications which are recognised worldwide. D. North won a flying scholarship with the Air Training Corps (Air Cadets) when she was seventeen and used it to get her private pilot's licence. She left the RAF when she won a sponsorship with civilian commercial flying school, Cabair, before joining KLM as a first officer on the Fokker 50. E. Goldspink says the benefits are obvious. \"One minute you can be in New York and then the following week in Hong Kong or on a beach in Barbados. lt does disrupt your social life and sometimes it can be a bit tiring, but there are far more pluses to the job. I love being cabin crew. it's the endless variety that appeals so much to me.\" F. But it's not all terrifying, says Kate North. \"Exciting, perhaps. Thankfully, confidence in the industry remains strong and it seems more people are flying than ever before. Obviously, there is increased security at UK airports but that is necessary for the safety and wellbeing of all passengers. I think most passengers appreciate that.\" G. Other than doctors and nurses, there are few people whose hands we put our lives in so readily. We are not in control of our fate when we are passengers on a plane. Travelling 30,000 feet in the air with nothing for company except an in-flight magazine, tensions can run high."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a film. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. The King's Speech Four critics comment on the film A History and fi lm buffs wi ll delight in Seidler's The King's Speech . Its strong historical context might deter those not falling within these two categories, however. The film largely involves the actors Colin Firth, formal and decent, and Geoffrey Rush, large and expansive, in psychological struggle. Helena Bonham Carter, who can be merciless, is here fi lled with mercy, tact and love for her husband; this is the woman who became the much-loved Queen Mother of our lifetimes, dying in 2002 at I 0 I. As the men have a struggle of wills, she tries to smooth things and raise her girls Elizabeth and Margaret. In the wider sphere, Hitler takes power, war comes closer, and the dreaded day approaches when Bertie (Firth), as George VI, will have to speak to the world and declare war. The director's handling of that fraught scene is masterful. Firth internalises his tension and keeps the required stiff upper lip, but his staff and household are terrified on his behalf as he marches towards a microphone as if it is a guillotine. At the end, what we have here is a superior historical drama and a powerful personal one. B Some films turn out to be unexpectedly good. Not that you've written them off, only they ply their craft on the hush-hush. Tom Hooper's The King's Speech, looked no more than a well-spoken costume drama, optimistically promoted for Sunday tea-time: decent cast, nice costumes and posh carpets. That was until the film finished a sneak-peak at a festival in deepest America and the standing ovations began. Tweeters, bloggers and Internet spokespeople of various levels of elocution, announced it the Oscar favourite, so it arrives in our cinemas with a fanfare of trumpets. But for all its pageantry, it isn't a film of grandiose pretensions. Much better than that, it is an honest-to-goodness crowd pleaser. Rocky with dysfunctional royalty. Good Will Hunting set amongst the staid pageantry and fussy social mores of the late 30s. A film that will play and play. A prequel to The Queen . Where lies its success? Let's start with the script, by playwright David Seidler, a model for transforming history into an approachable blend of drama and wit. For a film about being horrendously tongue-tied, Seidler's words are exquisitely measured, his insight as deep as it is softly spoken . c W. H. Auden wrote his poem \"September I, 1939\" while sitting in a New York bar: \"Uncertain and afraid I As the clever hopes expire I Of a low dishonest decade.\" The King's Speech takes a rather different view of Britain and the 1930s, though it's not entirely inconsistent with Auden's judgment and isn't in any sense what is sneeringly called, 'heritage cinema'. lt is the work of a highly talented group of artists who might be regarded as British realists. The film is the private story of a famous public man, King George VI (known in his family circle as Bertie), the woman who loved him and became his queen and the innovative Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, who helped him control and come to terms with the stammer that had tortured him since childhood. Although the film involves a man overcoming a serious disability, it is neither triumphalist nor sentimental. Its themes, which are of universal appeal, are courage, where it comes from, how it is used, responsibility, and the necessity to place duty above personal pleasure or contentment -the subjects, in fact, of such enduringly popular movies as Casablanca. D lt could have been a bunch of pip-pip, stiff-upper-lip Brit blather about a stuttering king who learns to stop worrying and love the microphone. Instead, The King's Speech, a crowning achievement powered by a dream cast, digs vibrant human drama out of the dry dust of human history making it a real crowd-puller. King George VI (Col in Firth), father of the present Queen Elizabeth, found his own Dr. Strangelove in Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a wildly eccentric Australian speech therapist who made it possible for the stammering monarch to go on radio in 1939 and rally his subjects to support the declaration of war on Hitler's Germany. The King's Speech plays out on the battlefield of words, not action. Writer David Seidler breathes fresh, urgent life into every frame of this powerhouse. The film's director Tom Hooper, 37, is a prodigious talent. The emotion this film produces is staggering. Which reviewer 37.does not make a comparison between The King 's Speech and another film? 38. highlights the work of the film's writer like reviewer D? 39. like reviewer D, was forced to re-assess any preconceptions they had had about the film? 40.disagrees with the other three reviewers, in saying The King's Speech does not have popular appeal?"

JOBS A. The writer I'm often accused of living in a parallel universe. The nature of my job demands a natural inclination to all things weird and wonderful. After all, I'm creating an unreal world based on what I see, feel, and experience. I don't remember a time when I didn't write, but I never had aspirations to earn a living from it until a cousin of mine entered a short story I'd written into a national competition — and I won! It was a bolt out of the blue, seeing as I knew nothing about the competition. The cash prize was substantial, so I shared it with my enterprising cousin. Now she tries to claim commission on royalties of every book I have published — not that she has any luck! B. The postal worker I love the freedom of my job. You are out on the streets delivering, and there is no one to bother you — well, with the exception of the local wildlife, of course. I've had a few close encounters with a canine jaw or two, but no actual bites. I'm a fast runner when need be. I'm not so sure that some of the letters I deliver survive some of the cuddly dogs that rip them out of my hand as they go through the letter box. In some houses I can hear great snarling and ripping noises as I walk away from the door. Still, once they are through that box, they're no longer my responsibility. Seriously though, it can give you a warm feeling inside sometimes when someone is waiting for something special, and they look so happy when you deliver it. Exam results — now that's an emotional one. Poor kids, you see them looking out of a window or even hanging around outside their house, just waiting for me to come along with that dreaded envelope that will affect their whole future. C. The teacher It's not a job for the fainthearted, that's for sure. But on the other hand, I think people make it out to be worse than it is. The majority of the time, things run very smoothly — well, as smoothly as they can with a building containing over a thousand kids. It's a fascinating job when you think about it, all those little personalities developing in front of your eyes. The wonderful thing is when they stay in touch and come back on regular visits to keep you up to date on how their life is panning out. And then you feel really old as their children come along, and you end up teaching the next generation. D. The actor My brothers always say that I've never had a proper job in my life. That's just because they are jealous, since they are stuck in nine-to-five jobs. We were always competitive with each other as kids, and I guess we still are in some ways. They crave my freedom, but I admire their skills as fathers. I love acting, but I sometimes wonder if I've missed out on the traditional way of life. Maybe the stability of a 'proper' job would be more rewarding in the long run. It must be great to have workmates that you've known for years and joked with day in, day out. And office Christmas parties — now they sound like fun. E. The au pair My job is quite strange if you think about it. I move into the home of complete strangers, and overnight I become an integral part of the family. It can often be hard for the children to adjust to a new au pair. Sometimes they are a bit resentful because they want more of their parents' attention, and the au pair is considered, at best, a poor substitute, and at worst, an invader in the family home. We are trained to deal with such issues, though, and have techniques to help us win the trust of the children and to make them see that having an au pair is a positive thing in their life. Usually things turn out well in the end, and it can be a real wrench when you leave a family. I've stayed in touch with all the families that I've worked for. F. The bus driver I wouldn't say my job is particularly stressful. Some of the other drivers grumble about traffic and rude passengers, but I think that you get what you give — and if I give people a cheery \"good morning\", they are going to respond in a positive way towards me. That's not to say there aren't a fair few idiots on the road. Some drivers think they have a divine right to go wherever they want without paying any attention to fellow road users, and others have a thing about buses and feel obliged to overtake them at all costs and in any situation, whether it is safe or not. There's a real sense of camaraderie among the drivers, and we have a good laugh together in the depot canteen. With this job, you've got to keep a smile on your face."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about two women who walked up mount Kilimanjaro. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. We climbed a mountain When I set off to climb Kilimanjaro, I was 45, overweight, stressed out and trapped in an unhappy marriage. My best friend, Siobhan, had heard about a fundrai sing trip, organised by the charity Whiz Kidz, on the radio. As we were pounding the treadmill in the gym, she said, \"Hey Tracey, let's cl imb a mountain.\" I said, \"You must be mad,\" but the idea was firmly planted in our minds from that moment. Like so many women in my situation, I felt I had no time for me, and no time to make choices. I worked full time for an advertising agency; a stimulating but stressful job that left me mentally exhausted. My husband David was, and is, a fantastic father but, like many men, he has no idea about tidying up and day-to-day chores like washing and cleaning. So I ran our home almost single-handedly. When I wasn't at work I was rushing about trying to get everything sorted out, and weekends were spent ferrying my two daughters to all their activities - trying to make up for not being there during the week. Siobhan set the ball rolling on the trip, and our fir st hurdle was raising £3000 each. We had a fantastic time doing it, because it was so different from the rest of our lives - organising a ball for 150 people, going carol singing and running a school disco. When we started training for the trip I was about three stone overweight, so we hired a personal trainer, went to the gym and took long walks in the hills. There were 35 of us on the trip, and Siobhan and I were the only middle-aged women. There were young guys who'd run marathons and girls in their 20s, but the age gap didn't matter. In fact, we were the practical ones, the leaders. The climb took four days going up, two days coming down. After just two days we were filthy. Sometimes the young girls would be in tears because they couldn't get anything clean and Siobhan became like a mother hen. lt was hot during the day and freezing at night, and we slept six to a hut. My lips blistered so badly I could hardly speak, and my feet were in agony. I kept up with the others until the very last climb, which you had to do at night because otherwise the sun was too strong. We pitched camp at about 18,000ft - just a thousand feet from the summit. But the going was very tough, over loose scree, and you literally had to scramble hand over hand. We set off in the dark wearing head torches, in a long straggling line. A full moon lit our path, but as we climbed I felt worse and worse. it was so cold, I couldn't feel my fingers, and I felt so dizzy I was staggering about like a drunk. After six hours I passed out. I had altitude sickness really badly and a porter had to lead me back down gently. They wanted to put me in a decompression chamber, but I refused - I didn't think I was that ill. it was only later I realised I could have died from a cerebral oedema, where excess fluid collects on the brain, making it swell up. The walk back to the hut should have taken two hours but it took four - possibly the hardest four hours of my life. When I got back I collapsed on my sleeping bag and slept. Siobhan, meanwhile was making her way up to the top. When I woke I was crying because I hadn't made it and she wa s up there. I was determined to be on my feet to welcome her back. Against the guide's wishes, I managed to climb back up the trail for an hour and stand on the side of the trail, crying and emotional as she came back. Even though I hadn't made it to the top, I didn't feel like I'd failed. I realised that I had achieved something just for me. We ended up raising £9,000 for Whiz Kidz which was fantastic and the personal achievement put everything else into perspective. lt made me realise you don't have to put up with situations - you do have a choice. There are infinite opportunities out there, and women are brilliant at seizing them. You don't have to have a man by your side to feel complete. I now feel that I'm really li ving, and getting what I want out of life. And next year Siobhan and I are planning to walk the Inca Trail together. 31. Tracey and Siobhan’s decision to climb Kilimanjaro can be described as A. practical, B. desperate, C. unrealistic, D. impulsive. 32. In order to prepare for the trip Tracey and Siobhan A. had to be a specific weight, B. had to tackle new challenges, C. did a lot of socialising with the people they were about to travel with, D. joined a choir. 33. How did Tracey and Siobhan fit into the group dynamics? A. They were outsiders because they were so much older than the others, B. They were envious of the younger girls, C. Their maternal instincts led them to support the younger members, D. They had to make a big effort to be accepted into the group. 34. What happened to Tracey towards the end of the trip? A. She refused to give up even though she was very ill, B. She was forced to admit defeat due to ill health, C. She was too emotional to carry on to the top, D. The others refused to help her to the summit. 35. When Tracey didn’t reach the summit she A. accepted that the experience had been of value, B. was envious of Siobhan, C. could not get over her sense of failure, D. felt relieved that the experience was at last over. 36. The writer seems to intend this piece to be A. cautionary, B. pretentious, C. inspirational, D. cultural."

Alexandria Smoke and the fragrance of roasting quail float up from long charcoal grills lining the perimeter of Suq ei-Attarine, the Market of Scents, in Alexandria, Egypt. lt is October, the season when quail fly south from Europe, tire over the Mediterranean Sea, land on beaches, and are easily trapped . Along pavements men sit on benches and puff apple-cured tobacco through water pipes. Some play dominoes. Above us hang the purple flowers of jacaranda trees. 41.______ Nearly half the world's population lives in cities. The number of megacities - those with populations of more than ten million -will exceed two dozen by 20 IS, up from fourteen in 1995. But what is it that draws people to cities like bees to pollen? 42._____ I decided to commence my investigations here because this was one of the few international cities in the world. lt was part of Africa, close to Arabia, and home to Europeans from Greece and Rome. Alexandria was a crossroads for trade that ranged from China to Britain. Strabo, a geographer in the first century A. D . called Alexandria \"the greatest emporium in the inhabited world.\" After Alexandria, I will visit Cordoba, Spain, western Europe's largest city in A. D. I 000, now a modest town supported mainly by agriculture. In its prime Cordoba was, in the words of one observer, \"the mother of towns, the abode of the good and godly, the homeland of wisdom.\" My travels will end in New York City, a modern epicentre of finance and culture. New York, writes Joan Did ion, is \"an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power.\" 43._________ Alexander's engineers realised that Mediterranean currents running west to east would keep the port navigable and free of Nile River silt. They also knew that the Island of Pharos, if joined to the mainland by the construction of a pier, would offer an effective wave breaker. 44._________ In the 14th century it collapsed during an earthquake, and the Egyptians built a fortress here using. some accounts say, stones from the lighthouse. From my waterside cafe table I can see the fortress where team members from the Alexandria-based Centre d'Etudes Alexandrines are easing into wet suits. They will dive down 20 feet where they are cataloguing statues, columns, and other architectural elements near the lighthouse site. 45.________ The idea of a place of records was not new. A building was constructed in 3200 B.C. to house a collection of Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and Athens had a simi lar building in the fourth century B.C. But Alexandria's library was on a scale new to the Mediterranean world, and the city was notorious for its aggressive pursuit of texts. Mohen Zahran the project manager talks about reviving \"the lighthouse of knowledge\". The new library, he says, \"will encourage the peace and exchange of ideas throughout the region and provide a place for scholars of diverse backgrounds to meet.\" 46.________ Scholarly pursuits had immediate commercial applications. Translations helped Alexandrians to better understand their trading partners, and new maps enabled traders to calculate distances more accurately. lt was this wealth of knowledge that helped Alexandria to establish itself as one of the richest cities of its day. A The city grew steadily as a centre for trade. About four decades after Alexander's death in 323 B.C. Ptolemy 11 built a lighthouse, known as one of the seven wonders of the world. lt rivalled the Pyramids in height at about 400 feet and had as many as 300 rooms. Fires, reflected in mirrors on top of the lighthouse, could be seen for some 35 miles, alerting ships to Egypt's reefs and shifting coastline. B l.Jttle is known about how the ancient Mouseion operated because so few written records have been found. But we do know that it was a place for scholars to meet. From throughout their known world Alexandria's rulers invited nearly a hundred learned men to the Mouseion where they lived in a communal residence and ate together in a dining hall. From these scholars came Euclidean geometry, the first scientific dissections of human bodies, a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek and a compilation of Homer's epic poems. C The tranquil scene recalls earlier times in the city that Alexander the Great founded more than 2,300 years ago. But as I stroll from the marketplace toward the harbour, I am clearly in a modern city. Apartment buildings, home to nearly three and a half million people, surround me. Traffic jams the street s. Supermarkets, cell phones, motorcycles, and teenagers in baseball caps are everywhere. D But, back to Egypt and the hustle and bustle of Alexandria. Dodging cars speeding along EIHorreyah Avenue, Alexandria's busiest street, I arrive at the waterfront. I see small fi shing boats at anchor, young boys jumping off rocks into the water, and, beyond, the natural harbour that Alexander the Great saw in 331 B.C .. E The past - and the answers it might hold - feel s impossibly distant as I wander up the coast near where Cleopatra's palace once stood. Somewhere in this area, perhaps beneath my feet, lies the sarcophagus holding Alexander the Great. lt disappeared from recorded history in the third century A.D. Also buried here in a site yet to be located is the famous Alexandria library, founded early in the third century B.C. as part of the Mouseion, the great research centre of its day. F All cities share certain characteristics. They are places to buy and sell, to worship, to share companionship. They are where new ideas trigger changes in sciences and art, where cultures meet and evolve. But why and where do cities, these centres of trade and knowledge, grow? What causes some to flouri sh and others to fade? I am in Alexandria at the beginning of my journey to three great cities to seek the answers. G The United Nations and other international agencies are co-operating with the Egyptian government to finance a new 200-million dollar Alexandria library near a possible site of the old one. Cranes swing steel beams overhead, and workers scamper up the scaffolding surrounding the building's circular framework"

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a novel. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Atonement Four critics comment on the novel A. Atonement does not feel, at first, like a book by McEwan. The opening is almost perversely ungripping. Instead of the expected sharpness of focus , t he first 70 or so pages are a lengthy summary of shifting impressions. One longs for a cinematic clarity and concentration of dialogue and action, but such interludes dissolve before our - and the participants' - eyes. Unlike Martin Amis, say, or Salman Rushdie, McEwan is an invisible rather than a flamboyant stylist. Even so, the pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs (a 'gently rocking sheet of water, the 'coyly drooping' head of a nettle) come as a surprise. The language used to distil the scene - a gathering of the Tallis family at their country house on a sweltering day in 1935 - serves also as a wash that partially obscures it. B. lan McEwan's remarkable novel Atonement is a love story, a war story and a story about the destructive powers of the imagination. lt is also a novel that takes all of the author's perennial themes - dealing with the hazards of innocence, the hold of time past over time present and the intrusion of evil into ordinary lives - and orchestrates them into a symphonic work that is every bit as affecting as it is gripping. lt is, in short, a tour de force. The story t hat Atonement recounts. concerns a monstrous lie told by a I 3-year-old girl. a lie that will send her older sister's lover away to jail and that will shatter the family's staid , upper-middle-class existence. As in so many earlier McEwan's novels, this shocking event will expose psychological fault lines running through his characters' lives and force them to confront a series of moral choices. lt will also underscore the class tensions that existed in England of the 1930s and the social changes wrought by World War 11. C. If you knew for a fact that you'd ruined someone's life - two lives, really- how would you make amends? That's the question the stark title of lan McEwan's beautiful but wrenching, well-paced new novel refers to. Atonement is about a crime and its consequences over the course of six decades: In the mid-thirties, a precocious young girl with an overactive imagination helps to wrongly accuse an innocent man , and it is not until 1999 that she finds a kind of absolution. But this book, McEwan's grandest and most ambitious yet, is much more than the story of a single act of atonement. In his compact and clockwork-precise earlier fictions, McEwan, whose previous novel Amsterdam won the Booker in 1998, liked to show how relationships and people can disintegrate in ways that manage to seem both shocking and inevitable. D. Minor resemblances between this novel by lan McEwan and Henry James's What Maisie Knew have already been noticed and are of some interest. McEwan's new novel , which strikes me as easi ly his finest, has a frame that is properly hinged and jointed and apt for the conduct of the 'march of action', which James described as 'the only thing that really, for me, at least, w ill produce L'Oeuvre.' Not quite how McEwan would put it, perhaps. but still t he substance of his method, especial ly if one adds a keen technical interest in another Jamesian obsession , the point of view. H is central character is a 13-year-old girl called Briony, already a maker of stories and plays and so already a writer of fict ions that have only their own kind of truth and are dependent on fantasies which readers are invited to share. with whatever measure of scepticism or credulity they can muster. Which reviewer 37. like reviewer A, makes comparisons between McEwan and other writers? 38. disagrees with the other three reviewers, by finding the novel's structure  unsatisfactory? 39. believes this to be the author’s best work to date? 40. examines the question of morality in the piece like reviewer C?"

Places to visit around the world A Preah Vihear, Cambodia This enigmatic temple/ fortress near the Thai/ Cambodian border welcomed tourists until, in 1993, the Khmer Rouge settled here. Though they soon left, it was ten years before Preah Vihear was completely reopened - Cambodia finally finished the access road in 2003. The original temple was started in the 9th century, although it was subsequently maintained and enlarged by many different kings. For the makers, the cracking views were incidental: building the temple on a mountain was designed to encourage religious meditation. The best way to reach Preah Vihear is to hire a driver or join a coach party from Siem Reap. If you go under your own steam you might want to stay overnight in the basic accommodation at the foot of the mountain or the even more primitive accommodation atop the 550m peak. The area has been largely cleared of land mines but it's probably best to stick to the main paths. B Gorgongosa National Park Ten years ago, thi s magnificent wildlife park in central Mozambique was an environmental disaster area. In 1971, 12,000 visitors came here, attracted by the greatest lion population in Africa. From 1983 to 1992, the park was the stage for many battles in Mozambique's civil war. By 1992, when peace arrived, the park's stock of large mammals had fallen by 95%. The park, a day's drive from the capital Maputo, was partially reopened in 1998. Gorgongosa's recovery has gathered momentum this year. Buffalo have been reintroduced and the park has received donations from internet mogul Greg Carr and rock star Ronnie Wood. lt may be a while before the cheetah and rhino return but 1,862mhigh Mount Gorgongosa is still an unforgettable hike. C Johannesburg Johannesburg is a bustling modern city set against the grandeur of African horizons. lt was here Nelson Mandela began the revolution that destroyed apartheid, and today the same spirit lives on in the diverse population - they are now living the new South African dream. After the end of Apartheid in 1994, many felt the change to democratic government would spell decline. That simply hasn't happened - instead, the negative image of the city has taken a turn for the better. Johannesburg has an edge, no-one can deny that, but recently it has shaken off its reputation for grime and crime. The centre of town is beginning a hesitant renaissance - restaurants are multiplying, the theatre is booming - while its outer suburbs are flourishing. This is a city where, against all odds, people from all walks of life are coming together and forging something new. D Northern India Palanquin Traveller has a new programme of cultural studies on location, designed to satisfy the seriously inquisitive traveller. Origins of the Buddha is a journey across northern India travelling in the Buddha's footsteps. Visiting important sites in Buddha's life is not just for pilgrims - this expedition stays in rural villages and homes to get a better understanding of how modern and traditional India strive to co-exist. The tour is led by scholar Shantum Seth, who is not only a charismatic companion and fascinating guide, but also an adviser to the UN and Unesco. This thirteen-day trip involves some challenging trekking and basic mountain climbing so appropriate clothing and footwear is essential. Accommodation and all food included in holiday price. E Estonia Would you like to spend your next holiday in an Eastern European bog? This may seem like a daft idea, until you realise 50% of Estonia is made up of virgin forest, including some of the most glorious and pristine bogs in Europe. The landscape is unmarred by human construction, save the boardwalks that penetrate this soggy countryside as shown on 'Light and Land's' new photography trip to Estonia. Mineral islands amongst the murky pools provide a haven for wildlife - bears, lynx, flying squirrels and elk - and denning sites for Estonia's thriving wolf population. Point your lens upwards to the peaks of the ancient pines and you'll find an array of birdlife from golden eagles to white-backed woodpeckers. On the ground, there's a host of curious flora and wild flowers including orchids, bittercress and lady's slipper. Led by wildlife enthusiast and photographer Niall Benvie, this is an unusual and rewarding trip to a wilderness in Europe. F Sail the Galapagos This really is the trip of a lifetime. This seven-day expedition is in association with the Galapagos Conservation Trust. Sailing on the Sagitta is an experience in itself - three masts tower above this handsome tall ship and sails ripple into action as she sets off around the archipelago to mingle with the world's friendliest wildlife. This trip is led by Galapagos naturalist, author and photographer David Horwell. Pick his brains on the local fauna and flora over the scrumptious Ecuadorian food on board. Help collect data for the Trust and be part of a team of select scientists for a fortnight. Contribute to the effort to conserve this magical part of the world. This truly is a 'green holiday' where tourist becomes conservationist rather than destroyer of the planet"

A week of letters This week I've been showered with accolades. it's been a week of extremely strange, wonderful letters. One letter I received was from the University of Kent, inviting me to accept an honorary PhD, to be made a Doctor of Letters this summer. I was really chuffed and quite taken aback. I kept having to explain to people: \"But you're not a real doctor. People don't actually call you a doctor.\" The other week I was on a plane where they actually asked: \"Is there a doctor on board?\" And then quickly followed with the words: \"Medical doctor\". I said to my friend: \"Lucky they got that in quick or half the plane would be on their feet.\" A few years ago, I was made an Honorary Fellow by Kent Institute of Art and Design. My gown and puffy hat really suited me and I was quite proud of them. Once when I was a guest speaker at the Oxford Union, I said to the union President, about half-an-hour before the talk: \"Is there somewhere where I can change into my gown?\" At which he just presumed I meant a dress by some top fashion designer. When I appeared in my university gown and hat he said: \"Where did you get that from?\" I replied: \"What? Do you think I stole it?\" and I remember, when I walked into the grand hall, I'd never heard so many wolf whistles. But it is odd that if you are a little bit rough around the edges, and you have a good education, let's say you went to a good university, people somehow think that your dad must have pulled a few strings to get you there. I must admit it really winds me up the way that people make assumptions about you just from the way that you speak. it's not so much about a regional accent, it's more a class thing. I try to take people as I find them. You never know what you might miss out on if you dismiss somebody from the first moment you meet them. I like being a doctor of letters. I think it suits me. And people who know me really well know that I like sending all manner of missives and notes through the post. I like it in an old-fashioned kind of way. it's how I imagine myself being when I am old and happy, sitting cosy by the fire with a cat who has broken the Guinness Book of Records for being the oldest cat on the planet. Happily sitting there, writing letters and sending them out into the ether. I love that familiar plop as a letter or package lands on the floor by my front door. There's always the excitement of the unknown as you go to open it. I guess I'm just like a kid at Christmas wondering what's inside the sparkling parcel. I have received some cracking letters this week. One from Africa - an ex-mercenary putting me straight. it's a fascinating letter that describes the whole history of the mercenaries. it was a very thoughtful, sophisticated letter - something which would be quite hard to achieve in conversation. That's what is so amazing about letters, there's a timelessness about them, where the thoughts hang in space and then you have time to deal with these thoughts. Especially in terms of an argument which, for the record, I am absolutely useless at. I have no chance of ever winning an argument. I am too emotional and react very immaturely to certain situations. Back to the letters. I had a lovely one from the NSPCC who want to induct me into the third NSPCC Hall of Fa me for the support I have given them over the last few years. I became all teary when I read the letter. When you speak on behalf of people or children who don't have a voice, that's the reward in doing it, hoping that you are making a difference somewhere. But to be honoured for doing it is really lovely. Even my cat received a letter today with a big pack of cat food. The letter was really cute and put a smile on my face. But not as half as big a smile as the letter I received last Friday. \"May I offer my sincere apologies that you did not receive the letter of 28th November. I have the greatest pleasure in inviting you, on behalf of the Council and Senate of the College, to accept an Honorary Doctorate of the Royal College of Art\" - a double doctorate! Now who shall I write to tell them my news? 31.How did the writer feel about receiving the letter from the University of Kent? A. She had been expecting to receive something like that. B. She was quite arrogant about it. C. She wasn’t quite sure what it entailed. D. It came out of the blue. 32. The President of the Oxford Union A. assumed that she only wore fashionable clothes. B. deliberately offended her. C. thought she looked ridiculous in her gown. D. had preconceptions about her. 33. The writer believes that A. too many people rely on their parents to help them out in life. B. she lives in a generally classist society. C. her father could have done more to help her. D. she has missed out on a lot of opportunities in the past. 34. Why did the ex-mercenary write to her? A. To introduce her to his particular field of interest. B. To inform her on a subject that she had misunderstood. C. To try to persuade her to support a particular cause. D. To help her with an educational study. 35. The writer believes that letters A. are the most sophisticated form of modern communication. B. will remain when all other forms of communication no longer exist. C. let the reader absorb information and formulate a response. D. incite argument more than speech does. 36. Why is the writer so pleased in the final paragraph? A. Because she has gained more public recognition. B. Because she has finally received an apology from The Royal College of Art. C. Because she finds the idea of her cat getting a letter very amusing. D. Because she doesn’t know if she should write lots of letters."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a newspaper article. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Bad moods aren’t necessarily bad for you. A two-minute film of penguins is a sure-fire way to improve a person's mood. There's something about penguins slip-sliding on the ice that seems to make everyone smile, a fact that psychologists have put to good use in their laboratory investigations of mood. 41 Moods, and bad moods in particular, often appear to come from nowhere. We all have a tendency to notice the negative feelings rather than the positive feelings, but the good news is that we are happier than we tend to think. When a leading Canadian psychologist asked people to keep a diary of every mood they experienced throughout the day, it was the negative moods that predominated. But when he paged the people at random intervals and asked them how they were feeling at that exact moment, it was clear that they felt good most of the time. 42 Moods are not just feelings we experience; they affect the way our minds work. When we are feeling happy we notice a lot of what's going on around us, but the moment anxiety strikes our attention narrows. If you're phobic about spiders, once you realise you're in a room with a spider, you focus on that and disregard almost everything else. 43 Moods even influence the way we retrieve memories. A person feeling sad finds it easier to remember other sad occasions, while a happy person remembers other happy times. This can make it hard to shake off a bad mood. While you sit fuming with anger that a friend of yours has upset you, happy events do not tend to pop into your head. Instead you are more likely to think of other times when friends have let you down. 44 Hope – the feeling that good things might happen in the future – is so powerful that it can even affect our health. Hope gives us energy, and research has shown that hopeful people are more likely to succeed in work, in sport, in academia and in politics. They are also happier and better at both persevering with a task and solving problems. 45 Positive emotions have clear and tangible benefits – hope can even make you live longer. But however destructive they seem, even temper tantrums and sulks have their uses. Emotions are all about communication. They give us information about the way other people feel. If no one ever got angry with you or stopped talking to you, you might never know you had upset them. 46 Looking at the research on moods, it is clear that we don't need to be afraid of our negative emotions. We imagine that it's essential to get control of our bad moods, and it's true that emotional management is a crucial part of our personal development and relationships. But there is another aspect to our emotional ups and downs: our feelings have important things to tell us, and we do well to listen to them. A In one study, which shows just what sort of ramifications this could have, job interviewers who were feeling happy (because they'd just been told they had done well on a test) rated applicants more positively and were more likely to say they would hire them. Meanwhile, the interviewers who were told they had done badly on the test viewed applicants less favourably. B Now, it could be argued that this is all a media stunt. Following a thoroughly frustrating half hour listening to unbearable music while you wait to get through to a call centre, only to find that they cannot solve your problem, you might well feel pretty angry. But eventually, and probably without consciously thinking about it, you will distract. You are employing coping strategies to help to change your mood. C If words are flashed up on a computer screen it takes us longer to read a word associated with our anxieties than other words. So people with eating disorders take a fraction of a second longer to read words such as 'food' and 'meal' than everyone else. Because these words make a person anxious, they actually slow down their thinking. D Also, anger readies our bodies for attack, giving us extra vigour that might prove essential in a fight. No other emotion is able to keep the body at a high pitch for such long periods. Energy is directed towards the muscles, a feature that many sports people use to their advantage, deliberately stoking up their anger towards their opponent. E One reason why hopeful people succeed is that they set themselves higher goals and more goals at a time, which buffers them against disappointment if one plan does not work out. In one extraordinary study, students' feelings of hope when they started college were a better predictor of their final results six years later than their entrance exam marks. Levels of hope even foretold the students who were later to drop out. F Indeed we are far more likely to notice and remember negative moods. Whether it's anger, fear or pure joy, moods can feel overwhelming and beyond our control. Just one careless comment or email can trigger a new mood. They change very fast. G Take part in an experiment on mood and the chances are that you will be shown a video of penguins. Over the past decades, in particular, psychologists have been using such laboratory experiments to investigate what moods are and why it is that they can fire us up one moment and drain us of energy the next."

Four critics comment on the experience. A I first saw Venice in June 1984. It was a sewer. I had arrived in Rome with an insane man (a misanthropic friend with all the composure of a bag of cats), his new wife, and an image of myself sitting in a white suit in the Piazza San Marco listening to violins while pigeons flew. Lord knows where this image came from. I had never read Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice nor seen Katharine Hepburn in Summertime. I picked up the suit in Rome, ditched my friends and drove to Florence and on to Venice. At a mediocre trattoria on my first evening, I met a photographer, a young woman from Mexico travelling through Italy. After snapping a picture of me in the suit, standing among the pigeons in the Piazza San Marco while violins whined the Beatles, she skipped town. Following a quick tour of the Doge's Palace, I also fled Tyrol. B My dream has always been to spend Christmas in Venice, during the off-peak season. This was brought on by reading a travel article about a writer who did just that years ago – it sounded just magical. This year my dream came true. I have always had a real passion for Venice and with my love of photography, it’s a totally unique destination. My husband Brian and I spent 12 days in Venice for Christmas and New Year and we revelled in the absence of ostentatious decorations that are unfortunately so common back home. We left home on the 21st of December arriving in glorious sunshine that lasted for the whole holiday. There is nothing more pleasurable than arriving by water taxi, especially with the light streaming onto the palazzi of the Grand Canal, turning them to burnished gold with the light once again reflected back into the canal streaked gold and blue; just divine, and the thing of Venice legends. Speeding along towards the Grand Canal it’s the light that seduces you every time and makes you feel so very alive. C Venice at Christmas time is truly magical. The misty grey weather makes Venice hauntingly beautiful and absolutely enchanting. Canals seem to belong, once again, to those long-lost centuries; past and ancient palaces seem to float upon white clouds. Ancient history and magical kingdoms meet in a delightful experience you'll never forget. Venice at Christmas is surprisingly lacking the tourist crowds. Instead, you'll find it full of locals and Christmas markets. Most of the main squares or campos have a market. Plenty of delightful Christmas concerts are held throughout Venice. They are easily discovered by reading the posters around the city or asking your hotel for advice. La Pietà church on the Riva degli Schiavoni, where Vivaldi was once choir master, hosts some of the best. If you would like to experience Venice in all its magnificence and you have a big budget for sumptuous luxury, then the following hotels are the ones I can recommend. D True to its authentic nature, Christmas is not a big commercial event in Venice. Typical Christmas decorations such as lights, garlands and trees are confined to the busiest parts of the city: the Merceria, the Rialto and San Marco – mercifully not thronged with masses of tourists at this time of year. Occasionally, one can see a window or a balcony timidly decorated. Nativity scenes, or presepi, on the other hand, are much dearer to the Italians. After all, the first Nativity scene is said to have been the creation of Saint Francis. It was a living one and took place in Greccio, a small town south of Assisi, in 1223. Christmas trees, Germanic in origin, came to Italy, and the rest of the world, via England and the United States and much later than the presepi. You can find Christmas trees in Venice, even natural ones, but only rarely in public areas. Which reviewer 37 disagrees with the other three reviewers, finding Venice over-crowded and unpleasant?  38  like D, refers to the understated way that Venetians celebrate Christmas? 39 like C, refers to the captivating nature of Venice?  40  comments on the lack of tourists at Christmas time in the city?

    "text": "You are going to read some horoscopes. For questions 47–56, choose from the horoscopes (A–F). The horoscopes may be chosen more than once. In which horoscope is the following mentioned?  47 There's a hidden side to something someone says. 48 Boring people seem to have featured in your life lately. 49 More is less in some situations. 50 Don’t let someone force you to make a hasty decision. 51 Your finances are your own business. 52 Someone special needs your undivided attention. 53 To take advantage of a situation you need to be adaptable. 54 Don’t get carried away by your positive feelings. 55 People tend to be cautious of positive things. 56 It’s time to recharge your batteries. Horoscopes A At times you'll wonder how many major roles you're meant to play in the lives of others. Instead of trying to keep everybody happy, focus on a4 one-to-one relationship that's suffering from neglect. Do whatever it takes to rejuvenate it. A close relationship is about to go through a magical phase, and although you should relax and enjoy it, there will still be tricky topics to tackle. Remember: too many words can weaken even the strongest argument. As a certain situation becomes untenable, it's not your job to make everything perfect for everybody. You could try detaching yourself, as long as those concerned don't start wondering why they're being given the cold shoulder. Be tactful. It may not be until you look back on this week that you realise it was a watershed. That's mostly because you'll be so absorbed by sudden offers and the dilemmas left over from recent events. With things moving so swiftly, you'll have to leave details for later. But you'll soon realise that developments are only the first stage in a series of brilliant ideas and changing situations that lasts until the end of the month. Knowing that, you can afford to aim higher than you would otherwise. Be sure to get to grips with minor problems now - you're in line for one or two wonderful experiences and mustn't be preoccupied with mundane concerns. And certainly don't allow anyone to question how much you're spending on yourself. C Most people are wary of offers that seem too good to be true. However, by now you've probably realised that what came your way last week could change your life. This fantastic trend continues this week, the only problem being that you must respond swiftly, probably before midweek. From that point onwards the mood changes. This might not be much fun but it gives you a chance to investigate what you've got yourself involved in and undertake the first of many sessions of fine-tuning future arrangements. Don't be unnerved by unexpected developments - you'll find strengths you never knew you had. You'll develop an air of optimism. Just remember to take a reality check once in a while. D ] You don't regard yourself as a control freak, or you | didn't, until recently, when numerous decisions were | taken out of your hands. Things haven't been that | bad. You've just been cornered into dealing with tedious people, being dutiful and doing what you dis- | like. However, as you're now discovering, each cleared up a potential obstacle. By the end of the month, not only will the tide turn your way, some of what you have learnt dealing with those loathsome tasks will prove to be unexpectedly handy. If others | tell you something serious, don't freak out, and cer- | tainly don't feel you have to provide instant solutions if you're suddenly offered an ultimatum. You're } sometimes seen as a bit of a pushover - prove that | you're anything but. E Exciting developments earlier this month made you realise that to make the most of what's coming your way, you'll have to be flexible about existing arrangements and future plans. Exhausting as the resulting juggling of plans is, you can't help but be intrigued by what - and who - has come your way. Taking advantage of this requires a serious rethink of elements of your life you'd regarded as set in stone. This takes you in new directions that shake things up. If this seems too much trouble, think of times in the past when you gave similar things a go | and, ultimately, were relieved you did. Try to build into your routine regular intervals during which you can be as light-hearted as you want. You may feel that others are trying to make you work non-stop. They're not. F You'll feel on top of the world at times, but if certain colleagues or associates swear they're on your side, watch out. Some people will try to use words that disguise their true motives, rather than reveal them, don't fall for it. This might be a good time to take a well-earned break and | don't just mean a day or two off work to catch up with the housework. Why not book yourself a last-minute cheap flight to somewhere that you've never been to before. Experience something new and put something back into your creative system instead of giv- | ing out all the time. We all need inspiration every now and again and you are well overdue a refuelling session. You'll bounce back with a strength that you haven't felt for years."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about a woman who looks after orphaned gorillas and monkeys. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) wh ich you think fits best according to the text. A day in the life of a wildlife conservationist At half five, bangl I'm awake. I hear the chimps calling outside. If I'm hand-rearing an infant gorilla or chimpanzee then it's the first thing I see, sprawled across my chest or in the crook of my arm. I splash water on my face, scrape my hair back and get dressed - though putting jeans on with a gorilla holding on to your leg is difficult. I make milk for the baby monkeys and walk to the village where the rest of the staff live. The gorillas in the trees look down at me and beat their chests; that gives me such a buzz in the morning. I was about five when my mum first took me to the zoo, and there was a huge silverback gorilla behind a glass pane, just sitting there, staring. Even as a child, my heart stopped, I was so sad. Flying into Cameroon for the first time, I had this unbelievable feeling: I'm in the same country as wild gorillas. I was overwhelmed. lt felt like coming home. In Cameroon, gorilla and chimpanzee meat sells for anything from £15 a piece. The infants are too small to sell for meat, so, if they survive, the hunters tie them up and drag them through the forest and sell them into the pet trade. In town they get more than £100 each. In Cameroon you see chimpanzees on chains everywhere. In captivity they can live up to 50 years. But infant gorillas usually don't survive seeing their family slaughtered. They die of a broken heart. When I get to the village, I'll have a cup of tea and half a stick of bread and Marmite and join the staff meeting. Around 11, I check with the head keeper that trees aren't overhanging the fences and the electric current is on. it's a constant battle between us and the chimps to keep them in. I look at the chimpanzee groups: how they work together, how they start an argument - they're exactly the same as us. The first time I heard a gorilla laugh I couldn't believe it. Lots of people believe that if you eat gorilla it gives you strength, and the meat is very sweet. But there is a 0.6% difference in DNA between us and them: we're eating our kin. As far as I'm concerned, it's cannibalism. More countries need to take Spain's example and propose human rights for primates. Sometimes I'll come back to my room and have a cup of tea and a plate of rice and beans for lunch. Food is really basic - we haven't the money to buy luxuries. I've eaten just about every type of leaf in this forest, just to show infants how to survive. Often infants come in with frac- I':JJ.iP.J tured legs and arms from gunshot wounds. When the mother's shot, they get the bullet too. W haven't got a vet in camp: we need one. If we're lucky we'll find a hospital willing for us to bring a chimp in to be x-rayed, but sometimes it's days before they are seen. Years ago, locals would hunt gorillas and chimpanzees to feed their family. Now the bushmeat trade has gone commercial. it's huge. The timber companies have opened up the forest, putting roads in areas hunters could never have reached. We're just a plaster over the problem. The only way to stop this slaughter is to stop the people at the top. it's no good telling Cameroonians to stop killing chimpanzees and gorillas when you've got huge western companies raping the whole forest. As the sun goes down at about six, I like to go outside and sit on my chair and think about my family. I miss them. I don't even consider having a relationship: this is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But I'll make that sacrifice: I made a promise when I arrived that I wasn't going to let my babies down. But don't think of them as child substitutes, this is serious conservation. I've had malaria eight or nine times. it's horrendous but you carry on. Our director is a huge support. I never cry in front of the infants. Once I did, and this seven-monthold-gorilla looked into my face and wiped the tears away. You have to be the one to give them support so they get strong. it's humbling that humans have done this to them and they'll turn around and put trust in us again. Normally at half seven I'll grab a packet of crackers and a banana and talk the head keeper through tomorrow's meeting. Sometimes I'm too tired to shower and just fall on my bed. I do the accounts and write my list of things to be done. I'll hear the chimps calling, or one of the monkeys having a shout at something. My eyes just close and that's it. 31 From the opening paragraph we can deduce that the writer A. is slightly nervous of the wild gorillas. B. often finds that baby gorillas or chimpanzees manage to break into her hut. C. tends to keep infant gorillas or chimpanzees as pets. D. has a natural empathy with the animals. 32 Why did the writer feel like she was ‘coming home’ in paragraph two? A. Because it had been such a long time since she had last been there. B. Because she was fulfilling a dream to live in the gorilla’s natural habitat. C. Because she had so many relatives there. D. Because she’d never felt at home anywhere else. 33 According to the writer A. eating gorilla meat can only be justified if the person needs it for medical reasons. B. there is no difference between a gorilla and a human. C. the Spanish are the only nation that have researched primate genetics properly. D. it is as bad to eat gorilla meat as it is to eat human meat. 34 The writer’s diet seems to be A. the same as the diet of the infant gorillas and chimpanzees. B. deliberately modest in order to stay fit and healthy. C. dictated by what limited means are available to her at any time. D. very unhealthy and making her ill. 35 What does the writer mean when she says they are ‘just a plaster over the problem’? A. What they are doing is pointless. B. In the future they will be able to do a lot more than they can now. C. They can’t dramatically improve the situation. D. They are eliminating the worst problems but they could do more. 36 The story of the infant gorilla that wiped away her tears reflects the writer’s A. determination not to get too involved with the animals. B. belief that the animals have human-like feelings. C. desire for revenge on the people who kill the animals. D. depression that has been brought on by doing such a difficult job."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a wildlife book. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. The Big Game of Africa We all know, in an academic sense, that man as a species has existed for a very long time and that we have onl y emerged with our present dominance in the comparatively recent past. The game country of Kenya puts thi s piece of knowledge into context and enables us to experience it at the deep, intuitive level where all knowledge is felt as well as known. When something is learnt in this deep sense the knowledge becomes part of ourselves and enriches our lives. 41)_______ Today this area is a network of roads and tracks and is almost entirely under cultivation. True, it contains the remnants of the Nandi and Kakamega forests but even these are rapidly being turned into charcoal and paper. I have driven over many roads in the area and walked the Nandi Hills without seeing any game. There are a few giraffe left on the high land between Kitale and Eldoret; the remaining antelope are rare and shy; the rhino and the lion have definitely gone. it is the same over vast tract s of Kenya; where seventy years ago there was an abundance of animals, today you will find almost nothing. I was hoping to see elephants.42)_________ A number of cases of elephants aiding an injured comrade have been recorded by hunters and mother elephants have been seen to carry a dead baby around for several days. it has been known for a hunter to track a wounded elephant only to come on the corp se minus the valuable tusks, these hav ing been broken off and smashed by his companions. it is common knowledge that wild elephants coming upon a skeleton of one of their own kind will examine the bones, carry them away, and scatter them far and wide, although they will ignore the remnants of other animals. 43)___________ But now pressure on the elephants' land is increasing. New strains of maize now make it feasible to grow crops in areas where only five years ago there was virtually no human population. The Masai, who until now have grazed their cattle alongside the plains game are beginning to plough their lands for wheat and corn. Other threat s are posed by the increased use of insecticides; the expansion of cities and towns; and most worrying of all, the increase in the human population. Things must change. 44)______________ Above all the pace at which we disturb the natural environment must slow down. Our startling success with the physical sciences has convinced us that we can solve problems quickly by pushing the right buttons. But in nature, problems are not solved quickly, although they can be created overnight. A disturbance of the established order is a wound, quickly inflicted but slow to heal, with the ever-present possibility that the wound may cause a fatal infection. Even a carefully thought -out and well-controlled change is still a form of surgery from which the environment must recover by adjusting its complex mechanisms and balances to the new situation. 45)________ Now, we humans and our greed are out of control all over the world; and in the same sense that a city child must vi sit a farm to find that milk comes from cows, not bottles, so most of us need to visit Africa to find where mankind came from. Even here there is a danger of losing touch with the past. Today the parks and reserves are last-ditch defences for Kenya' s wildlife. The long-term outcome is far from certain, but meanwhile it is our privilege that enough remains for us to glimpse the original glory first hand. 46)_________ Try to stay longer with each group of animals. They will reward you in their time not yours - remember they are making the decisions. There is so much to see one is tempted to rush; more than one hundred species of mammals in Kenya, ninety-five in the Masai Mara Reserve alone. But these animals are not postage stamps or locomotive numbers to be ticked off on a list. Each of them has an individual character and fit s into its own place in thi s complex system. A. The men who started Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries were men of vision. They worked against heavy odds often with inadequate resources. What is now needed is a sense of vision in society as a whole - values which accept that man is a lesser part of a greater whole - an unfashionable idea in our rushing, modern world. We now need measures designed to preserve wildlife for centuries, conceived and administered at the international level. B. Since life began the environment has been adjusting to change; today it is the speed of change which is new and potentially disastrous. A century ago man himself was part of the established order. The elephant hunters did not threaten the survival of the elephant any more than lions. The men of the Ungula tribe - great elephant hunters who used strong bows - had a toughness and knowledge which gave them nobility, in strong contrast to the furtive moral squalor of the international racketeers involved in today's ivory trade. C. There is something inexorable about a herd like this moving across country. No browsing, no pausing to pluck branches or bunches of grass, no moving this way and that. Instead a steady marching, the young ones trotting to keep up. Other animals do not deflect them; they strid~ majestically, as though conscious they are invulnerable, and all give way before them. D. In Kenya's game country, man is not yet the dominant animal and hopefully he never will be. Here, one can come to grips with the fact that for around half a million centuries mammals have been the dominant form of life in Africa and that only in the last of these centuries has man become the dominant mammal. But things are changing. In 1905 an army captain marching from Kitale to Nandi Fort in western Kenya, counted 124 giraffes, 85 waterbucks, 4 rhinos, 62 zebras, 27 ostriches and 4 lions in around 10 miles. E. The slender security of this privilege makes it doubly sad that many visitors bring their own pace with them when they visit Kenya's wildlife. Too much dashing from one Game Park to another does not allow the visitor to attune himself. The use of a vehicle is an advantage in that it can approach the animals without alarming them. However, if it imposes a 21st-century rhythm on your visit to an area which still has the slow pulse of pre-history, you have failed to make the best of your privilege. F. As well as being the biggest and in some ways the most interesting of the animals, elephants are in a sense the most tragic. A century ago they were the masters of the land. They had the run of the continent and generally managed their own affairs. No other large animal has had such a wide range of habitat, from mountain forests through savannah and semi-desert to the coast. G. Uke me, many visitors and scientists find elephants the most interesting animals to observe. There is the constant feeling that the elephants, too, understand, make decisions, have feelings, have friends. Stories of elephants are legion. Modern hunters say elephants know the boundaries of the National Parks and will smartly step inside when hunters are around. If only the poachers knew the rules and stuck to them as carefully as their victims."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a classical music performance. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Riccardo Muti Four critics comment on the concert A At one moment during the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's performance of the Verdi Requiem on Thursday evening, conducted by Riccardo Muti and streamed live from Orchestra Hall in Chicago, viewers could see the rosin glistening on a bow during close-up shots of the violinists. The performance, which had had a relatively low-key build-up, considering it was to be held in honour of the bicentennial of Verdi's birth, was the first concert the orchestra has streamed live on its Website. lt was also viewable on Facebook and other sites and beamed to an outdoor screen at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park. Mr. Muti, widely admired as a Verdi interpreter, made his debut as the orchestra's music director designate in 2009, with the Requiem . He has also impressed with his brilliant, incisive conducting of Verdi operas. B With all the hype and media attention over Thursday 's concert of Verdi 's Requiem, by Riccardo M uti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, on the composer's 200th birthday. one wondered if there was any conceivable way the actual performance could transcend all the relentless build-up. Riccardo Muti is not a musician to fail to deliver on high expectations, especially where music of his compatriot, Giuseppe Verdi , is concerned . The concert, which was streamed live and free on the Internet to an international audience, provided a terrific exemplar to the world of the remarkable partnership of M uti and the Chicago musicians, with this riveting and combustible performance of Verdi 's Requiem mass. Muti 's skill and deep sympathy and understanding of this music, has been a constant throughout his career. He has recorded the Requiem three times, most recently the acclaimed Grammy-winning Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording; that preceded his music directorship in 2009. c Riccardo Muti often has deplored stage directors who run roughshod over the intentions of operatic composers, such as his beloved Giuseppe Verdi. There was no danger of that occurring at Saturday's long-awaited performance of Verdi 's Macbeth , by the maestro and his Chicago Symphony O rchestra, because there wasn't a stage director within miles to distract attention from the music. And the musical glories of Macbeth , one of Verdi 's early masterpieces, came across vividly in this first of four concert performances the music director is conducting at Symphony Centre to honour the composer's bicentennial. Today's foremost Verdi interpreter commanded an impressive international cast of singers, such as any major opera company would envy, most of them younger artists he has worked with in Rome and Salzburg, Austria, and trusts to realise his musical specifications. D Who needs sets or costumes? The much anticipated Chicago Symphony Orchestra concert performance of Verdi's Macbeth took place and , remarkably, exceeded even the high expectations for this event. Magnificently sung and played , and directed by Riccardo Muti, whose lifetime of Verdi experience and scholarship shone through every bar, this riveting Macbeth was one of the musical highlights of the year, and one of the great, memorable Chicago Verdi nights, even in a city with a long and rich history of Italian opera performances. lt was also a testament to the crackling partnership between Riccardo Muti and the orchestra. The hair-trigger responsiveness, whipcrack climaxes, lyric delicacy, and sheer vitality of the playing were technically faultless and , often, astounding. This roiling, powerful Macbeth marks the finest achievement yet from Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, even surpassing the Othelo performances of two years ago.Which reviewer 37. compares this Muti performance with a previous one with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra?  38. implies that the performance exceeded expectations, like reviewer D? 39. disagrees with the other three reviewers, saying that the performance was not as hotly anticipated as might be expected? 40. highlights the technology used to broadcast the performance, like reviewer A?"

    "text": "You are going to read some book reviews about earth exploration. For questions 47 - 56, choose from the reviews (A-F). The reviews may be chosen more than once.In which review is the following mentioned? 47 Someone who left almost no stone unturned around the world. 48 The surprising anonymity of someone. 49 Disappointment that flora and other fauna are not mentioned. 50 A book that is physically difficult to carry around with you. 51 Some details are inaccurate in this book. 52 Information written like an old-fashioned diary. 53 Text that adds something to the images. 54 A collaboration that produced great results. 55 A book that covers all of nature’s seasons. 56 A wide variety of subject matter. Book Reviews on Earth exploration A. A Complete Guide to Life in a Cold Climate by Richard Sale This book is packed with information and deserves to be the ultimate Arctic wildlife guide for a long time to come. It begins well, with an introduction to Arctic geology, climate and habitats, an overview of all the people living and working in the region. The oulk of the book is an extensive field guide to Arctic birds and mammals, with distribution maps and information on confusing species. Its scope is broad and generous, but | have a few niggles. It should really include Arctic plants, fish and invertebrates. This would have doubled the size of the book and made it unwieldy and impractical, but it’s fair to say that the title is misleading. But I’m being picky here, and these minor shortcomings don't detract from the overall value of the book. B. Burton Holmes Travelogues Burton Holmes was the greatest traveller not just of his own time out perhaps of all time. A pretty big claim, but there’s evidence to oack it up. Over a 60-year period, Holmes visited nearly every country on the planet, photographed all he saw, and invented the term ‘travelogue’. His pictures are stunning, both as social history and as art. Holmes photographed everything: the dead on battlefields; the running of bulls in Spain; a mule train in Death Valley. A sequence of Vesuvius erupting in 1906 includes a shot of a woman under an ash-strewn sky that is positively apocalyptic, but Holmes’ work wasn’t restricted to the large canvas - he was as capable of capturing an intimate portrait of a chicken vendor in a Bangkok market as he was revealing the vastness and intricacy of the construction of the Panama Canal. C. No More Beyond by Simon Nasht in Simon Nasht’s brilliant biography of Sir Hubert Wilkins, he says that his subject isn’t like other great explorers, primarily because most of us have never heard of him. He had no lust for fame, instead being driven by a thirst that led him to remote environments and places that cried out for exploration, rather than towards the popular challenges so desired by newspaper editors of the day. Nasht couldn't believe “a man could achieve so much and yet be so little remembered.” In 1917 Wilkins was under the command of veteran polar explorer and photographer Frank Hurley in the Australian Flying Corps. Their mutual interests were vital to the development of aerial photography as an integral part of modern geography. : D. Farmland Wildlife by James McCallum As a refuge for wildlife, British farmland has had a bad press in recent years. Fortunately, the artist's beautiful visual journey through the seasons presented in this book reveals that there is still an abundance of wildlife if you know where to look for it and what to look for. McCallum shuns detailed portraiture in favour of sketches capturing the spirit of his subjects - and hooray for that. If | need precise anatomical detail, | can look at a photograph. But if | want to grasp how a stoat rolls an egg, how a male whitethroat makes his fluttering display-flights or how long-tailed tits work together to build their nests, then | need something more - and McCallum is stunningly good at translating these complex movements and behaviours onto the page. His simple explanatory captions - taken from his field notebook - are a bonus. E. Troubled Waters by Sarah Lazarus Sometimes it seems as though the size of books on whales is led by the size of the subject matter. This, however, is a small, readable book. There are no detailed species accounts and the text is almost entirely devoted to the threats that whales and dolphins face, such as chemical and noise pollution, ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets. A careful read reveals factual errors but, on the whole, these do not affect the thoughtful and concise discussion. It is notoriously difficult to get to the bottom of the whaling issue, and here Lazarus struggles a bit. The International Whaling Commission comes in for a lot of criticism, which would perhaps have been better directed at the three of its members who have chosen not to abide by the spirit of its conservation decisions. F. The High Lowlands by Derek Ratcliffe For some, the south of Scotland is the plainer and less charismatic sibling of the breathtaking Highlands and the rugged West Coast. But it’s every bit as wild as those famed areas, but with a gentler appeal. This book describes an unexpected Eden, a place whose heart pulses to a different beat. This is an epic piece of writing, its subject matter covered in a manner more akin to the journals of a Victorian chronicler than a modern natural history book. Derek Ratcliffe’s recordings of the natural goings-ons in this lonely land spanned 50 years. His intimacy is apparent on every page. Everything is catalogued and described in meticulous detail, and few questions are left unanswered. It’s a great pity that Derek did not live to see his life’s work in print. This is a book for everyone, but it’s a huge volume that you couldn't take with you on holiday unless you've got a pretty hefty rucksack and a strong back."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about girls and their attitude to sport. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. High hurdles for girls My 10-year-old daughter's face was screwed up with determination recently, when she won a gold medal in a long-distance run against 100 others in her age group. She is just as enthusiastic about swimming, gymnastics, athletics and football, and I try hard not to be insulted when people ask, after one or other of her sporting triumphs, 'Where on earth does she get it from?' As I am not particularly overweight nor have an appalling posture I'm not quite sure why it is obvious that I have never been in the slightest bit athletic. Going round a girls' secondary school with my daughter a few weeks ago I was reminded just how dire school sport was for me. Little seems to have changed in the past 25 years - girls in the same old, ill-fitting Airtex tops, horrible kilt-like games skirts and scratchy nylon socks. On our visit, a group of girls hung about the edges of the hockey pitch trying to hide their mottled, freezing legs while the more hearty ones whacked each other with hockey sticks. lt all came back to me; the horrible cheesy smell of the changing rooms and the muddy winter horrors of traditional girls' team games, such as lacrosse, netball and hockey and, worst of all, the cross-country run through the suburban streets of Hendon. What a sight 60 of us must have made thundering down the pavements in our tiny, flapping skirts and mortadella sausage thighs. Small wonder, then, that a study released last month about young people's behaviour in relation to health found that although many girls wanted to be fit and improve their appearance they were too embarrassed to exercise. Helen Haste, a professor of psychology at Bath University and the author of the report, based her research on 687 interviews with 11- to 21-year olds. The most active youngsters did team sports and at least one other form of exercise, but Professor Haste says that fewer than half exercised once a week: 49 percent of girls said they did not feel comfortable exercising in front of other people, while 34 percent didn't like the way they looked in exercise clothes. Haste says, 'The study shows that appearance is important to both sexes, but in particular to girls under 16. We need to take this seriously. Girls feel self-conscious exercising in front of people, while boys don't feel this so much. There seems to be a real tension between teenagers wanting to be fitter to look good and worries about how they look when they are actually exercising,' says Haste. Appearance therefore, is both a driving force to exercise and a reason why girls don't actually want to do it. 'lt is a real waste of an opportunity to have fun and get fit if school sports are making girls feel so ill at ease,' Haste adds. 'We need to think about ways of exercising within the school curriculum which make sure that girls feel comfortable.' When I asked a group of 14-year-old girls at a mixed comprehensive school what they thought of the games on offer at their school, some were fairly enthusiastic. Cathy Dale is good at football, and enjoys its competitive spirit, but thinks it is hard to get sports teachers to give girls the training they need. 'They tend to concentrate on the boys' team even though I think that some of the girls are better than the boys. I think that they expect us to give up pretty soon, so there just isn't the interest. I'm not sure if it's the teachers' fault or the girls' fault.' At the girls' school where we found the unenthusiastic hockey players, the headmistress gave a speech to the parents after the tour of the school and the school grounds. She was unapologetic about the lack of sporting facilities on offer: the message was that as the school was doing well academically it didn't really matter that the girls didn't get much of a chance to succeed at sport. My daughter sneered and whispered that she would never go to a school that didn't take sport seriously, and could we please leave right away? So now the search is on for a secondary school that will nurture her sporty side, although I'm not sure that one exists in my London neighbourhood. 31 How does the writer feel about the way people react to her daughter’s successes? A. She is jealous of her daughter. B. She is put out that they don’t credit her for her daughter’s athleticism. C. She is very proud of her. D. She gets quite defensive with them. 32 How did the visit to the girls’ school make the writer feel? A. Nostalgic for her own schooldays. B. Hopeful that her daughter would like the school. C. It gave her unpleasant memories. D. It made her want to take up a sport again. 33 According to Helen Haste, A. most girls aren’t interested in exercising. B. there aren’t the facilities for girls to get exercise. C. girls tend to tease each other when they are exercising. D. girls are very aware of being watched while they exercise. 34 Haste comes to the conclusion that A. schools will never be able to make girls more comfortable with sport. B. girls will never be able to compete with boys at sport. C. teachers are mainly responsible for making girls feel uncomfortable in sports lessons. D. the schools themselves need to change their attitudes to sport. 35 The headmistress of the school that the writer visited A. regretted that she could not improve the school’s sports facilities. B. wanted the girls to excel academically and athletically. C. didn’t hold sport high in the school’s priorities. D. discouraged the girls from doing any sport at all. 36 The writer’s daughter A. was rude when she spoke to the headmistress. B. felt little respect for what the headmistress said. C. was not impressed with any aspect of the school. D. was intimidated by the headmistress."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Art in bloom. Anyone who's been to Monet’s garden at Giverny, or Derek Jarman’s garden at Dungeness, knows that artists make good gardeners. But do gardens make good art? That is the question Tate Britain poses in its summer exhibition, Art of the Garden. 41) _____. Perhaps it’s because gardening – like fishing and DIY – is generally a private pursuit. It’s not so much something you tend to do with other people. It’s a contemplative activity that induces a state of relaxation, calm and general wellbeing. So, the Tate show may be the first exhibition to examine the relationship between gardens and British art, but where are the major artworks? 42) _____. Instead, Art of the Garden quietly opens a door into the private world of the British garden – in fact, the Secret Garden would have made just as good a title for the show. What’s striking about these images is how little our attitudes towards the garden have changed in the last 200 years – from Samuel Palmer’s A Shoreham Garden of 1829 to David Rayson’s Night Garden of 2003, what we see is a quiet, dreamlike place. 43) _____. I guess it’s not surprising that painters should make fine gardens: colour and composition after all, are at the heart of both painting and gardening. Monet may be the most famous example, but his garden at Giverny was created so long ago that what we see today may bear only a vague relation to the original – gardens being, oddly, far more ephemeral than a painting of the most fleeting atmospheric effect. 44) _____. But the current artistic icon of contemporary gardening is surely the late Derek Jarman, whose tiny garden on the vast pebble beach of Dungeness in Kent has become a modern place of pilgrimage. Jarman’s garden is an inspiring example of how to create a sense of mystery and magic in apparently unpromising surroundings – in this case a bleak shingle bank dominated by a nuclear power station. 45) _____. But tourist attractions aside, it’s the more personal, intimate images of gardens that say so much about the artist. Some painters focus on a section of their garden, maybe a splash of colour in one particular corner. Or the way a single flower can fill a whole canvas making a strong statement about form, colour or detail. Or perhaps a more impressionistic interpretation may be used where shape and form are loose and sketchy but different hues blend for an overall impact. 46) _____. But it is precisely this kind of inference about an artist’s character that is so interesting in a piece of art. Art is after all, a vehicle of communication between two human beings and this too can be said about a garden. A garden is indeed a reflection of the people who own it and that is why ‘garden art’ is such a telling and yet natural phenomenon. A. What's intriguing is that unlike Monet's garden, Jarman's is, arguably, his greatest artistic creation. But then, unlike Giverney, Dungeness remains absolutely uncommercialised. Long may it remain that way! My enduring memory of Giverney is not of its lily ponds but of its electric, revolving toilet seats. Apparently they're popular with Japanese coach parties. B. Which makes perfect sense, when you come to think of it. For aren't gardens, for most of us, an escape from the rational world of work - somewhere for children to play, or for us to play at being children again? The British idea of gardens has an engaging innocence to it. C. The other extreme can be seen in the works of Sir Stanley Spencer. Full of intricate detail, almost like an illustration. Spencer would painstakingly include deli- : cate brickwork and single petals. He must have been a man of order, discipline and precision. You can't imagine him living in a messy house with an untidy garden. D. Given our well-known obsession with gardens and gardening, what's curious is how few, rather than how many depictions of gardens there are in British art. You could, of course, say the same for some of our other national pastimes: how many iconic images of fishing can you think of or DIY and home improvements? E. The curator of the gallery has a strong opinion about this show. He believes that this important work needs to be seen by a wide audience and that it has the power to transform the work of the next generation of British artists. He refuses to give in to the political pressures that have been put on him. F. More recently, lvon Hitchens and Reynolds Stone created semi-wild woodland gardens in Sussex and Dorset, while Patrick Heron made brilliant use of strong colours in both his paintings and his Cornish garden. In Scotland, lan Hamilton Finlay has updated the garden at Little Sparta, juxtaposing texts and landscape in witty and often ironic ways. G. There are some favourite paintings - John Singer Sargeant's Carnation, Lily, Rose and David Inshaw's The Badminton Game - to be sure. However, | don't think anyone would claim either as masterpieces of European art. So the question is, why would a gallery of great prestige such as the Tate have a show that is apparently so low key? Where is the razzmatazz?"

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a theatre performance. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Hamlet Four critics comment on the play A. There can rarely have been such an angry young Dane. In Michael Grandage's fast and filleted production of Hamlet , Jude Law is alight with ire. Thickened with disgust, he becomes almost ugly. He plunges in at full tilt; he jabs with each verb and gesture. At times he becomes a parody of his own vehemence: even 'and' can sound like an insult in his mouth. Yet, against the odds, by the end of the play he has found another register. Law doesn't have the sardonic wit of David Tennant, or the philosophical fluency of Jamie Ballard in Jonathan Miller's recent Tobacco Factory production, but he makes a Hamlet who truly discovers himself. He delivers his anguished 'to be or not to be' in a literal blizzard of uncertainty, speaking amid a flurry of snowflakes, but when he comes to say 'the readiness is all', he is steady: he is not merely parroting a proverb; he makes the words sound like the anchor of the play. B. T hi s w eek we had the great Hamlet bout. Could Jude Law be as good in the role as David Tennant was in last year's Royal Shakespeare Company production? And the news from the West End ringside, so far as I'm concerned, is that it's a squeaker- and that Mr Law is JUSt ahead on points . That said, the Wyndham's production is not a patch on the RSC show in several other· respects. The company has been strangely mi scast. Its Claudius , Ophelia, Laertes, Horatio, Gertrude and ghost are all disappointing. Ron Cook's Polonius is an almost embarrassingly bad stab at the part. He is more like a subservient waiter than a fruity ol d courtier. Still, the Ron Cook fan club seemed to be in attendance at Wednesday's opening night. Polonius's jokes kept getting wild laughs from one section of the audience. At times in this patchy show it is as though director Michael Grandage has not wanted to intervene on the text - or perhaps been too busy to tell his actors what to do. С. Actor Jude Law was recently quoted in a newspaper as saying Hamlet was 'a bit like a great song that's been covered by a load of different singers' . If so, judging by the cheers at the end of his Hamlet debut last night, Law has a hit on his hands, despite a few off-key notes (more notably, in the production, itself). So it was, then , that Law took to t he stage as the Prince of Denmark in the last production in the Donmar's West End season, at Wyndham's Theatre. As the second high-profile star to play the Danish prince in under a year, the comparisons with Doctor Who star, David Tennant, are inevitable. Both played Hamlet at roughly the same age and both are better known for their roles on TV and film , but it's about there the comparisons end. While Tennant was a frenetic Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), switching seamlessly between sanity and feigned madness, Law was filled with ferocious anger, snarling and squaring up during the soliloquies, making more compelling viewing than Tennant, in the end. D. 'Who's there?' The most exciting opening scene in all drama begins thus, but the phrase was lost last night as Jude Law's Hamlet waited in the wings. At the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford last year, it was Or Who's there, as David Tennant performed the role with scintillating astuteness. Jude's sexier, though the hair line's receding- at 37 years old and like Tennant, he's a bit early middle-aged for the eternal student aspect of the role - and his voice is perhaps too huskily monotonous for someone who speaks almost half a play and over three hundred speeches . But we have to give the contest on points, if not quite a knockout, to Tennant. And Michael Grandage's speedy production for the Donmar in the West End season - coming in at just over three hours with some clever cutting and hectic acceleration towards the end - is looking just a bit over repetitive in the Donmar style of black brick and musty lighting design, with portentous sound track to match. 37 Which reviewer commends the performance of Jude Law but finds the rest of the cast lacking? 38 Which reviewer disagrees with the other three reviewers, by finding no flaws in the production? 39 Which reviewer, like reviewer A, believes Law’s Hamlet is not as good as Tennant’s? 40 Which reviewer, like reviewer B, suggests that Law has the edge on Hamlet?"

Fantasy images based on a real environment ____56. Reviews of art events A. Ben Cook and Phil Whiting. Landscape, such a dominant theme in Cornwall, has the chalk and cheese treatment from two artists showing in Penzance this month. At Cornwall Contemporary Gallery Ben Cook · uses abstract vocabulary to make almost entirely conceptual references. His use of found objects and time spent surfing drew him to look at the processes involved in surfboard manufacture. Based on these, his constructions and paintings combine areas of high resist, high speed, water deflecting sheen with those tempered by wax to produce mottled, opaque, non-slip surfaces that smack of stone and solidity. Phil Whiting is a painter. His vigorous use of materials - acrylics in thick impasto inks, charcoal applied with a brush, nife and 'whatever' - recalls a terrain smarting from the brute force of man's misuse of it. This is not the celebrated, picturesque Cornwall we so often see but its dirty, rain-soaked underbelly, a landscape left bereft by voracious ining and haphazard industrial development. B. Shanti Panchal. it is almost thirty years since Shanti Panchal first came from India to study art in London, where he has lived ever since. This retrospective at Chelmsford Museum elucidates 'lis distinctive, radical water-colourist's achievement. Growing up in a Gujarati village, he decorated local houses with images of birds and animals. As a Bombay art student, cave Jaintings and images from Jain temples inspired him, and as a student in Europe, he was drawn to medieval icons. lt is erroneous to say that his work is characterised by poignant nostalgia for India. The paintings are not nostalgic. Rather hey evoke with subtle clarity what it is like to be exiled and dispossessed while at the same time rooted inalienably in nature and the cosmos. Every watercolour is multi-layered, giving a similar surface o Buddhist cave paintings. lt can take days in order to face Nhat is going to happen in a piece. Each picture takes weeks and sometimes months. Recent pictures include por- -raits and even a homage to Frida Kahlo, a painter that Shanti respects immensely. C. lwan Gwyn Parry. Iwan Gwyn Parry's first solo exhibition at Martin Tinney allery in Cardiff is a significant event. Until now the artist has shown mostly in North Wales. Now there is an opportunity to experience, further south, a coherent and powerful assemblage of his latest work. lt is clear the show will be something special. For these remarkable landscapes and seascapes appear to have emerged from deep within his psyche and are a highly imaginative response to a coastal terrain familiar to the artist. There is a strong sense of mysticism, the painting suffused with ethereal vapours and incandescent light; there are restless swathes of deep orange and yellow. The seascapes are haunting and elemenal while the landscapes are more reflective studies in grey, black and white. His oil The Irish Sea, for example is on an awesome scale, its seething waters of churning paint intensely lit by a low sun. Definitely a show not to be missed. D. Art auctions. Of the top three Modern British sales last month, it was Christie's who kicked off the proceedings, but not without controversy. Bury district council, in their wisdom, auctioned a major painting by LS. Lowry so as to cover a £10 million shortfall in their finances. The £1.2 million hammer price, less expenses, will not make all that much difference but the issue has raised the wrath of the Museums Association, who in future, could block lottery and National Arts Collection Fund resources in all aspects of museum and gallery development. Bury may well live to regret their foolhardy action as current and future donators wi ll also not be encouraged to gift works of art which could be sold on a whim. Bonhams followed ten days later with a good but not exceptional sale of which a solid 70% was sold and totalled £2.3 million. lt was then Sotheby's turn to shine which they succeeded in doing, with 80% of lots sold and an impressive total of £7.7 million, though some way behind their arch rival. Records were broken for works by Sir Winston Churchi ll, former British Prime Minister. E. Andrew Grassie. Andrew Grassie's exhibition at Maureen Paley Gallery is aptly entitled 'Installation', since it provides a look backstage at the rituals involved in hanging an exhibition before it officially opens to the public. To achieve this, Grassie devised and followed a pre-determined strategy, namely: \"Install a series of paintings at the gallery depicting last year's previous exhibitions during their installation. Each painting should hang at the very spot from which the image was taken, enabling the viewer to compare views of the space.\" The result is five jewel-like paintings, each one painstakingly copied from a mid-installation photograph taken by Grassie before the opening of the previous year's shows. The paintings are executed with such detail that it is difficult at times to uncover the illusion that these are photographs rather than paintings. F. Story Alexia Goethe. has selected fourteen artists, including six resident in the UK and four from Leipzig, for her show 'Story'. She seeks to demonstrate that whatever technique is used - painting, text, video, photograph or concept - and regardless of style, the artist is telling a story. The tales being told made me come away feeling a sense of recovery. Tales of politics, war, social unrest, personal tragedy, to name just a few, are depicted here. Jin Meng who now resides in Europe, produces exquisitely framed views from the present onto China's past. Political statues, glimpsed from a deserted bedroom, evoke the vast changes sweeping his birthplace. Jean Tinguely's kinetic assemblages illustrate how the mechanical is subverted into the amusing and the desirable. This is an eclectic mix of treasures that can't fail to shock, amuse and move."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about encouraging teenagers to keep fit. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. Get them going! Welcome to the world of the 21st century teenager - where DVDs and computer games rule and trainers are something you wear to look cool rather than run in. As a result, at a time when they should be at their peak fitness, the UK's teenagers are lagging badly behind. A national survey recently found that many 16- to 20-yearolds had less aerobic capacity and muscle strength than healthy 60-year-olds. And not surprisingly this is giving cause for concern. Roger Draper, chief executive of Sport England, agrees. 'If they want to give themselves a head start in staying healthy for life, teenagers need to get into the exercise habit now', he says. 'We want to see more teenagers channel ling their natural energy into exercise in any shape or form.' Many parents think that encouraging teenagers into sport is something schools should take responsibility for but Andrew Findley, a former PE teacher, points out that schools can only go so far. 'The majority of pupils only get two hours of PE a week so although it's better than nothing there's only so much teachers can do - parents have a major role to play too', he says. 'lt always amazed me how many pupils would come with a note from home excusing them from PE without good reason. A lot of teenagers also feel it's not cool to do well at school and that goes for PE as much as other subjects.' A recent survey of 11- to 14-year -olds revealed that sport is becoming a less popular way of spending leisure time while the number of chi ldren in that age range who say they love sport has dropped by 10 percent compared to previous years. Roger Draper puts this down to the number of other pursuits competing for teenagers' leisure hours, from playing on the computer to going out clubbing. 'That's why we're looking to support sports such as skateboarding and other street sports, which young people are increasingly interested in. We cannot just promote the old traditional sports of football, hockey and cricket - many teenagers still want to play these but many others don't and we need to broaden sport's appeal.' Membership of sports clubs drops significantly in teenage years; 71 percent of 7- to 10-year -olds belong to a club compared to 43 percent of 15- to 19-yearolds. The danger is that those who have dropped out may not take up another activity to keep them fit and will enter adulthood with a sedentary lifestyle. While for teenagers who wouldn't even dream of joining a sports club in the first place, it's particularly important that they find alternative exercise they enjoy - or at least do regularly. it's great if teenagers show an interest in competitive sport but if they don't, it's essential to realise that exercise and the health benefits it brings are more important than becoming brilliantly skilled in a particular discipline. it's all very well talking about the benefits of exercising but when you're faced with telling a sulky 16-year-old you're not driving them down the road because the walk will do them good, it's another matter. So is it really worth the effort? Bearing in mind the way a teenager's mind works can help parents to strike a balance between encouraging a more active lifestyle and what will be viewed as nagging. Dr Dawn Skelton points out that most teenagers find it hard to imagine themselves getting older and live for today not tomorrow, so the importance of keeping fit for the future may be lost on them. 'Parents need to focus on how a healthier lifestyle can help them now', she says. 'If they are studying for exams for instance, research shows that exercise can boost their concentration levels. Girls might be inspired by the fact that exercise can improve their looks in terms of their skin as well as their figures and teenage boys might like the idea of building up their muscle mass. Sport can also be useful social contact through which they can form relationships that last a lifetime.' And of course, setting a good example helps too. it's no good telling your child to get up and be active if you are slouching in front of the TV. Family trips to the swimming pool, bowling alley or nearest country park will help you all to stay active - with family harmony as an extra bonus. If they try something they aren't keen on, encourage them to give it a good go but if they are sti ll adamant it's not for them try and find an alternative rather than insisting they carry on or just give up. Many clubs provide taster sessions so you don't have to shell out for a whole course and risk your teenager dropping out after a few tries. Maybe the most important thing is to remember that whatever they choose to do, it can be challenging but it should be fun. That way they are more likely to stick at it and reap the rewards of a healthier lifestyle. 31 What is suggested in the opening paragraph? A. Teenagers don’t want to get their clothes dirty. B. Teenagers are more interested in fashion than health. C. Older people are much healthier than they used to be. D. Teenagers won’t take exercise if older people are around. 32 According to Andrew Findley A. children write false notes to excuse them from PE at school. B. parents need to be skillful at the sports that children like. C. parents are unhappy with the sports facilities in schools. D. parents sometimes aggravate the situation. 33 Roger Draper believes that the situation could be improved by A. offering a wider choice of activities. B. scrapping all traditional sports. C. banning all team sports in schools. D. introducing extreme sports to inspire teenagers. 34 One of the problems with pushing a teenager to be more active is they may A. not appreciate the wider benefits of exercise. B. become too tired to do their schoolwork. C. insist on their parents taking up a sport too. D. resent the fact that they can’t do certain sports with their friends. 35 In order to inspire a teenager, you A. should tell them about the sports you used to play when you were young. B. should stress how lucky they are to have good sports facilities. C. ought to practise what you preach. D. should ban them from watching TV in the evening. 36 When a teenager is willing to try something new, parents A. should never pay money upfront for them to take part in a sport. B. shouldn’t force the issue if things don’t turn out as expected. C. shouldn’t risk them joining a club unless it has been recommended. D. should be careful to avoid any sports that are expensive."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article about following your little passions in life. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. 'One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested', the author E. M. Forster once said. Some people's passion may be about winning Olympic gold, discovering a cure for cancer or sailing across the Atlantic single-handed, but passion doesn’t always have to involve amazing, earth-shattering feats or superhuman efforts. 41)_____ In 1959 Dr Robert White, an American personality psychologist, introduced the term 'effectance motivation', or the urge we all have to engage with our environment to make our influence felt, and to master tasks in a competent fashion. You can see this if you watch children when they’re transfixed with mastering a game or task. Time flies and they have no sense of anything going on outside their ‘concentration zone’: that's a slice of pure passion and emotion in action! 42)_____ Sometimes passion can be ignited by things we don’t want to happen as much as by those we do. Almost every campaign for public good, from the abolition of slavery through to women's right to vote and Live Aid for Africa, started with a spark of passionate rage that grew to a far-reaching flame. The last of these examples reflecting the growing trend for celebrities fighting for a good cause. 43)_____ The truth is that passion can ebb and flow and when we're tired, depressed or despondent it tends to be the first thing to disappear. But according to Christine Dunkley, a psychological therapist, we have a lot of control. 44)_____ This is important because being passionate may help us live longer. A study by Professor Thomas Glass examined the impact of activities we might feel passionate about on longevity. The findings were dramatic. 'Social engagement was stronger than things like blood pressure, cholesterol, or other measures of health.' So do something for your health. Ask yourself what you feel strongly about. What would you like to do, change, make, become? 45)_____ Every one of us has an interest in something, but it often gets sidelined with the demands of daily life. We may come to view it as an indulgence, or worry we will be judged for it, particularly if the thing we love isn't something we're particularly good at. But passion doesn't necessarily mean being great at something. And what if you don’t know where your passion lies? 46)_____ Whatever you settle on, the main thing is to find something. Reawaken your passionate side and appreciate the passion in others. You’ll find life becomes more fulfilling and colourful. We may not be able to live every minute of every day passionately – that would probably be exhausting! But with a bit of thought and imagination, passion is something we can enjoy experiencing at least a little of every day. A. In fact, if you're not feeling passionate, there is evidence that acting as if you are can help! 'If you jump, throw a fist in the air and shout \"Yes!\", a feedback loop in your brain will interpret this behaviour as passionate and you'll get a surge of adrenaline,' she explains. 'People who are under-emotive can increase their pleasurable hormonal responses by behaving enthusiastically.' B. If you are not sure exactly what you want to explore, try tasters in subjects you're interested in first. Get a book about it, talk to someone who's done it, find a one-day workshop. Perhaps your passion could simply be trying new things? C. Passion can be as simple as teaching children to play football or getting up early in the morning to photograph a beautiful sunrise. it's not about doing something because you think you should or because it will make you money - it's about doing something you love as well as you can, purely for the love of it. D. Whether this particular example of passion is misplaced or not is another matter. it's about people standing up for something they really believed in. lt was their 'cause', even though few people agreed with their ideals. They were prepared to fight for what they wanted and risked everything in the process. E. it's fairly easy to identify passionate people in the public eye - most people at the top of their profession have needed a hefty amount to get them there. But there's a difference between pure passion and cold, calculating ruthlessness. True passion usually involves a positive gain directed outside ourselves - towards other people or nature. But what if you're struggling to muster enthusiasm for daily life, let alone to feel passionate about anything? F. Consider what you are doing when time seems to fly. What did you love as a child or teenager? Consider anything you've felt 'naturally' drawn towards. What activity never seems like work and always boosts your energy? G. According to international coach Anthony Robbins we each need to find the emotional force that drives us. 'The most important decision we make in life', says Robbins, 'is to focus on something that will get us inspired, excited, something that will move us, something that will ignite a spark.'"

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a new restaurant. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D . The reviews may be chosen more than once. Union Street Cafe Four critics comment on the restaurant A. If any among you still doubt that David Beckham is an exceedingly smart cookie, members of the jury, allow me to submit the clinching evidence. A few weeks ago, the Daily Mirror recently reported, he withdrew as an investor in his chum Gordon Ramsay's Union Street Cafe, which opened in Southwark on Monday. The Mirror did not explain why, revealing only that the two men 'wanted different things'. We could speculate for hours about what that means, but let me posit this theory: Beckham wanted a really good restaurant and Ramsay wanted something else. This is not to suggest he wanted a really bad restaurant. Eccentric as his psycho shtick may make him appear, he is not clinically insane, and this newbie, his I Oth in Britain, is far from atrocious. lt would be more endearing, or at least more memorable, if it were. What makes it so irksome is the so-what-ishness of this rather brand new restaurant. B. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to close my eyes, stick my fingers in my ears and pretend I don't know that this big, new, shiny restaurant in Southwark has anything to do with Gordon Ramsay. Otherwise, it's impossible to approach without being blind-sided by the baggage trailed in his wake. He's the tallest of poppies, our Gordon; everybody lining up to give him a trampling. So let's make believe that Union Street Cafe is brought to us by nice, anonymous people intent on giving us fine food and a good time. You in? This is Big Sweary's first opening without his eminence grise pa-in-law, with whom he fell out in spectacular, Greek tragedian fashion. Sorry, I'll try again. it's all cheery bustle in this high-windowed and handsome room, more New York than London, in its studied mix of haute-industrial and luxury: ducting and concrete, framing well-spaced tables and designer leather chairs. The open kitchen is set on high, pulpit-style; inside is chef Davide Degiovanni, formerly of the Four Seasons. it's a telling piece of recruitment: despite the warehouse disguise, this is not about the grunge. С. Union Street Cafe is not a cafe and isn't strictly in Union Street (see address below) but it's certainly the most talked-about and 'in' new restaurant for the autumn. This, you'll doubtless know, is because it was rumoured that its owner, Gordon Ramsay, the former footballer who once had a trial with Rangers, was going into partnership with David Beckham, the wel lknown foodie. Why this macho convergence would have made for an ideal restaurant, is hard to fathom. Have we got a picture in our heads of Victoria in a lace pinny, sulkily announcing the daily specials? No? Just me, then . But it doesn't matter now, because Beckham chose not to invest any dosh. So the USC is just a new Gordon Ramsay joint, in a funny part of town. Great Suffolk Street isn't hopelessly grotty, just a bit down-at-heel. lt, and Union Street which it bisects, are in the heart of Southwark, the raffish heart of Olde South London that's now so trendy, bounded by Tate Modern, Borough Market, Guy's Hospital and the London Dungeon. I think it appealed to Gordon because it's London's version of Brooklyn; edgy, but without the West End's gleam and swagger. And there's a famous Union Street in Brooklyn. D. David Beckham pulled out at the last minute, but that hasn't stopped a rush for tables at Gordon Ramsay's new venture; and the fact that Union Street Cafe is doing brisk trade, proves that Ramsay himself retains impressive pulling power. With its casual urban setting and emphasis on Italian cooking, this venue marks a welcome departure for the megastar chef, who has drafted in Davide Degiovanni to head up the kitchen . Expect small portions of accomplished, ingredients-led dishes, ranging from intensely flavoured tagliolini with rabbit and provolone, or lamb cutlets with baked fennel and onion, to Amaretto and chocolate budino, a deliriously rich, custardy dolce. Switched-on young staff in casual garb are a good fit for the restaurant's warehouse-chic theme and there are cocktai ls aplenty in the basement bar. 'I absolutely loved the whole package,' said one fan. Which reviewer: makes inferences to New York in their review when discussing the restaurant’s décor, like reviewer B? 37___ like reviewer A, suggests that the public might lack sympathy with Ramsay’s public persona? 38___ disagrees with the other three reviewers, believing Ramsay’s new restaurant to be not particularly fashionable? 39___ like reviewer C, believes that having a famous owner, has helped the popularity of the restaurant? 40___"

And before you reach for Jne of those mints sitting on the counter by the till, think 'YJW many non-hand-washers have dipped their fingers into :hat bowl. But the problem isn't restricted to grubby eateries. More than half of food poisoning infections are ntracted in the home.

But most food poisoning is pre- 'entable if you know what you're doing. 8 ext time you have a headache, don't automatically reach ;or the painkillers. Using them too often could be more jangerous than you think. For a vulnerable minority, the ·oute to addiction can be alarmingly fast. it's thought :hat overusing painkillers leads to changes in the way the Jfain handles pain signals, so it becomes oversensitive to s imuli that wouldn't normally cause pain. As the pain :hreshold lowers, people seek out stronger medication ::nd increase the dosage and soon they are hooked. Somewhere along the line we have become blase about e dangers of these medicines which are available in Jetrol stations, news agents and supermarkets. People 1ust not assume that over the counter drugs are safe Jecause clearly this is not the case. C. - he basic premise of detox is that we need to clear the toxic waste from our bodies every so often in order to stay healthy. lt sounds a reasonable idea, but nutrition experts are quick to point out that there's no evidence to support it. Detoxing is a concept that underestimates the abilities of our liver and kidneys. Any toxins that do get absorbed are very efficiently dealt with and secreted by our bodies. The concept of detox diets is irrational and unscientific. Those promoting detox diets often claim that in order to detoxify, we should avoid foods such as wheat and dairy products. The reality is that these foods pro- ;ide us with important nutrients, and it is unnecessary and potentially harmful to exclude them from the diet. D. There is a lot of publicity about the dangers of having 'high cholesterol' at the moment - mainly coming from companies that make special foods that claim to lower it for you. lt is a widespread problem though: according to the British Heart Foundation around two thirds of British people have a blood cholesterol level above the suggested healthy target figure. And as there are no symptoms until it causes disease, many people with high cholesterol may not be aware that they have it. However we need some cholesterol because the body wouldn't function without it! lt is a key part of cell membranes and it is also found in bile, which is important for digestion and absorption of fat. E. Just like a real-time personal trainer (PT), an online coach discusses personal goals, tailors exercise schedules and offers advice to clients of all abilities. Instead of face-toface guidance, however, the virtual trainer gives feedback via emails and texts - perfect for the self-concious exerciser! While critics say that it is impossible to effectively train clients without meeting them, online coaches offer a valuable compromise when it comes to training. First they are a cost-effective alternative. Second, they represent a more flexible option, especially if your work takes up much of your time or makes it difficult for you to commit to regular sessions. And just because your coach is in cyberspace, it doesn't mean he won't be keeping tabs on you. The mere thought of the next email should have you racing to put on your sports kit. F. Most of us are unclear as to where social drinking stops and alcohol dependency starts. A heavy-drinking student is fairly normal, but a 40-year-old party animal? A sozzled 60-year-old? At what point do the questions demand a serious answer? Recommendations from the government are that men should consume no more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women only two to three units. Of course, committed social drinkers of all ages often ignore units, taking comfort from the fact that they are not reaching for the bottle before lunchtime, and their friends are drinking as much as they are so it must be alright. But you can even test yourself online by looking at Alcohol Concern's website to determine if alarm bells should be ringing. Most people can reduce their alcohol consumption without professional help but it's not just about cutting down, it's about editing your life to remove the reasons you are drinking too much."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about exam technology. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. The Future of Exams Like it or not, technology is already an established part of the exam process and the only argument still to be fought at this year's e-assessment conference and exhibition, taking place in London this week, is just how much further in that direction we should go. At one end, little has changed. Students still, by and large, take exams in much the same way as they always have. They walk into a room full of desks with an invigilator on hand to tell them when to start and stop and to make sure no one is texting anyone else, and everyone is ticking the right boxes, or writing out the answer in longhand if required. it's once the ink has dried that the real change in the system kicks in. Instead of divvying up the scripts between the thousands of markers, they are now scanned into a central computer and the markers then access them online. The benefits are obvious. it's quicker, cheaper and more efficient. The really dull components, such as multiple choice or simple questions such as \"name four things that contribute to global warming\", can be marked automatically or by less experienced markers, whereas questions requiring a more nuanced, longer answer can be left to the old hands. Your best markers don't have to be wasted on the straightforward stuff. Students can also benefit. \"Markers can now give much more precise feedback\", says Kathleen T attersall, who chairs the Institute of Educational Assessors. \"We can tell someone almost exactly what he or she needs to do to improve a grade because we can show them what they got right and wrong. This is particularly useful for anyone looking to resit a January exam in the summer, because teachers can tailor individual revision plans for all their students.\" For all its advantages, no one reckons that this assessment model is the finished article. \"There are difficulties that need to be ironed out\", says Martin Walker, a former English teacher and a principal examiner for one of the main boards. \"Because markers are now often only given a few questions from each paper, it's hard to get an accurate feel of exactly what a student does and doesn't know. When you had an entire exam script in front of you, you could build up a picture of the candidate's range of knowledge, so when there was room for doubt in an answer you could make a judgement call based on previous responses. it's much harder to do that now.\" \"There are also limits to what you can easily read on screen\", he adds. \"In my experience, most examiners end up printing out the long essays and working from a hard copy, which is both time-consuming and slightly self-defeating.\" The danger, as Tattersall concedes, is that schools end up teaching only what technology is capable of assessing. \"Rather, we have to look at how IT is used in the classroom to improve teaching and learning and base our exams on that model\", she says. lt is certain that we are only halfway through the electronic revolution. In the coming years, more and more exams will be completed - as well as marked - online, and the government and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority will have to think hard about ways of maintaining standards. By far the easiest form of online testing to implement is multiple choice. A student can take the test online and it can be automatically marked instantaneously; this system is almost foolproof. The downside is that most people associate multiple choice with dumbing down, on the grounds that anything that can be reduced to a yes or no, right or wrong answer is bound to be over-simplified. \"Not true\", says Stevie Pattison-Dick, head of communications for Edexcel. \"Some multiple-choice exams may be quite straightforward, but if they are, they only reflect the level of knowledge a student is expected to attain. There's nothing inherently simple about multiple choice. We've become very sophisticated in our question setting and are able to cross-reference the answers, so an examiner can now tell whether someone just got lucky by ticking the right box or actually understood the process on which he or she was being assessed.\" One of the final exams a medical student has to pass before qualifying as a doctor is multiple choice, so this method of assessment has to be extremely rigorous. 31 The writer believes that A. nothing of significance has changed in the exam system. B. a revolution in exam taking may soon be initiated. C. many students cheat by using their mobile phones. D. technology doesn’t greatly affect students when they sit exams. 32 What does the writer mean by ‘old hands’ in paragraph 3?

A. better utilisation of examiners B. more interesting questions can be set C. many set questions do not need human markers at all D. financial advantages 34 What is stated to be a disadvantage of the current system? A. Many examiners complain that the work is boring now. B. Examiners no longer have enough work. C. Examiners have a limited impression of the candidate. D.

It’s impossible for a computer error to be made. 36 According to Stevie Patterson-Dick, multiple-choice exams A. do have a large element of chance in them.

    "text": "You are going to read an article about robotics. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. \"Robots to the rescue\". In the war on terror, University of South Florida engineering Professor Robin Murphy finds herself a pioneer on the front line with a new kind of soldier: the search-and-rescue robot. Strewn about are piles of broken concrete blocks and pipes, metal and dirt. Amid the rubble, a small black object looking like some futuristic toy tank rolls into view. It surveys the damage, edges forward, climbs over a mound of debris, then stops. Suddenly, the rubber treads shift from horizontal to vertical, raising the lens into a better vantage point to transmit images. The robot has done its job. 41)____________ She looks like an emergency worker ready for action: work boots, navy-blue trousers, white hardhat over her short brown hair. One moment, she's answering questions from scientists. The next, she's racing to another robot demonstration, always keeping the program moving. In a larger sense, that's what Murphy does best – she keeps the relatively new field of robotics and rescue moving forward. January’s \"Discover\" magazine honoured Murphy in its \"Top 100 Science Stories of 2002\" edition. 42)____________ Murphy, at 46, is in demand these days. When she's not teaching at USF, she's travelling the country giving presentations, serving as a co-chair on various committees, or coordinating with the Department of Defence. Murphy is hardly the stiff scientist one might expect from a robotologist. She is disarmingly casual in conversation. Yet she is also intense, pushing herself and the people around her. What separates Murphy from her colleagues is that many of them don't get out into the field. But that's where she thrives, and where she gets the knowledge to make her robots successful. 43)____________ \"Imagine the scenario where something green is hanging over the city and you don't know what it is and or where it’s coming from,\" she says. \"These guys can roll in, and throw a robot off the back of a truck to carry all the gas meters and detectors. Then, the rescuers are able to figure out what safety precautions to take. The robots will help the rescuers make the right decisions.\" 44)____________ \"Later, her work began to gain attention when she was a professor at the Colorado School of Mines, where she taught before going to USF six years ago. There, her ideas impressed Rita Virginia Rodriguez of the National Science Foundation. Rodriguez began funding Murphy’s work in Colorado, and continues to do so at USF. \"Robin is one of the most important people in this movement,\" says Rodriguez. \"She’s one of the engineers who is very good, very forward-thinking. What we’ve seen today is the first workshop of its kind and it is all her initiative.\" 45)____________ The birth of robot-assisted search and rescue began with one of the nation’s worst disasters: the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. One of Murphy’s graduate students, was appalled at the large, clumsy robots that sat unused in a car park. Bitton soon helped create a Defence Department programme to build small, mobile robots for battlefield applications. At the same time, Murphy and her students began focusing on software: how to control robots, how to integrate them with a computer. When 9/11 occurred, Murphy was there immediately. Yet her team was not accepted right away. 46)____________ The work never ends. Murphy says, \"I just want to be of use. Look at what the guys in fire and rescue service have to do. The technology is there to help them, and it’s up to scientists to provide the right technology to fit to the right people at the right time.\". A. Her father was a mechanical engineer, so it was in the family. As a child she immersed herself in science fiction: \"I never really identified with the heroes\" she says. \"I always thought the scientists who built things for these guys were far more interesting.\" She earned her Master's degree in computer science at Georgia Tech., won a fellowship and worked for a professor with expertise in artificial intelligence and within two months, she was on her way to her Ph.D. B. At first, the USF contingent had trouble getting through the police lines. \"The fire and rescue teams were a bit suspicious, because when they think of robots, they think of big explosive ordnance devices,\" she says. But eventually they were able to get close enough to help, and the smaller robots proved remarkably effective. Murphy has moved at an intense pace ever since, working to become even more effective in the event of another terrorist attack. C. Applause fills the breezy morning air. Some 50 scientists are impressed by the brief demonstration of the VGTV, Variable Geometry Tracked Vehicle. They have come from universities, industry, the military and countries as far away as Japan, Sweden, Italy and England. They have left their classrooms, computers and academic theory behind to get their hands a little dirty: to see an array of search-and-rescue robots perform in simulated conditions. And they are all here because. of Professor Robin Murphy. D. Murphy and her students don't actually build the robots. What they do, in essence, is take models made by companies and create the software programmes to adapt them to search and rescue. The little VGTV that performed so effectively in the rubble of the twin towers collapse had been built to explore air-conditioning ducts. They gave it a new brain and figured out ways to transport it in a backpack and deploy it at a moment's notice. E. However, there are still many problems with the whole project. Funding is the main one. Murphy often struggles to gain funding from the usual channels due to her lack of an academic background which tends to put off a lot of potential sponsors. They seem to ignore the fact that her achievements have more than made up for any official qualifications that she may be missing. lt remains to be seen if this will, in the end, be the cause of the demise of her work. F. The workshop is full of innovations. Nearby, a team from the University of Minnesota displays its robot named Scout - a tiny tube with two wheels and an antenna. One of the inventors picks Scout up and tosses it on the pavement. No problem. lt keeps rolling. \"People are starting to see what robots can do\", Murphy says. \"One thing we're trying to do is help rescue workers learn what's possible.\" G. She was featured for her advances with rescue robots, in particular the work she and several graduate students performed at the World Trade Centre. With a cadre of robots packed in the back of her husband's van, they arrived on September 12 2001 and stayed for eleven days. A handful of the small VGTV robots squeezed deep into the collapse, helped identify five victims, and transmitted many detailed videos and photos. \"But\", she says, \"we weren't in Discover just because we were at the World Trade Centre. it's what we've done since.\" "

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a rock concert. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Radiohead Four critics comment on a live show A. \"IT'S RADIOHEAD NIGHT!\" shouts the menu poster outside the bar'n'grill just inside the 02 Arena's doors. At first you just roll your eyes at the crater-sized disconnect between knee-jerk corporate food marketing and the ethos of the band whose name is being taken in vain , in block caps. Even when Radiohead were a conventional outfit, singing grunge-pop ditties such as Creep, their image was that of haughty refuseniks, not shirtless Lotharios lairily gnawing buffalo wings. Thom Yorke had publicly aligned his band with the aesthetically disaffected, the creeps and the weirdos. Twenty years on, Radiohead remain one of the biggest bands in the world, one uncommonly in control of their own destiny. They are label-less and immune to corporate pressure. The last laugh is very much theirs. There is no little heroism in the fact that the Oxfordshire five-piece can come to giant sheds like these and sell them out with their jazz-tinged electronic rock, sung in falsetto by a nervy mendicant type sporting a beard and a top-knot. B. it's a decade and a half since OK Computer catapulted Radiohead to global superstardom. They've now been one of the biggest bands in the world for so long that it's easy to forget how curious and unique their situation is: in a world where rock and pop is not much given to overestimating its audience, here is a band whose music long ago abandoned any pretensions to commerciality capable of filling out the kind of venues where Rihanna or Coldplay normally ply their trade. Anyone requiring a reminder of the incongruity of Radiohead's position, needs only to step inside the 02 arena. Jauntily yellow-jacketed stewards are flogging soft toys, emblazoned with the words VAMPIRES SUCK MY BLOOD in gothic script. In one of the 02's numerous chain restaurants, menus announce that it's Radiohead Night; quite how the dread-filled, agitated sound found on their last album, King Of Limbs, squares with bourbon-glazed baby back ribs and the Cajun spiced chicken sandwich, remains open to question, but you can't blame them for trying. С. \"Hello. My name's Lady Gaga.\" Thom Yorke's introduction to Radiohead's first British audience in four years, was happily and tellingly unpredictable. Saturday's sell-out show at 02 Arena, one of only three UK dates following a more substantial swing across the US, served as delayed support for another creative left turn in the form of 20 I l's The King of Limbs. That album dispensed with the more conventional textures of its predecessor, In Rainbows. In came a new fascination with samples and programming, leading to a hyper-physical kind of electronica that Yorke likened to the wildness of nature. He certainly had a point. There's a tendency to over-rationalise the music of Radiohead, but this gig proved that the Oxford five-piece band are more than capable of delivering on a gut level. Separator, for example, was an impressionistic space ballad given real heft by punishing dance beats, while the riot of grooves that shunted Feral out into drill'n'bass territory, was symptomatic of their entire approach. D. By rights, Radiohead should have been here to relive the good old days. 1998 was the height of the British art-rock outfit's third album, OK Computer, making them a very big deal indeed. Their heyday alas is now long gone. However, that magnum opus, OK Computer, still casts a long and glorious shadow over their career and in fan memories -as was witnessed to the response to two of its tracks, Airbag, up early, and the symphonic Paranoid Android, last song in the first encore, by the sold-out 02 arena crowd. But this wasn't a greatest hits show. lt wasn't even pushing their recent offering, 20 I l's King of Limbs, too much, with maybe half a dozen tracks in the two-hour twoencore show. Which might have left many present a bit non-plussed at no dusting off of breakthrough hit Creep, or anything off second big-chorus anthemic album The Bends. WHICH REVIEWER: uses the food vendors at the O2 arena, like reviewer A, to illustrate a point about the band’s attitude towards money? 37____., conveys the idea that people may over-analyse the music of Radiohead? 38____., disagrees with the other three reviewers, in believing that Radiohead have had their day? 39____., like reviewer A, suggests that Radiohead avoid being a mainstream pop band? 40____"

The story of someone growing up.________ 54. This book has been written perfectly for its target reader.________ 55. Someone keeps remembering things in his/her past.________. 56 Two eras existing at the same time.________. A. Gifts - Ursula Le Guin. Gifts is a coming-of-age story, intended, at a guess, as a book for young teenagers, and as such has to be written with scrupulous care. In this respect it is exemplary. Tightly-plotted, there isn't a word out of place. Quintessential Le Guin, in fact. This book is set on a world which might be Earth but could just as easily not be, in what is almost a default fantasy land, with a scrape-an-agricultural-living uplands, the main narrative. The book is not quite a Wizard of Earthsea but it gets very close and as is usual with Le Guin's work, Gifts, despite its quota of disputes, conflict and death, is a life-affirming experience, well worth reading by adults of all ages. B. Soul Purpose - Nick Marsh. It shouldn't happen to a vet. Alan Reece, human wreck, is called out one night in late December to tend to a pregnant cow, but the calf is born transparent. This is but the first in a global outbreak of transparent births, and Alan finds himself at the centre of the oncoming apocalypse. Actually this book reminds me not a little of that book about exploding sheep from a few years ago. It's not a very bad book, it's just not a brilliant book either. The prologue is terrible; the epilogue is surprisingly good; in between it averages out. This isn't the first metaphysical comedy adventure book I've read this year, so possibly it's arrived at the right time to take advantage of a trend of some sort. However, \"memorable\" and \"original\" are two words I can't, in all sincerity, use to describe it. C. The Space Eater - D. Langford. Wormhole travel is possible but only up to a diameter of 1.9 cm. Through one such spyhole, the government discovers that a distant colony world is developing weaponry based on Anomalous Physics which could endanger whole star systems. Send in the marines! Oh no, wait, they don't make 19 cm tall Marines. Enter Ken Jacklin, one of a team of soldiers trained to charge headlong into death and be grown back in regeneration tanks, even when blown to a pulp. Accompanying him is Rossa Corman, a woman who can send messages coded in pain back to Earth by jabbing herself in the arm. The premise that someone can be remade - body and mind - from jam hours after their death is a little hard to swallow, but in general it's very hard to fault this novel. The characters are rounded and engaging, the story is lively and well told with intrigue aplenty, and the science, however out there it may be, is explained in accessible and thought-provoking terms. A very rewarding read. D. Babylon - Richard Calder. Babylon has a lush feel to it. Calder writes erudite and richly detailed prose which situates the characters first in the Victorian London of Jack the Ripper and later in the crumbling metropolis of a modern Babylon existing in a parallel dimension. The book is strong on atmosphere and there are some marvellously melodramatic set pieces in which major plot shifts are played out. I get the impression that Calder knows his material and wants the reader to be able to visualise his world clearly but this enthusiasm for detail is also one of the novel's drawbacks. The pages are cluttered with facts and at one point I began to feel some sympathy with the character who shouts out that she doesn't know anything. Whilst the book jacket promises blood and gore and there are intimations of ravishment scattered throughout the first part of the novel, the second and third parts deliver little of either and the melodramatic quality of the set pieces seems increasingly at odds with the cerebral working out of the novel's conclusion. E. Against Gravity - Gary Gibson. In 2088, following a terrorist nuclear strike on Los Angeles, America’s political dissidents are rounded up and sent to the Maze, a top secret research facility, to provide experimental hosts for military nanotech. This is a densely packed Science Fiction thriller, and for all the twists and action the pace felt quite sedate to me. I think it might be all the flashbacks – Gallon is the only viewpoint character, and his story is intercut with lengthy scenes of his time in the Maze, which he has escaped from. This material is well depicted, particularly the gruesome failed experiments and the survival-of-the-fittest tests. Against Gravity is a good futuristic action novel, but the tagline “Live long enough and this could be your future” on the front cover tells me Gibson intends this novel first and foremost as a comment on the world we live in today. F. The New World Order - B. Jeapes. In Ben Jeapes' latest novel invaders arrive on Earth to find the locals already at war; with their superior technology, the invaders hammer both sides indiscriminately but end up uniting the humans against them. Except that these invaders not only come armed with machine guns and airships but also with witchcraft, their special wise cadre tapping the Earth's ley energy. This is a lively and intelligent novel from Ben Jeapes. A section at the end caps the story with historical notes and a revelation that you may guess before, but which you should still find entertaining."

PARKING HELL: THE PARKING INDUSTRY INVESTIGATED Local authorities in England and Wales now make more than £1 billion from the parking business. Yet there are growing accusations of sharp practice, and all over the country motorists are gearing up for battle. Wednesday, 3.20pm: David Nicknam, a North London parking attendant until last May, shuffles nervously down Hampstead High Street explaining the \"tricks\" he says he was taught here for issuing what he nonchalantly calls \"dodgy tickets\". \"I was told to give tickets no matter how legally a car was parked,\" Nicknam says with a disapproving frown, his greying ponytail and wispy beard incongruous among the impeccably groomed ladies strolling up the hill. \"If a driver's got a disabled badge, you write that there's no badge. If there's a visitor's permit, sometimes you ignore it - it's a question of 'Who's going to believe the driver?' And if you ask me if you can park for five minutes to collect someone, I'd be expected to say OK - and then ticket you once you've gone. He doesn't have your name, the thinking goes, so what's he going to do?\" Nicknam, 39, was taking home £226.79 for a 42-hour week when he says he was sacked after three months' probation. The reason, he says, is that he found grounds to ticket only five or six cars \"legally\" in a typical day, rather than the ten or more he says his superiors expected. \"If I wanted to survive, to get a permanent job, I was told I'd have to bring in at least ten tickets no matter how,\" he says with ill-disguised contempt. The scams, he says, ranged from falsely claiming that bays had been suspended to hand-issuing deliberately mistimed tickets after claiming his computer was down. \"I told them, I can't do that. I said I believed in God. I asked my supervisors, 'How do you sleep? Do you lie there dreaming about ticketing cars all night'?\" Camden council rejects his allegations, and, as a clearly disaffected former employee of the council's parking contractor, Nicknam is by no means neutral. He readily accepts that he bears grudges against NCP, whose management, he says, refused to hear his complaints and promoted supervisors who openly broke the rules. Yet his claims – of attendants falsifying observation times, issuing \"ghost\" tickets when cars were not present, dishonestly claiming tyres were outside parking bays – have all been made by other London parking attendants (PAs) in recent months. At stake is public confidence in the entire system of parking enforcement. \"You have to ask why drivers hate the PAs,\" Nicknam reflects as he crosses into Prince Arthur Road, a favourite spot, he explains, for colleagues to hide before pouncing on cars left for three minutes at school pick-up time. \"How many people have spoken out before me? You have to ask why the council doesn't want PAs to help the drivers. You might call it cheating, but I call it stealing.\" He shakes his head and whispers disapprovingly. \"It's money, isn't it? Money talks.\" Council coffers are swelling not simply through parking tickets and bus-lane fines, but also from meter feeds and the sale of permits. Yet by any standards, the business of ticketing, clamping and removing cars is booming as never before. The London boroughs issued almost seven million penalty charge notices in last year, up from 5.4 million in three years ago. Outside London, English and Welsh councils handed out almost three million more. By law, local authorities must regulate parking not primarily to raise money, but \"to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic\". Yet as the surpluses have risen over the years, so have public suspicions about the councils' true agenda. As Brian King, director of the RAC Foundation, sees it, local authorities now see parking as \"a convenient and easy way to raise money, rather than as a policy issue\". Public tolerance is being tested with every television investigation alleging corruption, and with each outraged report of target-fixated attendants ticketing buses, fire engines, even a rabbit-hutch whose owner, delivering to a Manchester pet shop, moved his van before a warden could pounce. \"It's the biggest fraud that goes on,\" claims Jim Carlson, a Pimlico accountant who runs Appeal.com, one of a growing number of websites campaigning against what they see as unjust use of parking regulations to make money. Carlson has heard it all: PAs falsifying information in their notebooks to \"prove\" that correctly parked cars were elsewhere; motorists illegally ticketed long after they had driven off. He makes an annual award to the victim of what he considers the most absurd abuse of a PA's powers. Its latest winner was Nadhim Zahawi, who was handed a penalty charge notice in central London as he lay in the road with a broken leg after coming off his scooter. \"The councils are very happy to allow a poor system to continue, because they get the revenue,\" Carlson says wearily. \"Nobody now has faith in the system. I certainly don't.\" 31 It is claimed in the article that 'dodgy tickets' are B. unfairly given to legally parked cars. 32 Nicknam was fired C. for not giving out enough tickets. 33 Nicknam's reasons for disobeying his employer are A. moral. 34 Multiple claims of dishonest ticketing are B. making people distrustful of the parking system. 35 The business of ticketing, clamping and removing cars is C. making more money than in the past. 36 The conclusion of the article is B. pessimistic."

Death in Malta Rosanne Dingli. Gregory had the old doctor at his heels, and could hear a slight wheezing coming from the man’s chest. He looked sprightly this morning, with hair well slicked back as usual and sharp creases in his trousers. 41_____ ‘Like this,’ the doctor interrupted. ‘Like we did the first time.’ He was already wrestling the knife back and forth forcibly, trying to edge it underneath the wax seal. The effort gave no result. The wax seemed to have hardened, fused into the porous clay surface of the jar neck. ‘Like this!’ the older man repeated, words coming out in a grunt through clenched teeth. Gregory gently took the knife from his hand when he looked up, sweat standing out in beads on his forehead. Gregory tried himself, levering the blade at a different angle, cautiously forcing it with both hands. 42_____ It was the doctor. He brushed past Gregory to grab the mallet abruptly. His audible breathing filled the cellar, his arm waving, gesturing with the mallet. Almost immediately, Gregory was by his side, but it was already too late. With one massive lunge, he swung the mallet round sideways at waist level, bringing its impact to the broadest curve on the bombul’s side. 43_____ Patricia stood immobile, the expression on her face frozen. ‘What on earth did you do that for?’ she muttered. Gregory watched the doctor squeeze his head between his hands, then turn, looking for something. He looked at the broken pieces of clay at his feet, appearing started to see them and the vinegar that pooled on the ground and drenched his trouser legs and shoes. ‘It’s blood,’ he said, seemingly unaware of anyone else around him. Then he took off in a lop-sided run, out of the cellar door, up the stone steps and away from where the others stood. 44_____ ‘We all waited a week for this,’ Patricia gestured, indicating the wreckage about their feet. ‘He seemed to check there was nothing there, on the floor, before he left,’ she continued, baffled. ‘He said blood. Why did he say that?’ ‘Oh – I don’t know,’ answered Gregory, resigned to the mystery. ‘All our eyes were on the jar. We were all looking to see if there was anything there. Well there isn’t. All there is is vinegar. Just vinegar.’ Patricia started to flick ineffectually at her jeans. 45_____ He had fully expected to see a sodden bundle of clothes and flesh, a little parcel; the remnants of a life, virtually pickled in rancid wine. He had laid awake at night picturing what they would see inside the emptied bombul; grey fabric in colourless tatters preserved by the wine; grey skin angled over bone; the skull rounded and turned forward, over a small caved-in chest. He was surprised it was not there. 46_____ How could she possibly know? He turned to look at her, perplexed, a touch annoyed. He was still not completely accustomed to the way she would never chastise him for having feelings or imaginings, for pre-empting things, for having a totally separate world in his head. He was silent for a long time, allowing her the closeness. ‘But there’s nothing there,’ he said finally. ‘Nothing there,’ she repeated. A. \"Blood?\" Patricia looked at Gregory. \"Why did he say that? Why did he smash the jar?\" Her face was a picture of incredulity. \"I don't know. What a mess,\" said Gregory blankly. \"It was as if he couldn't bear to wait any longer.\" B. Patricia was calm, almost purring like a cat in the sun. Her eyes were bright and she anticipated the work in the cellar with cheery eagerness. The three entered the large room, intent on getting the bombul open. Patricia handed a knife to the doctor. \"I wonder whether this clay jar is full of oil or wine.\" \"Or water,\" answered the old doctor. He turned a bit pale, the heat making his top lip glisten only seconds after he returned his handkerchief to his pocket. \"Now,\" started Gregory, \"If we ...\" C. \"You had imagined it...\" Patricia did not finish. She looked at his eyes. Gregory raised a hand and shielded his eyes from her. She knew him too well, too soon. His feet had still not moved from the puddle of dark vinegar. \"I - yes,\" he said finally, accepting the scrutiny. \"I imagined more than just the words, you see,\" he said softly. She came round to him and touched his arm. \"I know.\" D. Gregory couldn't tell whether she was disappointed or glad they had not discovered anything more gruesome than several litres of acetic wine. He realised he did not initially register surprise at finding nothing in the liquid. But he was surprised. E. The jar smashed, a cry from Patricia accompanying the crashing sound made by the fragments of earthenware and the sudden copious flow of vinegar that splashed out, soaking the three of them from the knees down. As if in slow motion, the Doctor wheeled around on his heels, raising his hands to his head, the mallet falling with hardly a sound to the ground. His face was ashen, his teeth gritted underneath stretched lips. F. Patricia looked at the doctor with a childish glee. The contents that had spilled so tumultuously out onto the floor was everything they had been hoping for. Yet, it was also everything the writer had dreaded. Gregory looked at the other two with a desperate suspicion. \"Why?\" Patricia and the Doctor looked at each other for an answer that would appease their friend. G. \"Shall I try the other side, opposite to you, with another knife?\" asked Patricia. She sensed the doctor's impatience, and was now full of it herself. But Gregory had managed to insert the point of his knife under the wax rim. It was going to require precise movements. Patricia looked as if she was thinking of some other method to remove the wax plug from the jar mouth. Gregory looked at her as she gripped the earthenware rim thoughtfully. Then out of the corner of his eye, a sudden movement made him straighten."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a musical. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Billy Elliot Four critics comment on the musical theatre production A. T his is not a time to beat about the bush. Billy Elliot strikes me as the greatest British musical I have ever seen and I have not forgotten Lionel Bart's 0/iver! or Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. There is a rawness, a warm humour and a sheer humanity here that are worlds removed from the soulless slickness of most musicals. Yes, there are rough edges that w ould give Cameron Mackintosh a fit of the vapours, yes , there are occasional scenes that are not as powerful ly played as those in the film. But there is so much more that is big and bold, imaginative and great-hearted. Once upon a time, they used to make films out of stage musicals, but these days the traffic is all the other way. Following The Producers, Mary Pop pins and Spama/ot, comes this stage version of Stephen Daldry's beautiful and moving Brit flick about an I 1-year-old boy from a coal-mining village in County Durham, who is determined to become a ballet dancer. B. Turn ing small-scale movies into big musicals is a treacherous business. lt failed with The Full Monty , w hich lost all of its gritty truth when musicalised. But Billy Elliot succeeds brilliantly because Elton John's music and, especially, Peter Darling's choreography enhance Lee Hall's cinematic concept. The musical, even more than the film, counterpoints Billy's personal triumph with the community's decline. Eleven-yearold Billy is an Easington miner's son who overcomes family bigotry and financial hardship to make it to the Royal Ballet School. But a show that begins with grai ny newsreel footage celebrating the nationalisation of the coal industry ends with the collapse of the 1984 miners' strike. Billy's aspirations have been realised, but a local community faces ruin. lt is the tension between those two facts that gives the musical its drive. But, even more significantly, dance is used to express narrative in a way that evokes West Side Story. You see this early on in an extraordinary sequence where the choreographed conflict between the miners and police invades Mrs Wilkinson's dance academy, filled with little girls in tutus. The effect is both comic and tragic, in that it suggests no aspect of Easington life is untouched by a savage industrial dispute. : С. Not since Blood Brothers first opened in 1983, has there been a new British musical to combine social commentary with a heartfelt story of adolescence, as powerfully and melodically as Billy Elliot . Adapted for the stage from the hit film of 2000 by its original director Stephen Daldry, screenwriter Lee Hall and choreographer Peter Darling, who are newly joined by composer Elton John, the material has been deepened and given a vibrant immediacy that can only come from the dynamics of live performance. And the rites-of-passage journey the show charts - of an I 1-year-old boy transcending his working class background to gain admittance to the Royal Ballet School - is played out against the background of the 1984 Miners' Strike, implying the fierceness of Billy's own struggle. D. Together, Stephen Daldry and Lee Hall have concocted a piece that's tougher, bolder and, as my tear-ducts can attest, no matter how hard I tried to disguise it, more moving than its admittedly admirable celluloid precursor. With its rags-to-riches, or rather povertyto-pirouette, story, the piece invites sentimentality. But that's almost entirely missing in the Geordie pit village where young Billy discovers he has a gift for dance. Billy not only has to struggle against a society that could not understand a young boy wanting to enter the world of ballet, but he also, to a certain extent, is forced to turn his back on the traditional job of mining that his father and grandfather before him had endured. Not only is his physical strength pushed to the limits with the demanding training and practice sessions that ballet requires, he also has to harden himself to a path that is without doubt going to be a very lonely one. Against all odds he reaches for the stars and eventually manages to fly. WHICH REVIEWER: 37 unlike the other three, does not compare the musical to previous musicals in the West End?_____ 38 highlights the importance of the economic backdrop from which the musical is set, like reviewer C?_____ 39 like reviewer B, refers to a historical event that serves to accentuate Billy's success?_____ 40 disagrees with the other three reviewers, in finding certain aspects of the film better than the musical?_____"

    "text": "You are going to read an article containing film reviews. For questions 47–56, choose from the reviews (A–F). The reviews may be chosen more than once. IN WHICH FILM REVIEW IS THE FOLLOWING MENTIONED? 47) An actor didn’t win despite performing well. __________ 48) A character plans to kill the leader of a country. __________ 49) Is full of feeling but not successful as a film or DVD. __________ 50) The plot spans over many years. __________ 51) The director of the movie was born in a foreign country. __________ 52) The writers were trying not to dully depict history. __________ 53) The director sees elements of their own life in the film. __________ 54) It is only ideal for a specific group of people. __________ 55) The prospect of violence was exciting. __________ 56) A lot of people die in the film. __________. A. Keira Knightley gives \"her best performance yet\" in Joe Wright’s adaptation of the Jane Austen classic Pride & Prejudice. It snagged her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Actress although she was eventually beaten to the globe by Reese Witherspoon for Walk the Line. Nonetheless this period romance went down well on both sides of the pond. While Austen’s work derives much of its tension from the buttoned-down customs of 18th century society, Matthew Macfadyen, who plays Mr Darcy, finds it all \"quite releasing\". Naturally the cast offers their interpretations although these tend towards the obvious; \"Elizabeth is very human,\" says Keira. She hits closer to the mark in a separate tribute to the novelist, saying, \"She puts across this absolutely gorgeous fairy tale in a rather realistic way.\" B. After endless TV runs of Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson has proved that he’s an inspired physical comedian. His second big screen outing as the tweed-donning doofus was generally better received than the first Bean flick, trading on slapstick shtick rather than fart gags as he travels all over France. The film also did brisk business at home and abroad, raising sacks of cash for Comic Relief. Cameras follow Bean and company on location across the sun-drenched South of France in French Beans. Director Steve Bendelack confesses he’s having a lot of \"fun\", while poor old Atkinson works up a sweat madly cycling after a chicken in a complex chase sequence. While critics talk about Atkinson’s \"effortless\" ability to make people laugh, the man himself doesn’t see it that way, saying that having to carry a film with so much physicality is \"quite stressful\". Obviously this DVD is very much a love it or hate it proposition, but for fans of the TV series, it’s the perfect escape on a wet afternoon. C. Three years after Super Size Me, director Richard Linklater put the burger business through the mincer again. It’s just a shame that Fast Food Nation is slathered in self-importance as it takes the point-of-view of various people affected by the contamination of meat at a Texan processing plant. After opening to mixed reviews, the box office numbers were as flat as a cheap beef patty. He admits that, going into the project, he knew very little about the politics of fast food and even dares to confess, \"I eat meat.\" Oh, and by the way, the meat is also a metaphor for the plight of illegal immigrants. Referring to the character played by Catalina Sandino Moreno, he says, \"It’s about her being turned into a piece of meat.\" Bet you didn’t see that coming, eh? Without question this film is full of heart, unfortunately the mishmash of storylines and speechifying doesn’t go down any easier on the small screen. D. Yes, there is a high body count and a lot of stuff gets blown up but Shooter was not an entirely mindless film. In it, a world-weary ex-Marine sniper gets drawn into a plot to assassinate the US president. Maybe it was this hackneyed premise that meant it fell slightly below target at the box office. Stephen Hunter, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, talks about the inspiration for the story in Survival Of The Fittest. He calls his leading character Bob Lee Swagger \"a Faustian intellectual of war,\" which might be slightly overstating it. Co-star Michael Pepa was apparently thrilled at the chance to shoot people. \"It’s really hard not to get into it,\" he says, later adding, \"The explosions were really neat.\" Somehow we don’t think he quite understood Hunter’s intentions… E. Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair drew on her own experiences for this poignant family saga The Namesake. Adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel about the pains of immigration, it stars Bollywood actress Tabu and erstwhile movie stoner Kal ‘Kumar’ Penn. Although the film didn’t break any box office records, glowing reviews helped to put bums on seats in all corners of the globe. Throughout the film, Nair picks on scenes that resonate with her own experiences of coming to America and raising children there, but she is also very instructive on the technical aspects of filmmaking. She explains why she chooses a close-up over a wide-angle shot and how that decision feeds the underlying emotion of a scene. Aspiring filmmakers will glean lots of practical advice, and for the average film fan, you’ll be transported across continents from the comfort of your own sofa. F. A period political drama is never an easy sell at the box office. Take the example of Amazing Grace, starring Ioan Gruffudd as bewigged human rights activist William Wilberforce. For director Michael Apted the challenge was in trying to show \"how heroic politics can be\", while trying to avoid a dry historical re-enactment of Wilberforce’s life, and instead put the focus on the battle between young revolutionaries and a fusty establishment. About his preparations for the role Gruffudd says that, as well as reading up on British/African history, there was the matter of how to age convincingly on screen. The young actor light-heartedly assures us that lots of makeup was involved because making him look old is \"very hard to do…\". Despite the weighty themes it deals with, the surprise is that, overall, this DVD isn’t as heavy as you’d think."

You don't have to be a biologist or an anthropologist to see how closely the great apes - gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans - resemble us. Even a child can see that their bodies are pretty much the same as ours, apart from some exaggerated proportions and extra body hair. Apes have dexterous hands much like ours but unlike those of any other creature. And, most striking of all, their faces are uncannily expressive, showing a range of emotions that are eerily familiar. That's why we delight in seeing chimps wearing tuxedos, playing the drums or riding bicycles. it's why a potbellied gorilla scratching itself in the zoo reminds us of Uncle Ralph or Cousin Vinnie; and why, in a more unsettled reaction, Queen Victoria, on seeing an orangutan named Jenny at the London Zoo in 1842, declared the beast \"frightful and painfully and disagreeably human.\" lt isn't just a superficial resemblance. Chimps, especially, not only look like us, they also share with us some human-like behaviours. They make and use tools and teach those skills to their offspring. They prey on other animals and occasionally murder each other. They have complex social hierarchies and some aspects of what anthropologists consider culture. They can't form words, but they can learn to communicate via sign language and symbols and to perform complex cognitive tasks. Scientists figured out decades ago that chimps are our nearest evolutionary cousins, roughly 98% to 99% identical to humans at the genetic level. When it comes to DNA, a human is closer to a chimp than a mouse is to a rat. Yet tiny differences, sprinkled throughout the genome, have made all the difference. Agriculture, language, art, music, technology and philosophy - all the achievements that make us profoundly different from chimpanzees and make a chimp in a business suit seem so deeply ridiculous - are somehow encoded within minute fractions of our genetic code. Nobody yet knows precisely where they are or how they work, but somewhere in the nuclei of our cells are handfuls of amino acids, arranged in a specific order, that endow us with the brainpower to outthink and outdo our closest relatives on the tree of life. They give us the ability to speak and write and read, to compose symphonies, paint masterpieces and delve into the molecular biology that makes us what we are. Until recently, there was no way to unravel these crucial differences. Exactly what gives us advantages like complex brains and the ability to walk upright, and certain disadvantages, including susceptibility to a particular type of malaria, AIDS and Alzheimer's, diseases that don't seem to afflict chimps, remained a mystery. But that's rapidly changing. Just a year ago, geneticists announced that they had sequenced a rough draft of the chimpanzee genome, allowing the first side-by-side comparisons of human and chimpanzee DNA. Already, that research has led to important discoveries about the development of the human brain over the past few million years and possibly about our ancestors' mating behaviour as well. And sometime in the next few weeks, a team led by molecular geneticist Svante Pobo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, will announce an even more stunning achievement: the sequencing of a significant fraction of the genome of Neanderthals - the human-like species we picture when we hear the word caveman - who are far closer to us genetically than chimps are. And though Neanderthals became extinct tens of thousands of years ago, Pobo is convinced he's on the way to reconstructing the entire genome of that longlost relative, using DNA extracted, against all odds, from a 38,000-year-old bone. Laid side by side, these three sets of genetic blueprints - plus the genomes of gorillas and other primates, which are already well on the way to being completely sequenced - will not only begin to explain precisely what makes us human but could lead to a better understanding of human diseases and how to treat them. 31 What is something apes do NOT do that humans do?

Robots to the rescue. Ten years old, he moved with his father across the curved polished floor of the freight bay, their booted feet squeaking on the high-gloss surface; the two of them suspended above their own dark reflections; a man and a boy forever walking up what looked to the eye like an ever steepening hill, but which always felt perfectly level. \"We're going outside, aren't we,\" Sky said. Titus looked down at his son. \"Why do you assume that?\" \"You wouldn't have brought me here otherwise.\" 41)_____ Now however – in a mood of eager forgiveness – he pushed such thoughts from his mind; awed by the sheer size of the freight bay and the prospect of what lay ahead. What made the place seem all the larger was the fact that the two of them were quite alone. The rest of the chamber was suggested rather than clearly seen; its dimensions only hinted at by the dark. 42)_____ After what seemed like days, the adults had made the main lights come on again. He noticed the air-circulators began to work again. All that time, his father told him later, they had been breathing unrecirculated air; slowly turning staler and staler as the hundred and fifty waking humans dumped more and more carbon dioxide back into their atmosphere. It soon would have started causing serious problems, but the air became fresher and the ship slowly warmed back up until it was possible to move along the corridors without shivering. The food improved, but Sky had hardly noticed that they had been eating emergency rations during the black-out. 43)_____ Titus halted near one of the small shuttles. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we're going outside. I think it's time you saw things the way they really are.\" \"What things?\" But by way of answer Titus only elevated the cuff of his uniform and spoke quietly into his bracelet. \"Enable excursion vehicle 15.\" 44)_____ Sky hopped into the spacecraft, feeling the floor vibrating beneath his feet. The taxi was considerably more cramped inside than it had appeared it would be – the hull thickly plated and armoured – and he had to duck to reach his seat, brushing his head against a gristle-like tangle of internal pipework. He fiddled with the blue-steel buckle until he had it tight across his chest. In front of him was a cool turquoise green display – constantly changing numbers and intricate diagrams. 45)_____ \"Word of advice, Sky. Never trust these damned things to tell you that they're safe. Make sure for yourself.\" \"You don't trust machines to tell you?\" 46)_____ \"What happened to change your mind?\" \"You'll see, shortly.\". A. Parked here and there were various spacecraft. The taxis could enter the atmosphere in an emergency, but they were not designed to make the return trip to space. The delta-winged landers which would make multiple journeys down to the surface of Journey's End were too large to store inside the Santiago; they were attached instead to the outside of the ship and there was almost no way to see them unless you worked on one of the external work crews, as his mother had done before her death. B. There was no hesitation; no questioning his authority. The taxi answered him instantly, lights flicking on; cockpit door craning open. Steam was beginning to vent from ports spaced along the vehicle's side, and Sky could hear the growing whine of turbines somewhere inside the machine's angular hull. He hesitated at the door, until his father beckoned that he lead. \"After you, Sky. Go and take the seat on the right of the instrument column. Don't touch anything while you're about it.\" C. Titus said nothing, but the point could not be denied. Sky had never been in the freight bay before; not even during one of the ill icit trips with Constanza. Sky remembered the time she had taken him to see the dolphins, and the punishment that had ensued, and how that punishment had been eclipsed by the ordeal that had fol lowed; the flash of light and the period he had spent trapped alone and cold in the utter darkness of the nursery. lt seemed so long ago now, but there were still things that he did not ful ly understand. No one would speak of that day when the whole ship had turned dark and cold, yet to Sky the events were still clearly fixed in his memory. D. His father settled into the seat next to him. The door had closed on them now, and suddenly it was quieter, save for the continuous rasp of the taxi's air-circulation. Hi s father touched the green display with his finger, making it change, studying the results with narrow-eyed concentration. E. \"I used to, once.\" His father eased the joystick forward now and the taxi commenced gliding along its departure track, sliding past the parked ranks of other vehicles. \"But machines aren't infallible. We used to kid ourselves that they were because it was the only way to stay sane in a place like this, where we depend on them for our every breath. Unfortunately it was never true.\" F. The spacecraft had some technical difficulty upon it's take-off. Titus and Sky jolted precariously as their taxi struggled to break through the atmosphere. Sky could feel his body begin to tremble with fear, but focused all his energy preventing that from happening. He did not dare let his father see him being anything but brave. G. Eventually, when something like normal shipboard life had returned, Sky managed to sneak back into the nursery. The room was lit, but everything else looked more or less as he had left it; Clown frozen in that distorted shape he had assumed after the flash. Sky had crept closer to examine his friend. Clown had been a kind of moving picture that only made sense when seen from precisely Sky's point of view. Clown had seemed to be physically present in the room - not just painted on the wall . For three years, Sky had never doubted that Clown was in some sense real. Yet his parents had given up responsibility to an illusion. "

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a ballet. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Romeo and juliet Four critics comment on the ballet production A. Returning to the stage after a long injury, Natalya Osipova is back in peak condition. She takes real risks in the giddy, swooning steps, swooping right off balance and trusting her Romeo, Carlos Acosta, to catch her. Yet this revival just falls short of passion. There's plenty of care in the storytelling, but the ballet's star-crossed lovers need headlong ardour and despair. it's been a long wait for Osipova to come back. She had surgery on her foot more than a year ago, with several return performances announced and cancelled. She's a sleek dancer, tall and dark, prompting extra attention. This performance shows new thought in her acting. Juliet is dancing with Paris, her approved fiance, when she first sees Romeo. She can't take her eyes off him, even when she tries to remember Paris. B. As one of the jewels in the Royal Ballet's crown, this rendition of Romeo and juliet offers a rare opportunity for dancer and spectator to forge a close relationship. Familiar as the story is, we can focus our entire attention on the interpretation without having to wonder what's coming next. In spite of Nicholas Georgiadis' monumental sets, this latest production is characterised by its extraordinary intimacy. lt takes a while to warm up as Carlos Acosta's Romeo doesn't appear to be unduly upset by his failed courtship of Rosaline and only really takes flight with the arrival of the three firecracker harlots (Laura Morera, Romany Pajdak and Laura McCulloch) who blast through the townspeople with exuberant naughtiness. As a prelude to the street fight between the Capulets and the Montagues, it is a terrific sequence, full of dazzle and spark. The key sequence that unlocks the production, is the grand ball with Prokoviev's magnificently doom-laden, Dance of the Knights, thundering out of the pit before the first encounter between the two lovers. С. Not quite what one m ight have hoped. Natalya Osipova's debut as Juliet with the Royal Ballet was eagerly anticipated: here is an artist prodigious in technique, vivid in dramatic sensibilities, who has illuminated every role t hat I have seen her dance. And yet on Thursday night, she seemed isolated at moments from the staging. This was, I sense, in part owed to an unlikely relationship with Carlos Acosta's Romeo. Osipova's pairing with Acosta brings her a secure partner, but also a dancer whose account of his role is now underpowered in both means and manner: I did not for a moment believe in him as a youth ardently in love. But what I once saw with Lynn Seymour, and saw with Natalya Makarova, and then ravishingly saw again last week with Yevgenia Obraztsova in the arms of Steven McRae was the traditional interpretation of the role. Unfortunately, Osipova, in trying to make the role her own, decides to show a knowing Juliet. D. The slim shoulders of the Russian ballerina Natalia Osipova were carrying a twin weight as she made her debut with London's Royal Ballet. Would this international shooting star be able to add lustre to a company that is depleted of ballerinas of her class? The answers to those questions varied from moment to moment during the course of the evening. Rarely has a performance flickered so rapidly between the astonishing and the disappointing. Having said that, the overall impression was satisfying, as one would expect from a dance company that has such a high profile leading lady. lt will be interesting to see how she continues to settle in with future productions with the Royal Ballet. WHICH REVIEWER: like reviewer A, remains unconvinced of the dancers' portrayal of the passion between Romeo and Juliet? 37_____; like reviewer C, had eagerly anticipated Osipova's performance, only to be disappointed in some way? 38_____; disagrees with the other three reviewers, in finding Osipova's performance faultless? 39_____; compares and contrasts this rendering with past performances of Romeo and Juliet? 40_____."

    "text": "You are going to read some articles written by different football players. For questions 47–56, choose from the articles (A–E). The articles may be chosen more than once.

Football players A. I started playing football seriously at a very young age. I played on teams all year long. But even that wasn't enough. When my dad would get home from work, we'd pass the ball back and forth until supper. As I got older, I'd invite my three best friends to come over to my house. They didn't really like football, but we had an agreement; I'd give them a snack, we'd watch a little TV, then we would play. One against three, and if I won, they had to play me again. During university I had a chance to try-out for a professional team in Germany and I thought, 'this is my chance to really make my dreams come true.' Yet, when I arrived in Germany, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had made a huge mistake. To make a long story short, I made the team, but turned them down and returned home. I had realised that my dream wasn't all I had built it up to be. I had imagined the glory of that life, but what I failed to consider was the fact that I would be doing it all alone, without my family and friends. So, I came home, finished university, and began coaching football. I love my job, and I still get to play football. it's more fun now than it's ever been. B. I come from a family of footballers. My dad played in competitive leagues all hi s life and my mum was on the national team. Needless to say, I began playing football at about the same time I began to walk. I played on the top teams since the age of thirteen. I was always the best on my team by far but, considering my background, that was expected. My parents were very committed to my football career and on some level I am very grateful. However, at times, their zeal was a little overwhelming. lt was always in my head that I was playing football mostly to please my parents, which really stripped the joy of the game from me. I still remember when my team won the biggest youth tournament in the nation. All my teammates were crying with joy and were so proud; I was just happy the tournament was over so I could go home and be with my friends. That's when I realised that while I may have the talent for the game, I didn't have the passion for it. So at age 16 I told my parents I didn't want to play anymore. I couldn't believe how supportive they were. I guess I put most of the pressure on myself. C. Football was always just one of my extra-curricular activities. I was president of my class at school, a member of the school orchestra, on the debate team, and in the autumn, I played football. I was a decent player, but definitely not the best. Tactics weren't my strength, but I was tough! lt was always a joke that I chose to go through other players, rather than around them. Of course, that aggressiveness didn't come without consequences. I left many games covered in bruises and blood, but the worst came the summer before my final year in high school when I was seriously injured and had to have knee surgery. I was devastated because I was supposed to be team captain that year and I was afraid they were going to take the title away from me. Lucki ly, I still got to be captain and I really loved my role from the sideline. I worked hard at my theraPY and was able to play in the last game of the season, which was great, but I had learned that my talents are best used on the sideline. I've been coaching youth teams for five years now. D. My parents were tired of me doing nothing but play video games so one day they said I was starting football practice. I protested a bit, but I knew my efforts would be worthless. My parents are unmovable. I have always hated exercise. I admit it. I am lazy. I went to practice prepared with multiple excuses to sit on the sidelines. I was getting the flu, I twisted my ankle, I was asthmatic. Yet, when I got there, I could tell by the look of the coach that he wasn't the kind of man who put up with excuses. There was something in his presence that told me he meant business. So I played the whole practice. And I really was the most awkward one out there. I never learned to love that game, but being on a team had some perks; at the end of every game some parent brought snacks. The snacks were undoubtedly the best part. I stuck with football until high school then became involved with the school newspaper, which really suits me better, considering I am not the world's best athlete. E. I've been a professional footballer for fifteen years now. That may seem like a lot considering my age, but older generations of women did not have the opportunity to play as youths. So when England decided to start its fir st women's national team, they had to recruit from a younger age group. The first five years were quite difficult. The team had basically no money. We stayed in cheap motel rooms or set up mats on gymnasium floors when we travelled. For a long time, despite our success, we had no fans, no news coverage, nothing. lt was definitely frustrating, but I also believe it is a huge testament to our love of the game. We didn't play for the glory or the fame. We played because we loved it. This is not to say we are not enjoying the recent attention being focused on our team; it is sure nice to finally be recognised, praised and admired for our hard work and talent. We have been through so much together, I feel like my teammates are my family. I work hard mainly because I know I owe it to them. And we support each other and encourage each other when one of us has made a mistake or is having a tough time getting through training. I'm a better player and person because of my teammates. true.\" F. The spacecraft had some technical difficulty upon it's take-off.

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a book about life in cities. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Image and the city In the city, we are barraged with images of the people we might become. Identity is presented as plastic, a matter of possessions and appearances; and a very large proportion of the urban landscape is taken up by slogans, advertisements, flatly photographed images of folk heroes - the man who turned into a sophisticated dandy overnight by drinking a particular brand of drink, the girl who transformed herself into a femme fatale with a squirt of cheap scent. The tone of the wording of these advertisements is usually pert and facetious, comically drowning in its own hyperbole. But the pictures are brutally exact: they reproduce every detail of a style of life, down to the brand of cigarette-lighter, the stone in the ring, and the economic row of books on the shelf. Yet, if one studies a line of ads across from where one is sitting on a tube train, these images radically conflict with each other. Swap the details about between the pictures, and they are instantly made illegible. If the characters they represent really are heroes, then they clearly have no individual claim to speak for society as a whole. The clean-cut and the shaggy, rakes, innocents, brutes, home-lovers, adventurers, clowns all compete for our attention and invite emulation. As a gallery, they do provide a glossy mirror of the aspirations of a representative city crowd; but it is exceedingly hard to discern a single dominant style, an image of how most people would like to see themselves. Even in the business of the mass-production of images of identity, this shift from the general to the diverse and particular is quite recent. Consider another line of stills: the back-lit, soft-focus portraits of the first and second generations of great movie stars. There is a degree of romantic unparticularity in the face of each one, as if they were communal dream-projections of society at large. Only in the specialised genres of westerns, farces and gangster movies were stars allowed to have odd, knobbly cadaverous faces. The hero as loner belonged to history or the underworld: he spoke from the perimeter of society, reminding us of its dangerous edges. ee so stse bee The stars of the last decade have looked quite different. Soft-focus photography has gone, to be replaced by a style which searches out warts and bumps, emphasises the uniqueness not the generality of the face. Voices, too, are strenuously idiosyncratic; whines, stammers and low rumbles are exploited as features of ‘star quality. Instead of romantic heroes and heroines, we have a brutalist, hard-edged style in which isolation and egotism are assumed as natural social conditions. In the movies, as in the city, the sense of stable hierarchy has become increasingly exhausted; we no longer live in a world where we can all share the same values, the same heroes. (It is doubtful whether this world, so beloved of nostalgia moralists, ever existed; but lip-service was paid to it, the pretence, at least, was kept up.) The isolate and the eccentric push towards the centre of the stage; their fashions and mannerisms are presented as having as good a claim to the limelight and the future as those of anyone else. In the crowd on the underground platform, one may observe a honeycomb of fully-worked-out worlds, each private, exclusive, bearing little comparison with its nearest neighbour. What is prized in one is despised in another. There are no clear rules about how one is supposed to manage one’s body, dress, talk, or think. Though there are elaborate protocols and ctiquettes among particular cults and groups within the city, they subscribe to no common standard. For the new arrival, this disordered abundance is the city’s most evident and alarming quality. He feels as if he has parachuted into a funfair of contradictory imperatives. There are so many people he might become, and a suit of clothes, a make of car, a brand of cigarettes, will go some way towards turning him into a personage even before he has discovered who that personage is. Personal identity has always been deeply rooted in property, but hitherto the relationship has been a simple one - a question of buying what you could afford, and leaving your wealth to announce your status. In the modern city, there are so many things to buy, such a quantity of different kinds of status, that the choice and its attendant anxieties have created a new pornography of taste. 31 What does the writer say about advertisements in the first paragraph? A Certain kinds are considered more effective in cities than others. B The way in which some of them are worded is cleverer than it might appear. C They often depict people that most other people would not care to be like. D The pictures in them accurately reflect the way that some people really live. 32 The writer says that if you look at a line of advertisements on a tube train, it is clear that A  city dwellers have very diverse ideas about what image they would like to have. B some images in advertisements have a general appeal that others lack. C city dwellers are more influenced by images on advertisements than other people are. D some images are intended to be representative of everyone's aspirations. 33 What does the writer imply about portraits of old movie stars? A  They tried to disquise the less attractive features of their subjects. B Most people did not think they were accurate representations of the stars in them. C They made people feel that their own faces were rather unattractive. D They reflected an era in which people felt basically safe. 34 What does the writer suggest about the stars of the last decade? A Some of them may be uncomfortable about the way they come across. B They make an effort to speak in a way that may not be pleasant on the ear. C They make people wonder whether they should become more selfish. D Most people accept that they are not typical of society as a whole. 35 The writer uses the crowd on an underground platform to exemplify his belief that A no single attitude to life is more common than another in a city. B no one in a city has strict attitudes towards the behaviour of others. C views of what society was like in the past are often inaccurate. D people in cities would like to have more in common with each other. 36 The writer implies that new arrivals in a city may A  change the image they wish to have too frequently. B  underestimate the importance of wealth. C acquire a certain image without understanding what that involves. D decide that status is of little importance."

    "text": " You are going to read an extract from an autobiography. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A-H the one which fits each gap (37-43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.Eilbeck the features editor I quickly got the hang of working at the Mirror. Every morning at eleven we would be expected to cram into Eilbeck's little office for a features conference, when we either had to come up with ideas of our own or suffer ideas to be thrust upon us. Some of Eilbeck's own offerings were bizarre to say the least, but he did get results. I had got an inkling of his creative thinking during my initial interview when he had invited me to match his scrawled impromptu headline with a feature. 37_________ Some of these brainstorms came off the day's news, some off the wall. About half the ideas worked, a few of them spectacularly. Following a spate of shootings, Eilbeck scrawled 'THIS GUN FOR SALE' on his pad, together with a rough sketch of a revolver. Within hours a writer was back in the office with a handgun and a dramatic piece on the ease with which (he did not mention the little help he had had from the crime staff) he had bought it in Trafalgar Square. 38_______ Mercifully, none of Eilbeck's extemporised headlines winged their way to me at least not yet. The pitifully small paper was grossly overstaffed, with half a dozen highly experienced feature writers fighting to fill one page a day, and it was evident that my role was as standby or first reserve. Hanging around the office, where the time was passed pleasantly in chit-chat, smoking and drinking coffee, I was occasionally tossed some small task. 39_______ Another of my little chores was to compose 'come- ons' for the readers' letters columns - invented, controversial letters that, in a slow week for correspondence, would draw a furious mailbag. I was also put to work rewriting agency and syndication material that came into the office, including, on occasion, the Sagittarius segment of the astrology column. 40_______ Some years later, when he had directed his talents to another paper, I confessed to him one day that I had been guilty of tampering in this way. He was in no way put out. It was serenely obvious to him that I had been planted on the Mirror by destiny to adjust the hitherto inaccurate information. 41________ For example, one afternoon I was summoned to Eilbeck's office to find him in a state of manic excitement, bent over a make-up pad on which he had scrawled 'THE SPICE OF LIFE!' surrounded by a border of stars. This, I was told, was to be the Mirror's new three-times-a-week gossip column, starting tomorrow - and I was to be in charge of it. 42____ Happily the delightful Eve Chapman was deputed to hold my hand in this insane exercise. The bad news was that Eve, who went home nightly to her parents in Croydon, had never set foot in such a place in her life. We were reduced to raiding the society pages of the glossy magazines and ploughing through Who's Who in hopes of finding some important personage with an unusual hobby which could be fleshed out to the maximum twenty-five words. 43______ The Spice of Life column itself ground to a halt after our supply of eminent people's interesting pastimes petered out. A. As a result, he wanted no item to be more than twenty-five words long, followed by three dots. He was, at the time, heavily under the influence of Walter Winchell, Earl Wilson and suchlike night-owl columnists in the New York tabloids that were air-freighted to him weekly. B. Flattering though it was to be entrusted with this commission, there was a snag. It had to ‘sizzle’ – a favourite Elbeck word – with exclusive snippets about ‘the people who really mattered’ – to Elbeck’s mind, anyone with an aristocratic title, or money to throw about in casinos and nightclubs. Unfortunately, I did not have a single suitable contact in the whole of London. C. This might be a review copy of some ghosted showbiz memoirs that might be good for a 150-word anecdotal filler. One day Elbeck dropped a re-issued volume on my desk – To Beg I am Ashamed, the supposed autobiography of a criminal. It came complete with one of his headlines: ‘IT’S STILL A BAD, DANGEROUS BOOK’. I asked him what was so bad and dangerous about it. ‘I haven’t read it,’ the Features Editor confessed cheerfully. ‘Two hundred words by four o’clock’. D. On one desperate occasion, with the deadline looming yet again, we fell to working our way along Millionaires’ Row in Kensington, questioning maids and chauffeurs about the foibles of their rich employers. This enterprise came to a stop after someone called the police. E. This proved to be a foretaste of his favourite method of floating an idea. While the assembled feature writers clustered around his desk skimming the newspapers and intermittently quoting some story that might with luck yield a feature angle, Elbeck would be scribbling away on his pad. Cockily trumpeting his newly minted headline – ‘WOULD YOU RISK A BLIND DATE HOLIDAY?’ or ‘CAN WOMEN BE TRUSTED WITH MONEY?’ – he would rip off the page and thrust it into the arms of the nearest writer – ‘Copy by four o’clock.’ F. This was for the benefit of one of the paper’s more irascible executives who was a passionate believer in it. It had been noticed that when he was told he would have a bad day he would react accordingly and his miserable colleagues would go through the day quaking in their shoes. My job was to doctor the entry to give his colleagues a more peaceful ride. G. My month’s trial with the Mirror quickly expired without my having done anything to justify my existence on the paper, but since Elbeck didn’t mention that my time was up, neither did I. I pottered on, still trying to find my feet. Occasionally opportunity would knock, but it was usually a false alarm. Not always, though. H. But many of Elbeck’s madder flights of fancy had no chance of panning out so well – even I could tell that. Seasoned writers would accept the assignment without demur, repair to a café for a couple of hours, and then ring in to announce that they couldn’t make the idea stand up."

Wafting from savoury to toasted, fruity to oily, the aroma emanates from the 89-year-old factory of Valrhona, one of the most respected chocolate makers in the business. I was inhaling this heady perfume on a trip to find out about Valrhona’s first book, the fabulous Cooking with Chocolate. A vast tome, it’s a chocophile’s dream, with pages of chocolate information alongside recipes, from the ultimate sachertorte to ‘Bittersweet Chocolate Bars, Salted Butter Caramel and Crystallised Almonds’. Most are mesmerizingly complex creations strictly for trained chefs or timerich amateurs; mouthwatering for the rest of us. Best of all are the pages on techniques such as the all-important tempering (a heating and cooling process that keeps the shine and texture of chocolate when it is remoulded), all minutely described and carefully illustrated. B. I’d expect nothing less from Valrhona, which we have to thank for the quiet revolution in chocolate of the past 25 years. Back in the early 1980s, plain chocolate meant a cocoa solids content of barely 40 per cent. Then, in the early 1990s, cookery writers began telling us to use chocolate with ‘minimum 50 per cent cocoa solids’. The supermarkets started stocking real cooking chocolate with escalating levels of cocoa solids. It was Valrhona that first introduced a 70 per cent cocoa solids chocolate bar to the market in 1986. It caused a flurry among chefs, who found that it gave a far more intense chocolate flavour to their dishes, and it was given star billing on menus. Since then an army of boutique chocolate makers has been born. They all produce chocolate in a ‘bean-to-bar’ process, transforming raw, fermented beans into chocolate themselves. It’s an important distinction, as many other companies buy ready-made chocolate in bulk and re-melt it to form bars and chocolate sweets. C. Inside Valrhona’s newest factory on the outskirts of town, Luce, our elegantly grey-haired guide, leads us past paintings of the chefs who are fans of Valrhona. The smell grows ever headier and sweeter as we enter a windowless, high-ceilinged room with a cream-tiled floor, on which neat rows of sacks are waiting for processing. Inside are fermented and dried beans, but the dull brown seeds have a long way to go before they can live up to their botanical name, Theobroma: ‘food of the gods’. In the next room that process is beginning, as the beans are roasted in huge rotating drums, then cooled and crushed to peppercorn-sized pieces. Just across the room, a lone worker is supervising the grinding of the nibs through pairs of rollers. It’s this powder, he explains, which constitutes the ‘cocoa solids’ in the chocolate bar, and is mixed with extra cocoa butter (the fatty component of the cocoa bean), sugar, vanilla and emulsifier, usually soya lecithin, to make plain chocolate. Milk chocolate has milk powder added as well. They are ground together to make a paste refined to grains no bigger than 17 microns - the tongue can detect nothing below 20 microns. All the machines are thickly coated with cream-coloured paint and have a vintage air, like a ship’s engine room. It turns out they date from the 1960s. ‘We bought modern ones, which were much more efficient, but they just didn’t produce such good chocolate, so we went back to these,’ explains Luce, as we head to the conching machines. These huge mixers stir the chocolate ingredients for up to three days, combining them at 60-70C and developing the flavours. D. But can a bar ever contain too much cocoa solids? I ask Pierre Costet, head taster for Valrhona, over a table of chocolate samples. “Yes’. The blend of beans with cocoa butter and sugar should vary according to the subtleties of the flavour. Costet also believes the merits of the three varieties of cacao bean are exaggerated. It is widely accepted that Criollo (mostly from Venezuela) is the connoisseur’s choice and Trinitario, grown in South and Central America, is the best mainstream variety. Forestero, grown in Africa, is considered coarse, mass-market stuff. This, Costet tells me, is too simplistic. First, because cacao trees are grown from seed by the farmers, they may have been cross-pollinated with the other varieties anyway. Second, how the beans are grown and fermented makes a huge difference, so a well-looked-after Forestero may well be better than a poorly treated Criollo."

Unsustainable tourism We are increasingly familiar with some of the worst effects of unthinking, unmanaged, unsustainable tourism: previously undeveloped coastal villages that have become sprawling, charmless towns, their seas poisoned by sewage, denuded of wildlife, their beaches stained with litter and tubes of suncream; and historic towns, their streets now choked with traffic, their temples, churches and cathedrals seemingly reduced to a backdrop for holiday snaps that proclaim, ‘Been there, Done that’. Less appreciated, perhaps, is the social dislocation unsustainable tourism can cause: once-cohesive communities disrupted as the holiday industry replaces old crafts, turning fishermen into tour boat operators and farmers into fast-food store waiters or hotel cleaners. Criticism of the tourism industry Although its strongest critics view the tourism industry as a rapacious predator — moving on to fresh conquests after one environment has been spoiled, and forever fuelling the desires of holidaymakers with the prospect of a new paradise that must be enjoyed ‘before it’s gone’ - there are many within the industry who reject the claim. They are at least partly right. There are examples where the travel trade is doing better. Of course, reforming initiatives often come after the damage has been done and in some cases for public relations purposes rather than from a commitment to sustainability. Write your essay."

Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Paul watched the television above the bar. An army of turtles waddled up a beach, cumbersome helmets dragged through the fine sand to deposit a clutch of smooth, white eggs in the dunes. He saw the wriggling reptilian babies emerge sticky from the broken shells and repeat the journey in reverse, thousands of tiny helmets trundling inexorably over the moonlit dunes towards the breakers. Those who escaped being flipped over on their backs and pecked to death by wading birds were finally swallowed up in the surf. There was no pleasure involved in this reptilian cycle of birth and death. The turtles survived purely because there were so many of them, and the oceans were so vast, that one or two were bound to slip through unnoticed. He wondered why they bothered, and presumed it could only be because they had no choice. Their genes forced them ever onwards - life would not be denied. Previous generations had imposed their will upon their distant descendants, and the descendants wearily obeyed. If, by chance, a turtle was born in whom this instinct towards multiplication was misformed or absent, a turtle whose instincts directed them not towards reproduction but towards reflection on the purpose of reproduction, say, or towards seeing how long it could stay underwater on one breath, then this instinct would die with the turtle. The turtles were condemned to multiply purely by the breeding success of their own ancestors. There was no escape for them. Multiplication, once set in motion, was unstoppable. At the present moment, the balance of his own inclinations tilted more towards sleep, the cessation of thought, hibernation, vegetation. Had he been one of those tiny helmets, he would, at that moment, have flipped over belly-up in the sand and simply awaited the releasing beak. Parenthood had taken him by surprise. The books, the articles, the classes, had not prepared him for the intensity of it all. Snap decisions to be made, everybody looking to him for the answers, and no way of knowing if he had made the correct guess, no way of finding his way back to the main track if he took a wrong turning. Last night he had been half a couple. He had lived with others all his life. It was easy - you had rows, you had Parenthood resentments, but if they became too frequent or too boring, or if the compensations ceased to be adequate, you just left, and tried again with someone else until you found someone you could put up with. He could not remember how it had all changed. Perhaps it had been the doors of youth and liberty creaking shut behind him, or the demands that were suddenly being made of him, the faces turning towards him when a decision was required. Or perhaps it was just the steaming concoction of his emotions, his hormones, his thoughts slopping around his veins with the coffee and nicotine. Whatever it was, something had obliged him to seck out a tranquil place in order to restore some order to his metabolism. Then there was the feeling that he had been duped - the one feeling that he hadn’t been warned of - when he saw mother and baby together and realized that the reason why everyone made such a big deal of fatherhood these days was simply because it was such an implausible state. Mothers and babies were the world. Fathers were optional extras, accessories. If some strange virus colonized the Y-chromosome and poisoned all the men, the world would carry on. It would not be a very exciting world perhaps, rather bland and predictable, but women would find some way to reproduce, and within a generation or two it would be difficult to believe that there had ever been men at all. They would appear in the encyclopaedias somewhere between dinosaurs and Romans. Future generations of little girls would try, in vain, to understand what it had been that men had done, how they had contributed. What use had they been? He had suddenly seen his role exposed as that of a footnote. The books had warned him of this feeling, of jealousy, of irrelevance and superfluity. They had said it was natural, that he would get over it. What they had not said was that it was natural because it was so manifestly, poignantly true, or that he would get over it only by stopping thinking about it. Fathers deceived themselves. Mothers and babies held it all together. The men came and went, interchangeably, causing trouble and bringing presents to make up for it. 31 What did Paul notice about the turtles in the first paragraph? A their reluctance to return to the sea B their behaviour with their young C_ the effort they made to survive D the tiny proportion of young who survived 32 Paul assumed that if a turtle did not wish to reproduce, A_ it would be punished by other turtles. B it would end up doing so anyway. C this attitude would not spread to other turtles. D this would not come as a surprise. 33 His thoughts turned towards going to sleep because A_ he knew that he was unlikely to get much in the near future. B he had been left mentally exhausted by becoming a parent. C he had become weary of his actions being criticized. D he felt that that was what many of the turtles probably wanted to do. 34 What did he feel he had been forced to do since last night? A accept that he was not really cut out for living with other people B find a way of making himself feel better physically C identify precisely what had caused his life to change so radically D remind himself of how he had felt prior to this 35 In what way did he feel that he had been duped? A He had expected his role to be one that differed from that of most men. B He had not been informed about how women changed when they became mothers. C He had not been told the truth by women about how they really regarded men. D He had thought fatherhood was treated as a major subject because fathers were important. 36 He felt that the books had failed to warn him that his feeling of irrelevance A_ would not fade away naturally. B would not be shared by others. C would be replaced by worse feelings. D would reduce him to inactivity."

Bryan Richardson greeted me warmly, and ushered me into his modest office, somewhat larger than the others along the corridor, but without pretensions of any kind. He returned to his desk, which had two phones and a mobile on it, and a lot of apparently unsorted papers, offered me a chair, and said it was nice to see me again. I rather doubt he remembered me at all, but it had the effect of making me feel a little less anxious. 37)______ 'I want to talk to you about an idea I have,' I said. 'I have supported this club since the 1970s, and I'm starting to get frustrated by watching so much and knowing so little.' He gazed at me with a degree of interest mixed with incomprehension. 'What I mean,' I added, 'is that every football fan is dying to know what is really like, what's actually going on, yet all we get to see is what happens on the field.' 38)_____ And I didn't wish to be fobbed off. 'They all make it worse, not better. They all purvey gossip and rumours, and most of what they say turns out to be either uninteresting or incorrect. Your average supporter ends up in the dark most of the time.' 39)_____ 'Now that,' I said, 'is just the sort of thing I want to know about. I'd like to write a book about the club this coming season, to know about the deals, the comings and goings, all the factors involved. To get to know how a Premiership football club actually works.' As I said this, I feared that it was a futile request, but I'd drawn a little hope from the fact that he had just been so open, as if he had already decided to consider the project. 'I want to know about buying and selling players, how the finances work, to go down to the training ground, travel with the team, talk to the players and the manager.' 40)_____ So I continued with it. 'Let me tell you a little about myself.' He leaned back to make himself comfortable, sensing that this might take a while. 'By training I'm an academic. I came here from America in the 1960s, got a doctorate in English at Oxford, then taught in the English Department at Warwick University for fifteen years. Now I run my own business, dealing in rare books and manuscripts in London, and do some freelance writing. But I'm not a journalist.' 41)_____ I was starting to babble now, and as I spoke I was aware of how foolish all this must be sounding to him. At one point he put his hands quietly on his lap, under the desk, and I had the distinct, if paranoid, impression that he was ringing some sort of hidden alarm, and that three orange-shirted stewards would shortly come in and escort me from the ground (By Order of the Chairman). 42)_____ 'But a book is certainly a good idea,' he said. 'Let me think it over and I'll get back to you.' He stood up and we shook hands. 'I'll be in touch,' he said. And a few weeks later, in mid-August, he was. 'There's a great story here,' he said. 'Go ahead and do it next season. I'll introduce you to the people up here at the club. Go everywhere, talk to everybody, you'll find it fascinating.' I was surprised, and delighted, but tried not to gush. 'Thank you,' I said. 'It's very open-minded of you.' 43)_____ 'Yes, sure,' he said. 'But I mean something more than that, something more complicated.' 'What's that?' I asked. He smiled. 'You'll see.' A. The disappointment must have registered on my face, because he quickly added: ‘| came to all this relatively late in my career, and it’s a fascinating business. | find it more so all the time, and | don’t have any doubt that people would be interested to read an account of it.’ B. ‘We've got nothing to hide,’ he said, ‘but you'll be surprised by what you learn. It’s an amazingly emotional business.’ ‘It must be,’ | said, ‘the supporters can see that. So many of the games are like an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes the whole season is.’ C. He nodded gently. ‘Good,’ he said firmly. ‘That's part of the point,’ | went on. ‘l want to write about the club from the point of view of the supporters, a sort of fan's eye view. Getting behind the scenes is every fan's dream - whether it’s here or somewhere else. I've never written anything like this, although | have written a couple of books. And | am trained, as an academic, in habits of analysis, in trying to figure out how things work. And I'm a supporter of the club, so | don't think there is anything to fear.’ D. As | was speaking, the mobile phone rang, and he answered it with an apologetic shrug. A brief and cryptic one-sided conversation ensued, with obscure references to hotels and phone numbers. When he hung up, he explained: ‘We're trying to sign a full-back. Good player. But there are three agents involved, and two continental sides want to sign him, so we've got him hidden in a hotel. If we can keep them away from him for another couple of days, he'll sign.’ E He considered this for a moment. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘there is the ClubCall line, the match-day programmes, and the articles in the local and national papers. There's lots of information about.’ He sounded like a politician trying to claim for his party the moral authority of open government, while at the same time giving nothing away. F. Not at all. ‘It’s funny you should ask,’ he said, ‘because you're the second person this week who has come in with a request to write a book about the club. And I've just been approached by the BBC with a proposal to do a six-part documentary about the club. ‘Are you going to let them do it?’ | asked. ‘I don’t think,’ he said wryly, ‘that a six-part series on what a nice club Coventry City is would make good television.’ G. ‘So, what can | do for you?’ He made it sound as if he were interested. Poised and well dressed, though without foppishness, he had that indefinable polish that one often observes in people of wealth or celebrity. By polish | do not mean good manners, though that frequently accompanies it, but something more tangible: a kind of glow, as if the rich and famous applied some mysterious ointment (available only to themselves) every morning, and then buffed their faces to a healthy sheen. H. There, I'd done it. The worst that he could do was to tell me to get lost. Part of me, to tell the truth, would have been just a little relieved. But he didn’t do anything. He sat quite still, listening, letting me make my pitch."

The sections may be chosen more than once. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.

In 2006, James Levine, a scientist based at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, conducted a very strange experiment. He wanted to measure something which goes by the cumbersome title of Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis - or NEAT. Essentially, this examines how people move about during an average day - not when they’re exercising, but when they’re making no special effort to keep fit. The big question was just how to do the measuring - and here Levine hit upon a radical plan. He decided to put his volunteers into specially sensored underwear. This would measure their every waking and sleeping moment. Levine, incidentally, is no stranger to weird experiments. Aged 10, he’d placed 15 pond snails in a glass tank and tracked their movements every hour across a piece of wax paper. Twelve months and 200 wax paper trials later, he came to the same conclusion that he reached 23 years later in his sensored underwear experiment. All creatures have a biological imperative to move - and movement, perhaps more than anything else, is good for us. B. By the same token, lack of movement is very bad indeed. The NEAT experiment revealed that lean people burn around 350 more calories a day just by fidgeting, pacing about, or walking to the coffee machine. As for the non-lean ones, they just sat there, getting ever more bloated and unfit. Sitting down, Levine concluded, is not just bad for people - it’s a killer. This may seem a bit drastic, but Levine isn’t the only scientist who reckons that being sedentary offers an accelerated route to an early grave. However, the vast majority of us move about less and less. As labour-intensive jobs disappear, we live in an increasingly sedentary world, spending our working lives stuck in a chair and ever larger amounts of our leisure time too. We know that exercise is good for us and that sitting down all day isn’t - we just choose to ignore it. C. Soon after the end of the Second World War, a British health researcher called Jerry Morris set up a study to examine why record numbers of people were dying of heart attacks. The first results Morris got in were from London busmen. Immediately, he saw that there was a striking difference: drivers were twice as likely to suffer a heart attack as conductors. To begin with, this didn’t make sense. After all, they were much the same age, ate much the same food and so on. There was only one key difference. Whereas the drivers spent their days behind the wheel, conductors spent theirs running up and down the stairs. Morris thought he might be on to something, but it was still too early to say: he had to wait for other data to arrive. Then came the figures for postal workers. These were strikingly similar to the bus drivers: the postmen who delivered the mail by bike and on foot had markedly fewer heart attacks than the ones who served behind counters. His paper, ‘Coronary Heart-disease and Physical Activity of Work’, D Two hundred years ago, people was published in 1953 - and greeted with hoots of derision by his peers. But Morris, as people slowly began to concede, was onto something. D. Two hundred years ago, people may have led much less sedentary lives, but they still had an inkling that sitting down wasn’t doing them any good. No one seems to know exactly when the standing desk was invented, but by the mid 19th century, they were a regular fixture in the offices and homes of the rich. But if people could get used to working standing up, could they go one step further? One evening in 2007, Levine was in his office thinking about the relationship between exercise and fitness when he had an idea. Instead of people nipping off to the gym and then coming back to slump at their desks, maybe they could exercise at the same time as working. Sliding a hospital tray on top of a treadmill, Levine set it to a modest 2mph. To his surprise, he found he could work perfectly easily while he was walking along. He could type, make phone calls and do almost everything that he normally did sitting down. Yet after an hour, he’d burned off more than 100 calories. It was, as he admits, an eccentric invention. ‘There was a notion floating about that I had completely flipped.’ But television stations began doing news reports, and all at once people didn’t think he was so nutty after all. Soon, the treadmill desk, or Walkstation as it was called, had gone into commercial production."

The birth of ‘youth culture’ In the early 1960s, a new wave of romantic enthusiasm and innovation - political, spiritual and cultural, or rather, countercultural - broke over the Western world. At first, only a few social and aesthetic radicals were involved in what presently came to be called the Youth Culture. The majority of right-thinking persons were offended or bored by the new music, the new art and the new politics, but a shrewd student of fashion, observing what was being worn on the streets of Europe and America, might have predicted that in a few years youth would be adored and emulated everywhere; that, indeed, simply to be under 30 would be accounted a virtue. What is ‘youth culture’? It has been arqued that the ‘youth culture’ that began in the 1960s was the product of manipulation of impressionable young people by commercial interests, that youth culture is really no more than the range of products available specifically for the young. Others have tried to explain youth subcultures, not in terms of mindless consumption but in terms of genuine style innovation, and the generation of styles which ‘say’ something about the social and economic conditions in which those young people live, their experiences and their aspirations.

It was - at least as far as that catholic and capacious category known as ‘light entertainment’ was concerned - as close as British television had ever come, in some forty-one years of trying, to being a genuinc mass medium. None of the usual rigid divisions and omissions were apparent in the broad audience of that remarkable night: no stark class bias, no pronounced gender imbalance, no obvious age asymmetry, no generalized demographic slant. It was also, of course, an extraordinary night for the two stars of the show: Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise - by far the most illustrious, and the bestloved, double-act that Britain has ever produced. Exceptionally professional yet endearingly personable, they were wonderful together as partners, as friends, as almost a distinct entity: not ‘Morecambe and Wise’ but ‘Morecambewise’ There was Eric and there was Ernie: one of them an idiot, the other a bigger idiot, each of them half a star, together a whole star, forever hopeful of that ‘brand new, bright tomorrow’ that they sang about at the end of each show. True, Eric would often slap Ernie smartly on the cheeks, but they clearly thought the world of each other, and the world thought a great deal of them, too. Their show succeeded in attracting such a massive following on that memorable night because it had, over the course of the previous nine years or so, established, and then enhanced, an enviable reputation for consistency, inventiveness, unparalleled professional polish and, last but by no means least, a strong and sincere respect for its audience. The Morecambe & Wise Show stood for something greater, something far more precious, than mere first-rate but evanescent entertainment; it had come to stand — just as persuasively and as proudly as any earnest documentary or any epic drama - for excellence in broadcasting, the result not just of two gifted performers (great talent, alas, does not of itself guarantee great television) but also of a richly proficient and supremely committed production team. The show, culminating in the record-breaking triumph of that 1977 special, represented an achievement in high-quality popular programme-making that is now fast assuming the aura of a fairy tale - destined, one fears, to be passed on with bemused fascination from one doubtful gencration to its even more disbelieving successor as the seemingly endless proliferation of new channels and novel forms of distraction continue to divide and disperse the old mass audience in the name of that remorseless quest for ‘quality demographics’ and ‘niche audiences’ The Morecambe & Wise Show appearcd at a time before home video, before satellite dishes and cable technology, before the dawning of the digital revolution, a time when it was still considered desirable to make a television programme that might - just might - excite most of the people most of the time. Neither Morecambe nor Wise ever looked down on, Or up at, anyone (except, of course, each other); both of them looked straight back at their audience on level terms. No cclebrated guest was ever allowed to challenge this comic democracy: within the confines of the show, the rich and famous went unrecognised and frequently unpaid (a running gag); venerable actors with grand theatrical reputations were mocked routinely by Eric’s sotto voce comments; and two resolutcly down-to-earth working-class comedians gleefully reaffirmed the remarkably deep, warm and sure relationship that existed between themselves and the British public. ‘It was, reminiseed Ernie Wise, ‘a sort of great big office party for the whole country, a bit of fun people could understand: From the first few seconds of their opening comic routine to the final few notes and motions of their closing song and dance, Morecambe and Wisc did their very best to draw people together rather than drive them apart. Instead of pandering submissively to the smug exclusivity of the cognoscenti (they werc flattered when a well-regarded critic praised the sly ‘ocillade’ that accompanied Eric’s sarcastic asides, but they still mocked him mercilessly for his use of the word), and instead of settling - as so many of their supposcd successors would do with unsecmly haste - for the easy security of a ‘cult following’, Morecambe and Wise always aimed to entertain the whole nation. 31 The writer implies in the first paragraph that one reason why the show on 25 December 1977 was extraordinary was that A_ light entertainment programmes had been the targets of criticism before then. B noone had thought that a British television programme could appeal to all classes. C_ its audience included people who might not have been expected to watch it. D people tuning into it knew that they were taking part in a phenomenal event. 32 In the second paragraph, the writer implies that Morecambe and Wise € 1Sal A would probably not have been successful had they been solo performers. B had a different relationship in real life from the one they had on television. C were keen for audiences to realize how professional they were. D probably did not know how popular they were. 33 The writer says in the third paragraph that one reason why The Morecambe & Wise Show remained so popular was that A it adapted to changes in audience attitudes to what constituted good entertainment. B it appealed to people who normally preferred other kinds of programme. C the people who made it knew that its popularity was guaranteed. D the contribution of people other than its stars was a key element in it. 34 The writer suspects that The Morecambe & Wise Show will in the future be regarded as A something which might only catch on with certain audiences. B something which has acquired an exaggerated reputation. C the kind of programme that programme-makers will aspire to. D the kind of programme that illustrates the disadvantages of technological advances. 35 According to the writer, one feature of The Morecambe & Wise Show was A the way in which it reflected developments in British society. B its inclusion of jokes that only certain people would understand. C_ the consistent way in which other stars were treated on it. D its careful choice of other stars to appear on it. 36 In the last paragraph, the writer implies that A other comedians have attempted to appeal to only a particular group of people. B Morecambe and Wise usually disregarded what critics said about them. C other comedians have not accorded Morecambe and Wise the respect they deserve. D Morecambe and Wise realized that there were some people who would never like them."

There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Inspector John Rebus was pretending to stare at the meerkats when he saw the man. For the best part of an hour, Rebus had been trying to blink away a headache, which was about as much exercise as he could sustain. He’d planted himself on benches and against walls, wiping his brow even though Edinburgh’s early spring was a blood relative of midwinter. His shirt was damp against his back, uncomfortably tight every time he rose to his feet. 37)______ He hadn’t been to the zoo in years; thought probably the last time had been when he’d brought his daughter to see Palango the gorilla. Sammy had been so young, he’d carried her on his shoulders without feeling the strain. 38)______ Not very, he hoped. The penguin parade had come and gone while he was by the meerkats. Now, oddly, it was when the visitors moved on, seeking excitement, that the first of the meerkats appeared, rising on its hind legs, body narrow and wavering, scouting the territory. 39)______ There were worse, he had reminded himself, applying his thoughts to the day’s central question: who was poisoning the zoo animals of Edinburgh? The fact of the matter was, some individual was to blame. Somebody cruel and calculating and so far missed by surveillance cameras and keepers alike. 40)______ Meantime, as senior staff had indicated, the irony was that the poisoner had actually been good for business. There’d been no copycat offences yet, but Rebus wondered how long that would last. 41)______ As a child, his roll-call of pets had seen more than its fair share of those listed ‘Missing in Action’ or ‘Killed in the Line of Duty’. His tortoise had absconded, despite having its owner’s name painted on its shell; several budgies had failed to reach maturity; and ill-health had plagued his only goldfish. Living as he did in a tenement flat, he’d never been tempted in adulthood by the thought of a cat or dog. He’d tried horse-riding once, rubbing his inside legs raw in the process and vowing afterwards that the closest he’d come in future to the noble beast would be on a betting slip. 42)______ Except the animals wouldn’t share a human’s curiosity. They would be unmoved by any display of agility or tenderness, would fail to comprehend that some game was being played. Animals would not build zoos, would have no need of them. Rebus was wondering why humans needed them. The place suddenly became ridiculous to him, a chunk of prime Edinburgh real estate given over to the unreal … And then he saw the camera. 43)______ Rebus knew the man. Hadn’t seen him in probably four years but couldn’t forget eyes like that. Rebus sought for a name, at the same time reaching into his pocket for his radio. The photographer caught the movement, eyes turning to match Rebus’s gaze. Recognition worked both ways. And then the man was off, walking briskly downhill. Rebus yanked out his radio.  A) He moved away from it, but not too far, and proceeded to untie and tie a shoelace, which was his way of marking the quarter-hours. Zoos and the like had never held any fascination for him. B) Rebus looked away, turning in the direction of its subjects: children. Children leaning into the meerkat enclosure. All you could see were shoe-soles and legs, and the backs of skirts and T-shirts and jerseys. C) Past a restaurant and cafeteria, past couples holding hands and children attacking ice-creams. Peccaries, otters, pelicans. It was all downhill, for which Rebus was thankful. The walkway narrowed just at the point where the crowd thickened. Rebus wasn’t sure what was causing the bottleneck, then heard cheers and applause. D) Two more then followed it, appearing from their burrow, circling, noses to the ground. They paid little attention to the silent figure seated on the low wall of their enclosure; passed him time and again as they explored the same orbit of hard-packed earth, jumping back only when he lifted a handkerchief to his face. He was feeling the effects of an early-morning double espresso from one of the kiosks near The Meadows. He’d been on his way to work, on his way to learning that today’s assignment was zoo patrol. E) The capybara had looked at him almost with pity, and there had seemed a glint of recognition and empathy behind the long-lashed eye of the hunched white rhino, standing so still it might have been a feature in a shopping mall, yet somehow dignified in its very isolation. Rebus felt isolated, and about as dignified as a chimpanzee. F) Police had a vague description, and spot-checks were being made of visitors’ bags and coat pockets, but what everyone really wanted - except perhaps the media - was to have someone in custody, preferably with the tainted tidbits locked away as evidence. G) On the other hand, he’d liked the meerkats, for a mixture of reasons: the resonance of their name; the low comedy of their rituals; their instinct for self-preservation. Kids were dangling over the wall now, legs kicking in the air. Rebus imagined a role reversal - cages filled with children, peered at by passing animals as they capered and squealed, loving the attention. H) Today, though, he had nothing with him but a concealed radio and set of handcuffs. He wondered how conspicuous he looked, walking such a narrow admit while shunning the attractions further up and down the slope, stopping now and then at the kiosk to buy a can of Irn-Bru."

Everyone has a relationship with an animal in my collection. When people ask me about an animal I haven’t done, I then introduce it to the collection.’ Her favourite? ‘The ram. It’s so strong.’ Franklin hand-makes each necklace, bangle, ring, cufflink and pin, featuring any of 14 animal heads, from a pig to a triceratops. All her pieces are made in solid silver, plated in 22ct yellow gold or black rhodium, with black diamonds and freshwater pearls. Bespoke commissions, predominantly engagement rings, not all animal-related, are becoming more frequent. Her clients are all ages, women and men with a bold sense of style. Franklin’s robust designs are instantly recognisable, as she has discovered. ‘I see a surprising number of people wearing my designs in the street, mainly in east London,’ she says. ‘Recently in a pub this girl was wearing one of my rings at the bar so I introduced myself. She was completely star-struck and fetched over her dad, who had bought it for her. I had to explain that it was really me who was excited.’ B Alexandra Jefford ‘My design style constantly evolves,’ Alexandra Jefford says. ‘It started out as a throwback to the 1940s, but even though I try new things I can’t kick my art background. I’m really inspired by art, architecture, design, furniture design.’ Jefford graduated with a degree in fine art, began designing jewellery and sold her first piece, a gold ring, on its first outing, at dinner with a friend. Her designs, produced on a project-byproject basis rather than as collections, include her signature Alphabet series for which she designed a slim font. Her recent O project interprets that letter in various typefaces. Jefford also makes one-off high-end pieces that are more sculptural. Fans range from her daughter’s friends to her mother’s friends, although she doesn’t always want to sell. ‘I become emotionally involved with all my pieces so I find it really hard to let go. There are some pieces that I hide “for the family museum”. My husband says that I work as a shopper rather than a seller.’ C Hattie Rickards Hattie Rickards’ first collection of 12 rings, entitled Revealed, was an instant success. Her second, Geo, a collection of 15 tactile, geometric necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and a brooch, came out to even greater acclaim. ‘The ethos behind Geo is connection and relationships, bringing tessellating or geometrical shapes together making one, for example the Kindred ring where two puzzle pieces fit neatly together.’ Rickards graduated in jewellery design, then worked for Solange Azagury-Partridge, helping to launch her Madison Avenue store in New York, before setting up on her own. ‘I wanted to create a high-end, luxury jewellery brand with an ethical backbone, which coincided with a gap in the market.’ All Hattie Rickards Jewellery is made using Fairtrade precious stones from Thailand and India and 18ct Fairtrade, fair-mined gold from Colombia. HRJ is one of the first 20 companies to become a certified user of this type of gold, many of its pieces having the premium ‘ecological’ label, which ensures no cyanide is used during extraction, which is harmful to the environment. There are no plans for e-commerce, as Rickards believes this detracts from the meaning behind the piece. ‘I am passionate that people understand the symbolism behind my work. I don’t want it to just be a ring on a website. The story is so important.’ D Mawi Keivom Mawi Keivom is known for her architectural statement jewellery: chunky box chains with coloured pearls, spiked gold rings and brightly coloured gems. Born in the north-east of India, 40 miles from the Burmese border, into the Mahr tribe, Keivom draws her influences from a peripatetic childhood with her diplomat parents that took them to Africa, the Middle East, south-east Asia and Europe. ‘I come from a tribal background and having that heritage has influenced me greatly; the colours, the chunky jewels, the sparkle.’ Keivom designs two collections a year. ‘My style of jewellery is very individual and not for the faint-hearted. I have a very strong vision that translates into an industrial, graphic aesthetic offset with crystals and pearls that are a little bit feminine. I don’t try to do something that is for the moment. My pieces are classics in their own right, not trend-specific.’"

Children's games: past v present It is characteristic of the human race that change is constantly deplored, and that ‘the good old days’ are believed to have been far better than the present day. In the realm of children’s games, the fixed idea is that children ‘don’t play games any more’, or ‘don’t have the fun we used to have’. Adults can be savagely critical of the supposed sophistication or inertia of contemporary schoolchildren, and equally self-righteous about their own childhoods. The much re-iterated phrase is, ‘We used to make our own amusements.’ At the same time, they all but prevent their children from making their own amusements by supplying them with generous pocket-money and giving them expensive toys. Changes in children’s games If children played their games invariably in the way the previous generation played them, the study of youthful recreation could be a matter merely of antiquarian scholarship. But they do not. Despite the motherly influence of tradition, children’s play is like every other social activity; it is subject to continual change. The fact that games are played slightly differently in different places, and may even vary in name, is itself evidence that mutation takes place. And for reasons that are usually social or environmental, some games become impracticable, while others are overlaid or replaced by new versions that are found to be more satisfactory.

So how come in the prime of my life, at the height of my powers, I could not foresee what would happen in the Torkelson case? Was I too street smart? Had I been around the block so many times that I had finally lost my sense of direction? Ages ago, soon after I became a criminal defense lawyer, Fat Mikey LoTriglio hailed me across the vast concrete expanse of the courthouse steps. ‘Hey, girlie!’ His tomato of a face wore an expression that seemed (I squinted) amiable, pretty surprising considering he'd just been sprung from Elmira after doing two and a half years on the three counts of aggravated assault I'd prosecuted him for. ‘Come over here, he called out. ‘Hey, I'm not going to kill you. In Fat Mikey’s world, that was not hyperbole but a promise; he got busy straightening his tie to demonstrate he was not concealing a Walther PPK. ‘I hear you're not working for the D.A. any more, he boomed. I strolled over, smiling to show I didn’t hold any grudges either, and offered my hand, which he shook in the overly vigorous manner of a man trying to show a professional woman that he’s comfortable with professional women. Then I handed him my business card. I was not unaware that Fat Mikey was one of three organized crime figures the cops routinely picked up for questioning on matters of Mob-related mayhem. To have Fat Mikey as a client was to have an annuity. He glanced down at my card to recall my name. Lee? Naturally, I didn’t respond ‘Fat?’ And to call him ‘Mike’ after having called him ‘a vulture feasting on society’s entrails’ in my summation might seem presumptuous. So I murmured a polite ‘Mmm?’ ‘A girl like you from a good family -’ ‘Are you kidding?’ I started to say, but he wouldn't let me. ‘I could tell you got class, watching you at the trial; he went on. “You know how? Good posture - and not just in the morning. Plus you say ‘whom: Anyways, you really think you can make a living defending guys like me?’ He didn’t seem so much sexist as sincerely curious. ‘This is what you had in mind when you went to law school?’ he inquired. ‘No. Back then I was leaning toward Eskimo fishing rights. But this is what I’m good at? He shook his head at my folly. ‘When a guy's ass is in a sling, you think he’s gonna hire a girl who says ‘whom’?’ ‘If he’s partial to his ass he will: Fat Mikey’s upper lip twitched. For him, that was a smile. Then, almost paternally, he shook a beefy index finger at me. ‘A girl like you should be more particular about the company she keeps. Years later, I would learn how wise Fat Mikey was. Nevertheless, from the beginning I knew there were limits to keeping bad company. I could be sympathetic to my clients without getting emotionally involved. A lot of them had had sad childhoods. Many had been victims of grievous social injustice, or of terrible parents (who were themselves victims of terrible parents). Still, I never forgot they were criminals. And while I may have delighted in a bad guy’s black humour, or a tough broad's cynicism, I was never one of those attorneys who got naughty thrills socializing with hoods. You’d never catch me inviting a client - let’s say Melody Ann Toth, for argument’s sake - to go shopping and out for meals so we could chitchat about old beaux ... or about what she might expect at her upcoming trial for robbing three branches of the Long Island Savings Bank on what might have been an otherwise boring Thursday. For their part, most of my clients (including Fat Mikey, who retained me two years after that conversation on the courthouse steps) wouldn't think I was exactly a laugh a minute either. Whatever their personal definition of a good time was, I wasn’t it. Unlike me, Fat Mikey simply did not get a kick out of crocheting afghans or listening to National Public Radio. With fists the size of rump roasts, Mikey looked like what he was: a man for whom aggravated assault was not just a profession but a pleasure. As for Mclody Ann, with her pink-blonde hair that resembled attic insulation, the only reason she'd go shopping at Saks would be to knock off the Estée Lauder counter when she ran out of lip liner. My clients had no reason or desire to try to pass for upper middle class. For that reason alone, Norman Torkelson was different right from the beginning. 31 When Fat Mikey shouted ‘Hey, girlie!’, the narrator Ahad a brief feeling of guilt about what she had previously done to him. B_ had difficulty in distinguishing what sort of mood he was in. C thought that it was impossible for him to be out of prison already. D remembered that he had been given a shorter prison sentence than expected. 32 The narrator gave Fat Mikey her business card because A she felt that he could be of advantage to her in her present job. visi B she felt that it would show that there was no bad feeling between them. C she wanted to behave in a way she thought appropriate for professional women. D she feared that there was a danger of him becoming aggressive. 33 What do we learn about Fat Mikey’s trial? A The narrator's use of ‘whom’ during it had struck Mikey as being inappropriate. B Mikey felt that her contribution at it had been crucial to the outcome. C The narrator’s description of him at it made it hard for her to treat him like a friend. D Mikey felt that her behaviour at it had been inappropriate for a woman. 34 When they talked about her suitability as a defender, A Mikey said that he did not think she would do well when defending certain people. B the narrator was puzzled as to what he meant by the advice he gave her. C Mikey felt that his comments on the subject might have offended her. D the narrator said that people who wanted to get out of trouble would employ her. 35 What does the narrator imply about some other attorneys? A They attracted criticism because of their relationships with some of their clients. B They paid too much attention to the unfortunate backgrounds of some of their clients. C They became friendly with some of their clients despite knowing that they shouldn't. D They weren't as interested in some of their clients as they pretended to be. 36 What does the narrator say about the majority of her clients? A Their personal appearance was important to them. B They committed crimes they were not likely to get away with. C They regarded her as something of a disappointment. D It would not occur to them to socialize with her."

    "text": "You are going to read an article. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the article. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. HELP GUIDE US THROUGH THE UNIVERSE Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, launches this year’s Young Science Writer competition. If you ask scientists what they’re doing, the answer won’t be ‘Finding the origin of the universe’, ‘Seeking the cure for cancer’ or suchlike. It will involve something very specialised, a small piece of the jigsaw that builds up the big picture. 37)______ So, unless they are cranks or geniuses, scientists don’t shoot directly for a grand goal – they focus on bite-sized problems that seem timely and tractable. But this strategy (though prudent) carries an occupational risk: they may forget they’re wearing blinkers and fail to see their own work in its proper perspective. 38)______ I would personally derive far less satisfaction from my research if it interested only a few other academics. But presenting one’s work to non-specialists isn’t easy. We scientists often do it badly, although the experience helps us to see our work in a broader context. Journalists can do it better, and their efforts can put a key discovery in perspective, converting an arcane paper published in an obscure journal into a tale that can inspire others. 39)______ On such occasions, people often raise general concerns about the way science is going and the impact it may have; they wonder whether taxpayers get value for money from the research they support. More intellectual audiences wonder about the basic nature of science: how objective can we be? And how creative? Is science genuinely a progressive enterprise? What are its limits and are we anywhere near them? It is hard to explain, in simple language, even a scientific concept that you understand well. My own (not always effective) attempts have deepened my respect for science reporters, who have to assimilate quickly, with a looming deadline, a topic they may be quite unfamiliar with. 40)______ It’s unusual for science to earn newspaper headlines. Coverage that has to be restricted to crisp newsworthy breakthroughs in any case distorts the way science develops. Scientific advances are usually gradual and cumulative, and better suited to feature articles, or documentaries – or even books, for which the latent demand is surprisingly strong. For example, millions bought A Brief History of Time, which caught the public imagination. 41)______ Nevertheless, serious books do find a ready market. That’s the good news for anyone who wants to enter this competition. But books on pyramidology, visitations by aliens, and suchlike do even better: a symptom of a fascination with the paranormal and ‘New Age’ concepts. It is depressing that these are often featured uncritically in the media, distracting attention from more genuine advances. 42)______ Most scientists are quite ordinary, and their lives unremarkable. But occasionally they exemplify the link between genius and madness; these ‘eccentrics’ are more enticing biographers. 43)______ There seems, gratifyingly, to be no single ‘formula’ for science writing – many themes are still under-exploited. Turning out even 700 words seems a daunting task if you’re faced with a clean sheet of paper or a blank screen, but less so if you have done enough reading and interviewing on a subject to become inspired. For research students who enter the competition, science (and how you do it) is probably more interesting than personal autobiography. But, if in later life, you become both brilliant and crazy, you can hope that someone else writes a best-seller about you. A. However, over-sensational claims are a hazard for them. Some researchers themselves ‘hype up’ new discoveries to attract press interest. Maybe it matters little what people believe about Darwinism or cosmology. But we should be more concerned that misleading or over-confident claims on any topic of practical import don’t gain wide currency. Hopes of miracle cures can be raised; risks can be either exaggerated, or else glossed over for commercial pressures. Science popularisers – perhaps even those who enter this competition – have to be as sceptical of some scientific claims as journalists routinely are of politicians. B. Despite this, there’s a tendency in recent science writing to be chatty, laced with gossip and biographical detail. But are scientists as interesting as their science? The lives of Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman are of interest, but is that true of the routine practitioner? C. Two mathematicians have been treated as such in recent books: Paul Erdos, the obsessive itinerant Hungarian (who described himself as ‘a machine for turning coffee into theorems’) and John Nash, a pioneer of game theory, who resurfaced in his sixties, after 30 years of insanity, to receive a Nobel prize. D. For example, the American physicist Robert Wilson spent months carrying out meticulous measurements with a microwave antenna which eventually revealed the ‘afterglow of creation’ – the ‘echo’ of the Big Bang with which our universe began. Wilson was one of the rare scientists with the luck and talent to make a really great discovery, but afterwards he acknowledged that its importance didn’t sink in until he read a ‘popular’ description of it in the New York Times. E. More surprising was the commercial success of Sir Roger Penrose’s The Emperor’s New Mind. This is a fascinating romp through Penrose’s eclectic enthusiasms – enjoyable and enlightening. But it was a surprising best seller, as much of it is heavy going. The sales pitch ‘great scientist says mind is more than a mere machine’ was plainly alluring. Many who bought it must have got a nasty surprise when they opened it. F. But if they have judged right, it won’t be a trivial problem – indeed it will be the most difficult that they are likely to make progress on. The great zoologist Sir Peter Medawar famously described scientific work as ‘the art of the soluble’. ‘Scientists,’ he wrote, ‘get no credit for failing to solve a problem beyond their capacities. They earn at best the kindly contempt reserved for utopian politicians.’ G. This may be because, for non-specialists, it is tricky to demarcate well-based ideas from flaky speculation. But it’s crucially important not to blur this distinction when writing articles for a general readership. Otherwise curious readers may take too much on trust, whereas hard-nosed sceptics may reject all scientific claims, without appreciating that some have firm empirical support. H. Such a possibility is one reason why this competition to encourage young people to take up science writing is so important and why I am helping to launch it today. Another is that popular science writing can address wider issues. When I give talks about astronomy and cosmology, the questions that interest people most are the truly ‘fundamental’ ones that I can’t answer: ‘Is there life in space?’, ‘Is the universe infinite?’ or ‘Why didn’t the Big Bang happen sooner?’"

Bettany Hughes digs deeper. A. Sharing breakfast with an award-winning author in an Edinburgh hotel a few years back, the conversation came round to what | was writing next. A book on Socrates,’ | mumbled through my muesli. Socrates!” he exclaimed. ‘What a brilliant doughnut subject. Really rich and succulent with a great hole in the middle where the central character should be.’ | felt my smile fade because, of course, he was right. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, might be one of the most famous thinkers of all time, but, as far as we know, he wrote not a single word down. Born in Athens in 469BC, condemned to death by a democratic Athenian court in 399BC, Socrates philosophized freely for close on half a century. Then he was found guilty of corrupting the young and of disrespecting the city’s traditional gods. His punishment? Lethal hemlock poison in a small prison cell. We don't have Socrates’ personal archive; and we don't even know where he was buried. So, for many, he has come to seem aloof and nebulous - a daunting intellectual figure — always just out of reach. B. But that is a crying shame. Put simply, we think the way we do because Socrates thought the way he did. His famous aphorism, the unexamined life is not worth living’, is a central tenet for modern times. His philosophies — 24 centuries old - are also remarkably relevant today. Socrates was acutely aware of the dangers of excess and overindulgence. He berated his peers for a selfish pursuit of material gain. He questioned the value of going to fight under an ideological banner of ‘democracy’. What is the point of city walls, warships and glittering statues, he asked, if we are not happy? The pursuit of happiness is one of the political pillars of the West. We are entering what has been described as ‘an age of empathy’. So Socrates’ forensic, practical investigation of how to lead ‘the good life’ is more illuminating, more necessary than ever. C. Rather than being some kind of remote, tunic-clad beardy who wandered around classical columns, Socrates was a man of the streets. The philosopher tore through Athens like a tornado, drinking, partying, sweating in the gym as hard as, if not harder than the next man. For him, philosophy was essential to human life. His mission: to find the best way to live on earth. As Cicero, the Roman author, perceptively put it: \"Socrates brought philosophy down from the skies.’ And so to try to put him back on to the streets he loved and where his philosophy belonged, | have spent 10 years investigating the eastern Mediterranean landscape to find clues of his life and the Golden Age of Athens’. Using the latest archaeology, newly discovered historical sources, and the accounts of his key followers, Plato and Xenophon, | have endeavoured to create a Socratesshaped space, in the glittering city of 500BC Athens - ready for the philosopher to inhabit. D. The street jargon used to describe the Athens of Socrates’ day gives us a sense of its character. His hometown was known as ‘sleek’, ‘oily’, ‘violetcrowned’, ‘busybody’ Athens. Lead curse tablets left in drains, scribbled down by those in the world's first true democracy, show that however progressive fifth-century Athenians were, their radical political experiment - allowing the demos (the people) to have kratos (power) - did not do away with personal rivalries and grudges. Far from it. In fact, in the city where every full citizen was a potent politician, backbiting and cliquery came to take on epic proportions. By the time of his death, Socrates was caught up in this crossfire. E. His life story is a reminder that the word ‘democracy’ is not a magic wand. It does not automatically vaporize all ills. This was Socrates’ beef, too — a society can only be good not because of the powerful words it bandies around, but thanks to the moral backbone of each and every individual within it. But Athenians became greedy, they overreached themselves, and lived to see their city walls torn down by their Spartan enemies, and their radical democracy democratically voted out of existence. The city state needed someone to blame. High-profile, maddening, eccentric, freethinking, free-speaking Socrates was a good target. Socrates seems to me to be democracy’s scapegoat. He was condemned because, in fragile times, anxious political masses want certainties — not the eternal questions that Socrates asked of the world around him."

Fundamental questions about human nature There can be no single, simple definition of human nature. Many inter-twining ideas in the history of philosophy have helped us to form our understanding of ourselves. Ideas of human nature radically affect the kind of society we live in and the kind we would like to live in. How far do we need society? Is it feasible to imagine living in splendid isolation? Linked to this is the question as to whether we are all naturally only concerned for ourselves, and only willing to cooperate with others when it is in our interests to do so. Are we, on the other hand, social beings by nature, eager to cooperate with others for the common good? The study of human nature Ideas about human nature are of their essence philosophical. They are not simply the result of scientifically established facts, but are general conceptions arrived at through rational argument. They are inevitably often controversial, but the theories produced determine our vision of ourselves. Most writing on the subject is explicitly philosophical. Since, though, philosophical assumptions about our nature lie at the root of any discipline concerned with the activities of men and women, it is not surprising that some thinkers have written primarily from the standpoint of another intellectual discipline. History, politics and social anthropology, to name only the most obvious, all proceed with some view about human nature. Write your essay."

Why animals like to play Play has been described as any form of behaviour that does not serve a function or purpose. The natural world abounds with such examples of animals playing just because they can. For instance, ravens in Alaska and Northern Canada have been observed sliding down roofs covered in snow. They slide down and then fly or walk back to the top of the roof to repeat the activity again and again. In some parts of America, ravens have been spotted slithering down shallow banks of snow, often with a small stick held in their claws. When I learned this, it immediately brought to mind when my children were young and I took them to the park. They exhibited exactly the same repetitive behaviour, happy to do the same thing for hour upon hour on the slides. Understanding why and how animals or birds play requires researchers spending hours watching them. They help us to explain what is often a mystery to humans – are they really playing or is it just part of their normal instinct to survive? Herring gulls are another example of birds that seem to play. Shellfish like clams make up their staple diet but they need to be opened to be eaten. To get inside, the herring gulls have to drop the clam onto a rock or another solid object if they drop it from the right height, the shell covering the clam will crack or break, giving them access to the clam inside. But sometimes, instead of letting the shell hit the ground, the herring gulls swoop down and catch them in mid-air. Other gulls have been seen to behave like this too, so the herring gulls’ activities are not unique. This is where systematic research is so important. More than eighty hours of observing herring gulls has led researchers to discover patterns – or what they term ‘rules’ of the ‘game’. They found that it is the younger, less mature gulls that play this game the most. They also noticed that it is frequently played over soft ground rather than hard, so they are not actually trying to break the shells. The young herring gulls also played with objects other than clam shells. Interestingly, the researchers realised that this dropping behaviour was seen more often when there was a strong wind. The researchers concluded that the gulls enjoyed the game more when there was an added challenge, in this case, the wind. What researchers are still uncertain about is if the gulls are simply having fun or if there is another explanation for their behaviour. Both the ravens and the herring gulls play alone, but social play is common in animals, especially in dogs. Dog owners love to take their canine friend for a walk, yet when they meet another dog, the dogs go through a ritual just like it was stage-managed. Nose to nose, they look at each other over, sniff one another and circle round the other dog. Then, more likely than not, they will start to fight. Neither dog gets hurt, because this is just a pretend fight, not the real thing. In other words, they are just play-fighting. This ritual has been described as ‘specific signal patterns’. Dogs, coyotes and wolves all display the same behaviour. It begins with the bowing of heads – the ‘play bow’ – and, like other signals, seems to send the message that they wish to play. Indeed, it serves another important function, too: it prolongs playtime. This might seem bizarre, but it prevents any confusion in other contexts, such as predatory or aggressive encounters. The psychologist, Marc Bekoff, observes that the bow that is used both before and after actions that could be misunderstood as non-playful. It appears that all age groups of dogs use the play bow – 74% of the time before and after pretend biting; young wolves 79% of the time and juvenile coyotes 92%. One theory is that the playful interaction between dogs might possibly be a form of practice for any future aggressive or competitive encounters. Their playtime prepares dogs to be more psychologically flexible, rather than to be aggressive from the moment they see a dog they have not previously met. Perhaps their playing serves no obvious survival purpose, and dogs and other animals just play to have a good time. Children though, also often play games that have a more serious purpose, as they enable them to understand their place in the social hierarchy they inhabit. It is, of course, entirely possible that exactly the same principle applies to animals and birds. 31 Why does the writer give the example of their children in the park? A) To express their wonder at bird behaviour. B) To help readers visualise what they are describing. C) To emphasise how playful birds are. D) To show how birds imitate humans. 32 According to the writer, herring gulls A) act in a way that is not exclusive to their breed. B) show a natural instinct to stay alive in the wild. C) throw clam shells to the ground from a great height. D) fail to eat any of the clams because the shells are unbreakable. 33 What has the researchers’ work revealed about herring gulls? A) They prefer to play games when the weather is calm. B) They have turned cracking clam shells into a game. C) They discovered the older gulls rarely joined in. D) They still do not know anything about them. 34 The writer says that when one dog encounters another, A) they imitate each other's movements. B) they continue walking together. C) they start to fight with each other. D) they behave in a fixed and expected way. 35 The writer refers to ‘specific signal patterns’ (line 29) to illustrate that they A) present dogs with the opportunity to fight. B) protract the predatory phase of the ritual. C) prevent dogs from misreading the situation. D) prove dogs have similar behaviour patterns. 36 What is the writer’s attitude towards animals and birds playing? A) He considers it plausible that through play they find their place in their community. B) He is uncertain how it contributes to research into why children play. C) He is convinced that there is a real reason for their behaviour. D) He doubts whether enough animal behaviour has been studied."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from an article Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract Choose from the paragraphs A - H the one which fits each gap (37 - 43), There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use.  Can a disguise fool surveillance technology? Just how good is surveillance technology today? Francesca Holt reports. When John McAfee took flight from Belize after his neighbour died from a fatal gunshot wound, he disguised himself to avoid detection. Border guards failed to recognise who he was and for a while he evaded capture. But surveillance technology have picked him out of the people crossing the border into Guatemala? 37)______ As a fugitive, McAfee coloured his hair and beard grey, put shoe polish on his face to darken his skin, made his cheeks bigger by padding them out with bubble gum and stuffed his right nostril to make it appear, as he put it, 'awkward, lopsided and with a disgusting appearance'. It might seem rather theatrical, but it worked and enabled him to escape. 38)______ However, McAfee would probably still have not been caught using today’s technology, as facial recognition technology is still not good enough to do the job. Some people have faces that are too ‘normal’ or common and would not need to disguise themselves at all. Jean-Luc Dugelay, a video surveillance expert in the French research institution, Eurecom, says, ‘Certain people have faces that just seem to be hard for computers to recognise. It’s difficult to know why and the faces that are hard to recognise vary from one recognition system to another. But if you have something that is close to the average face, then it will be harder for a computer system to recognise you.’ 39)______ Face detection often entails distinguishing significant 'intensity signatures' of light and dark spots on a representation that is typical of a human face. When people look to recognise each other, they go by an eye for a face, two eyes, and a nose between two eyes and the mouth. Computers, though, do not work the same way, as they are not looking for physical features. Instead, they look for a configuration of dark, light and dark in a horizontal line that matches to a line between the eyes. 40)______ This feature vector is basically a guideline for a face that can be compared with other similar feature vectors. The problem is that some human faces have comparable feature vectors and so ‘average’ faces are hard to separate and tell apart. The Eigenfaces system has to use the complete face to recognise someone. This flaw in the system means it is possible to conceal your true features from a recognition system by just pulling a face, frowning or smiling. This would not deceive a person, but it would technology. 41)______ It will not be possible to identify a fully covered face, but it is feasible to differentiate one face from another with between a third and half of the face covered. There has even been some success with just using a mouth for recognition, something that a human would be unable to do. 42)______ Surprisingly, research into the effects of rhinoplasty – or nose surgery – on facial recognition systems revealed that it has no significant effect on detection rates. That is on 2D systems. Experimental 3D facial recognition systems can be conned by rhinoplasty, as it changes the shape of the nose in three dimensions rather than two. 43)______ In spite of all the advances in technology, however, the vulnerability of current systems is the simple act of looking at your feet, rather than at the camera. Humans can identify someone they know from almost any angle, but facial recognition systems cannot unless the face can be clearly seen. Most surveillance cameras are usually mounted at least at eye level, if not higher, so looking down fully defeats them as every recognition system. A Not only would changing your facial expression hoodwink machines, but also draping a scarf over the mouth and nose, or even wearing dark glasses would work just as well. It will not work for much longer though, as new techniques are being developed that can take information from the nose or mouth alone if the eyes are covered, or from the eyes if the mouth and nose are concealed. B Then, once a face has been distinguished, there are varying ways in which to recognise it. One way is to generate what is called a ‘feature vector’ – a mathematical representation of the face. This is built up from pieces of hundreds of ‘standard faces’ in numerous proportions. These are known as ‘Eigenfaces’ and created by scrutinising thousands of real faces, using a procedure named ‘principal component analysis’. C It would also seem to make no difference if a fugitive wore a wig or glasses, as neither of these can fool a computer. Being discrete and trying to blend in with the crowds will also be futile, as facial recognition systems can scan hundreds of faces a minute. D All it seems to require in films is to wear a pair of glasses, cut and/or dye your hair and attach a fake moustache. Maybe a hat, too. This low-tech disguise never seems to fail in the movies. John McAfee adopted some of these techniques and met with success. When he was eventually apprehended it was not because his disguise had failed to convince but because he had allowed a reporter to print a photograph of him and the authorities realised where he was. E So how would John McAfee’s disguise succeed today? Despite darkening his skin, which would soften the intensity signature of his face, the light hitting contours of the face would still register an intensity signature that would enable face detection. Likewise, the alteration to the shape of his cheeks and nose would meet little success. F To appreciate the reasons for this, it is worth looking at how the majority of face recognition technology works. First, it has to realise that it is actually being presented with a face – a process called face detection – and then work on recognition and matching it with a face that is already in the system. G Equally, dying the beard and hair would be counterproductive these days, as computer systems look at a face from above the eyebrows down to the chin, so hairstyles and colour are irrelevant. Even if your beard was a metre long, it would make no difference. H However, it might not be so simple in the future. The FBI has unveiled its Biometric Identification Tools Program, with aspirations for the future to develop mobile facial recognition software, which would enable them to access records at any time, from anywhere around the globe. In the real world this means using the technology that is currently available from CCTV cameras in streets, sports stadiums, motorways, shopping centres, car parks and so on, anywhere on the planet, because it will be held on one database."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about four women who explain why they do the dangerous things they do. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–D). The sections may be chosen more than once. Which of the women: 44) was given encouragement by a family member? 45) says she remains calm in demanding situations? 46) has experienced physical symptoms of fear? 47) didn’t think much of the activity at first? 48) is frightened by one aspect of what she does? 49) avoided starting a new activity? 50) had a gradual introduction to what she does? 51) says it is important to focus on what she is doing? 52) wanted a change from her normal life? 53) was successful at a certain activity when young?  WOMEN WHO LIKE THE TASTE OF DANGER Ivy Viney asked four women what makes them do the things they do. A Marlee became a policewoman eight years ago, and has done a lot of work in undercover operations. ‘We had a careers talk at school about joining the police force, which interested me and I decided to apply. (44) To be sure that a life as a policewoman was really for me, I first signed up for the Specials, a group of part-time officers. I really liked the work so signed on the dotted line and became a full-time officer. After a couple of years I joined the Special Inquiry Section, which deals with robberies. I have to do a certain amount of undercover work, such as pretending to be a cashier in a bank about which we’ve received a tip-off that it might be robbed. Obviously, we’re dealing with criminals, some of whom are violent, so there’s already the element of risk. However, I have a back-up team that I have total confidence in, and therefore, I don’t really feel scared when I’m working undercover. It does frighten me when we have to do (48) a raid though, as we never know what we’re going to face when we walk into a room. That makes me more careful, and not being alone, makes me feel more confident. B During the week, Eva works in a shop making chocolate. However, at weekends she drives down to Dover, on the English Channel, where she trains to swim the thirty-five kilometre stretch of sea between England and France, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. ‘When I was young I kept winning (53) long-distance swimming events and eventually someone said to me, “Why not have a go at the Channel?” I thought I couldn’t do it and made excuses saying I couldn’t afford it. Then my friends started raising money to pay for me to try, so I had no choice but to do it. (49) When I got in the sea, I kept asking myself “What am I doing?” It was hard work and I was scared. (50) It finally took me 11 hours 21 minutes and I was told to try it again and do it a bit faster the next time! These days I swim the Channel mainly to raise money for children in hospital.’ C In 2007, although a mother of three small children, Katherine signed up for the Air Force because she saw it as a change from her domestic routine. (52) Her husband was already a pilot and urged her to join. (44) Katherine didn’t think the Air Force would accept her, but they did and she is now not only an Air Force pilot for her country but also flies small planes in competitions. ‘I’m quite a careful and cautious person and don’t think of what I do as dangerous because I always respect my limitations and those of the aircraft. The engine could fail, but that’s a risk I have to take. My worst and most scary moment was when I was flying home from a competition in France. The weather was awful, forcing me to fly lower and lower. My heart was racing, my mouth was dry, and my hands were sweating. (46) I had to turn back and find another airfield to land at. I also race cars and have often been more frightened doing that than flying.’ D Georgina gave up her career as a social worker to become a professional acrobatic parachutist. ‘I first tried parachute jumping in my teens, but didn’t particularly like it. (47) Then, in my mid-20s I visited the States and went on a jump with a friend. I was hooked straight away. I like being in the air and the freedom it gives me, and the fact that you can’t switch off — you really have to concentrate or you put the team in jeopardy. (51) I think I’m a level-headed and calm person, so I rarely panic in a difficult situation. (45) I have been in danger though. One time another member of the team jumped out of the plane too quickly, landed on me and knocked me out. Fortunately someone else saw it happen and grabbed hold of me. We landed together with me still unconscious, which is a very difficult manoeuvre. The accident damaged my confidence, but within weeks I was back jumping again.’"

Jodie goes to court It had been an uncertain last six months for Jodie where her own future and fortunes were concerned. She had had to rely on unemployment benefit since she had been sacked, although she had always felt her employer underpaid her for the amount of responsibility she had. Add to this working late every day, the extra hours unpaid, she had always felt hard done by. Now, however, after having to economise on everything, her salary felt like long lost riches, a blessing before her world had collapsed around her. Determinedly, Jodie had applied for other jobs. With equal regularity, Jodie’s applications were ignored. Occasionally she got lucky and was rewarded with an interview. Unfortunately, being a truthful person - though Jodie found irony in this statement - as soon as she mentioned she had been fired and explained the circumstances, she was shown the door. She could not bring herself to lie about it, because she was convinced she would be found out anyway. Protestations about her innocence were met with looks of incredulity by all of the prospective employers she saw. One had even muttered, ‘There’s no smoke without fire.’ Now she was literally facing her day in court. Jodie stood across the road from the impressive building, the bronze scales of justice on the roof glinting in the morning sun. Thoughts were swirling around her head and she realised how nervous she was. No, not nervous! Her over-riding emotion was fear. She was terrified. She had never set foot in a courtroom before, and here she was on trial for a crime she had not committed. Embezzlement was a sordid word to her mind and she had heard it ever since the two plain clothes detectives had knocked on her door one Friday evening and accused her of it. They had taken her to the police station, fingerprinted her, taken a statement and formally charged her. They had not been impolite, but it was quite obvious they had not believed anything she said. Jodie had immediately made an appointment with the family solicitor. Mr Hardcastle had known Jodie all her life, and to say the elderly man was shocked was an understatement. He spluttered and humph-ed for a few minutes, but then he was all business. He was a wise and clever man who asked her for every detail. He then engaged a lawyer who was steadily building a reputation as an astute court practitioner. Jodie had met him twice. The first time she had found him extremely intimidating. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Sir James Fitzgerald had attended Eton and Oxford, but was no wastrel. Despite his background, he was shrewd and intelligent, and seemed to thrive on the cut and thrust of a complex case. They had spent thirty minutes together, when he had made notes on her answers to his very pertinent questions. The second time, he had reassured her as he pointed out that his enquiries had proved that on at least four occasions when cheques had been forged, she had not been in the office. Her innocence on two of those occasions could be proved conclusively. One occasion had been when Jodie was hospitalised for minor eye surgery, and the other she had been at a conference in London. On the other two instances, she had been at subsidiary branches and although there were records of this, they were not official enough to stand up in court. She felt her shoulders relax when he relayed this information to her, but he followed this up by stating that if found guilty, she would most probably be imprisoned for at least a year. He had allayed some of her fears by pointing out that this was unlikely to happen, as it was her first offence. She had no criminal record. Jodie’s mother, Enid, had become quite argumentative when told this. ‘Just let the judge try. He’ll have me to answer to.’ Her attitude had taken Jodie by surprise and she had to strongly discourage her from attending court on the appointed day. The conversation flashed through Jodie’s mind, and she gave a wry smile. The day of reckoning was here. She looked both ways, crossed the road, and with a deep sign, entered the building. She spotted Sir James immediately, and with long confident strides that belied how she really felt, she approached him. ‘Ah, Miss Rogers, you’re here! I have some good news. The presiding judge is old Sturridge. He’s fair-minded and has never sent a woman to prison in all his time on the bench. I think we’re in for a good day. Today we will see your old boss sent to jail and you re-instated in your job, with your unblemished record again intact.’ 31 How does Jodie feel now about the sum she used to be paid? A) It had made her feel secure and valued. B) She was unwise to have given it up. C) It represented a fair payment for her work. D) She ought to have appreciated it more. 32 Jodie discovered that in job interviews A) explanations are unnecessary. B) determination is never enough. C) sarcasm is a good defence. D) honesty is not the best policy. 33 What made Jodie arrange to meet Mr. Hardcastle? A) She could rely on him as a family friend. B) She knew he would do his utmost to help her. C) She hoped he would be acquainted with a good lawyer. D) She was frightened by the visit of the two detectives. 34 What was Jodie’s first impression of Sir James Fitzgerald? A) She thought he lived up to his reputation. B) She felt he enjoyed being the bearer of bad news. C) She found him to be perceptive but daunting. D) She believed he had discovered relevant evidence. 35 It is suggested that Jodie’s mother, Enid A) understands nothing about the law. B) has low expectations of the judge. C) expects Jodie to go to prison. D) is aggressive and uncompromising. 36 The attitude of the lawyer towards Jodie shows that he has— A) facts about Jodie’s old boss. B) knowledge of what will happen. C) confidence in his abilities. D) faith in the judge’s experience."

    "text": "You are going to read a review of a film. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the review. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino’s return to form with a humourous western about slavery. Django Unchained, a virtuous but violent revenge western, debuts the bromcom pairing of Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, and is set against a background of the slave plantations in the south, two years before the Civil War. Many people expressed surprise that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, but this is certainly Quentin Tarantino’s best film since Pulp Fiction. 37) ______ Foxx is Django, a slave when the film opens, being walked through Texas in chains in bitterly cold weather. Here he has what can be described as either a fortuitous or a fateful encounter with Dr King Schultz (Waltz), an enigmatic, dapper German ex-dentist, who speaks impeccable English. Schultz, now a bounty hunter, frees Django, by killing the slave traders transporting him, giving us a first glimpse of the mayhem and violence to come. 38) ______ She is now a slave at the Mississippi plantation, Candieland, the property of the repulsive bigoted sadist, Calvin Candie, who is memorably brought to life on the silver screen by Leonardo DiCaprio. An unlikely partnership begins between Django and Schultz, as they set off on a journey to secure her freedom and in the process, exact Django’s retribution on Candie. 39) ______ The end of their journey is at the fiefdom of Calvin Candie, a charming aristocrat whose plantation is a symbol of oppression and corruption of the human spirit. DiCaprio’s Candie is a repugnant character, full of his own importance and Southern politeness, and a fully paid up racial supremacist. 40) ______ Candie’s pretence of being genial disguises a sadist who allows a man to be ripped limb from limb by rabid dogs as punishment. He is an enthusiast of ‘Mandingo’ wrestling – a fight to the death between slaves. The obscene humiliation of this is plain, yet its impact is lessened by the atmosphere of the men who hang around to watch the men die slowly. 41) ______ He employs his glare, language, and a tremor that suggests Parkinson’s disease, to bolster Candie’s abhorrent racism. It shocks to see an African American so vehemently supporting a white man who, despite the servant’s loyalty, would shoot him in an instant. 42) ______ The quandary for Tarantino in general – and Django in particular – is that of tone. The viewer is never quite sure about it. For instance, the scene where a menacing posse of masked Ku Klux Klansmen arrives to attack Foxx and Schwartz, deteriorates into farce when they start squabbling about the size of the eye-holes in their bagged masks. It is typical Tarantino to incorporate this back-and-forth dialogue, and that’s fine. But Tarantino has yet to determine a way to amalgamate humour with horror, which becomes quite extreme in the latter half of the film. 43) ______ Schultz’s way with words and his ability to hide behind the law are hugely enjoyable. He and Foxx were well cast as a hilarious double-act. But Tarantino’s flair and the fact that he has been brave enough to make a film about a subject that few American directors would dream of tackling, deserves admiration. The racism of the country’s past and its record on slavery might not be historically represented in the film, but he more than adequately gets his point across.  A Tarantino’s message of exploitation is such that some bad people commit repeated cruelty against the innocent. This sets the scene for retaliation, because the good downtrodden people and their associates have good reasons to take revenge. Their revenge is justified because they have been aggravated and mistreated. The more they have been assaulted, the more they merit the punishment. That way the audience feels happy and morally assured in the display of violence – after all, the victims deserve it. B He is impeccably dressed, but the overall impression is one of shabbiness, the same as his personality. He is fairly young, but seems middle aged and seedy. He has no qualms about abusing, maiming or killing his slaves, sometimes in the most brutal manner and takes pleasure in watching them suffer. C The film is to some extent based on the Django westerns of the 1960s, featuring Franco Nero, as well as the infamous Mandingo film of 1975. However, this fantastically outrageous version operates on its own terms – or perhaps Tarantino’s terms of violence – something of an impudent yet extremely humorous nightmare series of ever more violent events. D The film is worth a watch, being stylish and funny, brutal and superbly-acted, penetratingly written and highly offensive. Yet Tarantino does not seem to have the ability to know what to edit out of his films. The first hour flashes grippingly by but in the second hour the film starts to wander and take its time. At the end of the second hour an ending seems to be in sight, but a further three-quarters of an hour continues the bedlam with the audience squirming in their seats. E Despite an impeccable line up of stars, the one who outshines the rest and totally upstages them is Samuel L. Jackson, who gives the performance of his life as Stephen, Candie’s household attendant, a sort of Uncle Tom character, who is wholly and belligerently devoted to his master. F And so it ends fatally for the slavers, but Schultz has found his man, as Django agrees to help him hunt down three outlaws in exchange for his freedom. Bounty-hunting, Schultz explains, is ‘a flesh-for-cash business’, just like slavery. Django is also seeking his wife, a German-speaking slave named – to Schultz’s surprise – Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Like Django she was a runaway, and is branded on the face with a telltale R. G Tarantino makes all of this glaringly obvious and keeps reminding the viewer, something that only he and Jackson could have carried off in the Stephen character. It is cringe making when watched, especially when so few films in Hollywood deal with the subject of slavery, except from the point of view of abolition. Tarantino is more than willing to deal with the subject matter head on, warts and all. H In a surprisingly unpatronising manner, during their travels Schultz instils in Django a feeling of his own independence, concentrating his antagonism against those who have misused him, and showing Django why he should show them no mercy. The German teaches him such practical things as how to handle a gun and shoot accurately, how to read, as well as the more subtle arts of role-playing, being patient and also biding his time to take revenge."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about six young girls who have achieved success as designers while still in their teens. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections A–F. The sections may be chosen more than once. Which of the successful young girl: owes success to doing something on a whim? ______ (44) is considering expanding her business? ______ (45) hopes to become very wealthy? ______ (46) was inspired by something boring? ______ (47) makes things that are cheap, fashionable and practical? ______ (48) makes a link between her success and having to learn a skill? ______ (49) seems modest about her success? ______ (50) started a business for which she had no formal training? ______ (51) discovered her future career by accident? ______ (52) began her business because she had time on her hands? ______ (53). SIX YOUNG FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS Daniel Crawley speaks to six successful young girls. A Anala Patel – children’s clothes designer There’s no doubt that Anala is going to be a big name in the future. Her forte is children’s clothes that challenge the traditional. Her fabrics do not crease, are washable, and are not what children would usually wear. Their cut and their look is more like a high end fashion designer would make, yet they are inexpensive. ‘At my school,’ explains the 16-year-old, ‘we have to learn practical skills, such as sewing. We had to design and make something for a child, and I really took to it. Before I knew it, a chain store wanted my designs and I’m going to work full-time for them when I leave school. It’s so unreal when I see my name on the labels!’ B Katerina Stellas – shoe designer ‘I’m 18 and a shoe designer. Who’d have ever thought that would happen? Certainly not me!’ Katerina’s life has changed completely and despite her excitement, she seems remarkably calm about her sudden rise to fame. Her shoes can be seen everywhere and now she’s left school she’s devoting herself full-time to her new career. ‘I never dreamed something like this could happen. On impulse, I entered a competition So You Think You Could Do Better and I won. I love shoes, but could never find any that were really different and unique. Now I can, and so can every other teenager.’ Katerina has plans to design for all age groups and is surprisingly eager considering she’s already struck it rich. C Richenda Lefevre – website designer Richenda has no art training or real computer background, yet here she is, running her own business designing websites for large corporations, at the tender age of seventeen. ‘I built my own website when I was fifteen. You know, one of those free ones you can get. It was fun and I really got into all the different effects you could achieve. People started asking who had designed the site, and then my uncles asked for my help to set up their website for their business, and it just grew from there.’ Today, Richenda is revamping the websites of companies that deal primarily with teenagers, and she has more work than she can handle. She’s thinking of taking on staff – teenagers, of course! D Jemma Shuter – computer games designer Jemma had no interest in computer or video games until she was fifteen, when she played her first game with a friend. She talks now like she’s been doing it all her life. She found the game repetitive and dull and thought she could improve on it. She spent six months in the evenings and at weekends working on it, but didn’t really expect to sell it to anyone. ‘It was always just to prove I could do it. My dad approached a company and now that it’s on the shelves, it feels great! My friends all love it and have bought a copy. I’m working on another one now that’ll be even better. I hope I’m quite proud of it already!’ E Ivy Dawson – furniture designer ‘I was so thrilled when I saw the furniture I’d designed on display for everyone to see. All my ideas had come to life!’ When Ivy and her family moved to a bigger house, her parents said she could have new bedroom furniture. They searched everywhere but couldn’t find anything she liked. So Ivy made drawings of what she wanted and took it to the biggest department store in the area to ask if they could make it for her. They were so impressed with her designs that the 17-year-old is now working for them. ‘I had no idea what I wanted to do after I left school, so I found what I want to do purely by chance. I’m so happy!’ F Ellie Foxx – jewellery designer Ellie started to make her own jewellery when she was studying for her A levels to go to university. ‘I didn’t have to go to school every day, and I couldn’t study all the time. Without much money, I bought some beads and the other stuff I needed.’ Ellie posted pictures of what she’d made on a social website to show her friends. They all wanted some. ‘I didn’t expect anything like this. Despite getting into university, I’ve decided to concentrate on the jewellery making. I sell it online and am sending out over a thousand orders a week. My goal is to make my first million by the time I’m twenty-one, so two years to do it.’"

(1) It’s more economical to rent Renting a property can be the most cost-effective choice if you are not planning to stay in one area for any length of time, and involves much less risk. It is much cheaper to move if you rent; selling a house is time consuming and expensive. In addition, a tenant is not responsible for maintenance and repairs and the landlord also has to insure the property, so the tenant saves even more money.

It makes financial sense to buy For the majority of people, buying a home is preferable to renting. After all, owning your own property is viewed as one of life’s great achievements, while also providing stability and security. Another huge benefit of owning a property is that instead of paying rent each month to a landlord – money you will never see again – you are investing the monthly mortgage payment in your future.

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article. For Guiestions 31- 36, needs hed answer (A, B C or D) which you think fits best  according to the text . Young People’s Love Affair with Mobile Phones Roger Paire is a specialist researcher who looks at why young people seem addicted to mobile phones One thing Roger Paire cannot stand to listen to is the old excuse that young people were brought up with mobile phones and know no different. ‘This is simply not true. They weren’t born with a mobile phone in their hand!’ He is steadfast in his belief that young people are no more instinctively adroit at using a mobile phone than any other age group. ‘All they’re basically doing is socialising. Add to this peer pressure to have the latest phone and the know-how to use all the apps on it and you have the main reasons they appear to be more proficient — they use them more often.’ It’s understandable that Paire gets annoyed about this. He was the first to study the effect of mobile phones on people, especially the young. He’s been known to speak out vociferously against certain fictions that have grown up around the use of them. He’s concentrated particularly on clarifying the many reasons why the young rely on mobile phones so heavily, having taken a much closer look at the situation than any other researcher. His most recent research has been about why youngsters send so many text messages, especially in the evening, to people they have been with all day. ‘It’s not just a case of communicating information,’ explains Roger. ‘It’s more subtle than that. For example, six out of ten girls text their female friends, just to say “Hello”, whereas less than half of boys do the same. Some kids send up to fifty text messages a day because they see them as functional and efficient. It’s the whole convenience of them — they sort of fit into those small gaps you have in your day when you have a few minutes with nothing to do.’ Paine also investigated how teenagers manage to send so many text messages a day when they are in school for so many hours. ‘That’s easy to explain. Teenagers always try to get round the rules and defy teachers, despite the bans on mobile phones in the classroom; a ban I might add, that’s imposed by adults. It confirmed for me how important texting is to teens, and really it’s still passing notes in class, but via digital means.’ Roger’s research also confirmed that teenagers make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages. Older people are more likely to do the opposite, with an actual call being seen as more personal than a text message. Youngsters mainly make or receive calls from their parents, but texts rule when it comes to contacting their peers. Most young people are constantly connected to the Internet and Facebook through their mobile phone. The constant updating of their friends’ status seems to be irritating and unnecessary to many, but for teens it’s vital, especially as regards their close friends. ‘They also see their mobile phone as a constant companion,’ says Roger. ‘It’s become an extension of their body. Meet a teenager and you’ll meet their mobile phone! It’s sort of glued to them.’ (line 27) Most teenagers I spoke to sleep with it on their pillow or right next to the bed, they eat with it on their lap or by the plate, it goes to the bathroom with them and lies beside them when they have a shower. You’ll find that older people aren’t this enamoured of their phone, and will, for example, leave it downstairs when they go for a shower.’ Next time you’re in a café or restaurant where there are young people, have a good look at them to see how they’re interacting. Every one of them will be playing with their mobile phone, either reading or sending a text message, playing a game on it, checking their online status or just playing with and touching the phone. ‘They seem to be totally oblivious to the fact that they’re doing it,’ Paire observes, ‘and they do it while they’re communicating with the people they’re sitting with. Nobody seems to get upset by the fact that the others are paying more attention to their mobile phones instead of living in the present.’ Paire adds, ‘I did start to wonder if they ever turn their mobile phones off, and thus socialise in real time, so to speak. There doesn’t appear to be any sort of code among them as to when the mobile phone is intrusive or when it is rude or inappropriate to use it. In fact, teenagers refer to their mobile phone as “a device”, a device not only for communication, but also a clock, a music player, a camera, a link to the internet and social media, and a vital and indispensable part of their life.’ (line 39).31 What point does Roger Paire make in the first paragraph about mobile phones? A) They are the new form of social communication for all age groups. B) They form a fundamental part of young people’s social interaction. C) They are not thought of as something to be used by older people. D) They have become a way of teaching young people how to be social. 32 In the second paragraph, what is said about Paire’s research into the use of mobile phones? A) He has investigated several myths about them. B) It has focused on people’s attitudes towards mobile phones. C) It has been a collaborative process with other researchers. D) It has revealed the reasons why there are so many users. 33 The sentence ‘It’s more subtle than that.’ (line 13) refers to Paire’s view that A) today’s teenagers like to annoy teachers just like previous generations B) texting is an undemanding way to stay constantly in touch with friends C) teenagers’ attitudes to text messaging are similar to those of adults D) teachers tend not to respect teenagers’ need to pass notes to each other 34 The phrase ‘glued to them’ (line 27) means that Paire A) understands why teenagers cannot bear to be parted from their phone B) feels that for young people mobile phones are indispensible C) regards himself as someone who must always carry a mobile phone D) believes more research on mobile phone companionship is needed 35 What point is Paire making about young people in social situations? A) How important it is for them to check their text messages B) How they do not realise their behaviour is discourteous C) How unaware they are of not socialising with their friends enough D) How easy it is for others to misinterpret their behaviour 36 Paire uses the word ‘device’ (line 39) to emphasise the view that A) young people have unrealistic expectations about mobile phones B) teenage mobile phone users have no control over themselves C) his research has helped to reveal what the young really think D) teens see mobile phones as encompassing everything they need "

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about friendships . Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A - H the one which fits each gap (37 - 43). There is one extra   paragraph which you do not  need teo use. How and why do we choose our friends? The way we choose our friends is much more complicated than we realise, and probably not very moral. Plato wrote, ‘similarity begets friendship’ in his play Phaedrus, and Aristotle, along the same lines, wrote, ‘some define it as a matter of similarity,’ they say that we love those who are like ourselves. 37) __________ Social psychologists, however, have finally uncovered the fact that people do not retain a list of who owes them a favour or who they owe a favour to, in their head. Primatologist, Joan Silk, expressed the conundrum of friendship as ‘reciprocity and equity are important to human ends, but tit-for-tat reciprocity is antithetical to the formation and maintenance of close friendships’. If these seemingly contradictory claims are correct, then friendship presents a puzzle for evolutionary analysis. 38) __________ The scientists concentrated their research on blacktip reef sharks, whose habitat is coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They discovered that specific sharks favoured the companionship of certain others, and that their friendship continued over time. Other sharks, however, avoided each other at all costs, even if their feeding grounds coincided with each other. It would seem that geographic or territorial closeness are inadequate to clarify the reasons why one is a friend and another a foe. 39) __________ However, Australian researchers have found a third level of social hierarchy – a sort of super group that contained dolphins who were not related. Just like human relationships, this arrangement cannot be explained by reciprocity. For instance, a group of dolphins the scientists named PD triumphed over a second group, the KS set, on five different occasions. The dolphin social hypothesis would suggest that the two groups would never collaborate together, but researchers were shocked to see exactly that when a third group, called WC, attacked KS. The PD group entered the fray to help their one-time arch-rivals defeat this third group. 40) __________ Politics also plays a major part in forming friendships amongst the male Assamese macaque monkeys that are found in Thailand. A very social primate, domination is the only way for them to succeed with the female macaques. Failure to dominate leads to them slipping down the reproductive ladder into insignificance. 41) __________ So could the protection of one’s reputation be the answer to the friendship mystery instead of similarity as Plato and Aristotle believed, or reciprocity as evolutionary biologists have theorised? A Whenever there is a problem understanding anything to do with evolution, it is time to look to the animal kingdom for help. Shark scientists from France researched whether groups of sharks stayed together for social reasons, such as friendship, if they just stayed together because their range intersected or if there was a common food supply. B Forming a friendship based on having the same ideas, tastes or outlook on life might appear to be obvious and instinctive, but that instinct is misleading. The majority of friendships are cultivated between people who are not related or romantic partners, so friendship cannot be accounted for on a genetic or reproductive basis. Rather, evolutionary biologists have usually depended on a ‘you help me and I’ll help you’ scenario, called reciprocal altruism to rationalise the bonds of friendship. C When the participants believed that their point system would be made public, they apportioned the points evenly between all their friends, with ten points being the average. Yet when they were informed that their point division would remain a secret, the number of points awarded to each person was very different. Their best friend got the lion’s share of the points, followed by the next best friend, and so on. D It would seem that dolphin relationships are not established because of earlier dealings, but are based on political motives. Mutual decisions are centred on who else is there at the time. Despite the PD and KS groups having been adversaries, their common animosity towards the WC group turned them into temporary allies. E The non-family relationships that abound in the animal kingdom are very like friendships, according to Dr. Crockford. F One male macaque monkey was studied in 2010. At the beginning of the research, he was third in the group, yet in spite of his good physical condition and large size, he seemed unable to bond with the other male monkeys. He soon dropped to sixth in the group and before long, had tumbled still further to eighth, losing all reproductive advantage. G DiScioli and Kurzban, who conducted this experiment, give a political example to demonstrate the complicated realities of friendship, and not just simple economic or geographic reasons. Their case in point is that although China has traded with America over three times more than with Britain in the past, Britain is more likely to be termed a ‘friend’ of America rather than China. DiScioli concludes that friendship cannot be based on ‘an exchange of benefits’. H This research did not provide many answers, so science next looked to dolphins for help. Dolphins, just like some other non-human primates like chimpanzees, are typified by two levels of social hierarchy: a set of two or three males who work as one to safeguard the females from the attentions of other males, and larger sets who work together to entice females from other groups. By and large, the dolphins within each group are related, so they could perhaps co-operate because of shared genes or family selection."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about historical re-enactments. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–E). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section does the writer mention 44 a near accident during practice? 45 the idea that archery can be good for fitness? 46 a wish to emulate the success of someone else? 47 the composition of the re-enactment society? 48 the idea that tuition is absolutely necessary? 49 an explanation for becoming a member? 50 a lack of proficiency compared to some others? 51 reviving the past? 52 the suggestion that participants had been assessed? 53 the hierarchy of the society? KNOW YOUR HISTORY Tom Bales tries his hand at historical re-enactment. A There’s no half-way with archery. You either pick it up quite quickly or fail miserably to hit the target, despite practising for so long that your arms and shoulders feel like they’re on fire. Mastering the art though, is well worth the effort. It doubles as an excellent way of exercising and tightening up those arm and neck muscles and it’s the coolest way to really learn what it was like for those archers of old, although they of course were fighting for their life rather than a weekend’s re-enactment with other enthusiasts. You’re more involved with history than just reading a book or watching a film, and there’s a lot more to it than just trying to use a bow and arrow with some semblance of aplomb. B Happily practising with a group of people who are just as inept as you can be very amusing, even though it’s mandatory. The instructor, James Montgomery, has the patience of a saint and I first met him at a range in London. As I struggled to pull the bow back for the first time, he explained how he’d left his job in advertising to teach full-time. He teaches the re-enactors, as well as anyone who wants to learn how to become an archer. Impressed by how well-organised the re-enacting society are, he became one of their bowmen himself. He can, of course, fire off an arrow much quicker than anyone else, but everyone seems keen to build up to his speed. C The Great Northwood Bowmen, the re-enacting group, are a medieval archery and re-enactment society. Based in London, they focus on archery in the 14th and 15th centuries, providing a unique attraction in exciting and varied shows for their audiences. What makes this group so special is they are a hierarchical family unit. At the ‘head’ of the family are the nobility, which includes the Neville / Plantagenet family, along with characters such as Sir Edward Northwood. Then there is ‘The Retinue’, the longbow army with roles such as Sergeant Bill Bowman, who protects the Neville family. Finally, there are the ‘Household Staff’, who are cooks, textile craftsmen and women, peasant dancers and archers. D After a few weekends practising, which were fairly uneventful apart from nearly killing one of my fellow 44 learners with a wayward arrow, I was deemed ready for the first event of the month, the Knights in Combat Show. ‘It’s a few hours of marching and firing and then we’ll all have a feast when we win,’ James explained. ‘Just be careful and enjoy yourselves. This is what you’ve been working for and it’s supposed to be fun.’ We all grinned a bit sheepishly and set off. It was soon clear that I wasn’t the worst archer in the world, but there were others who were far more advanced than me. When the woman next to me and I were both ‘killed’, we lay on the grass chatting. She’d joined the re-enactment society as a means of relaxing. ‘I work long hours,’ she said, ‘and I hoped to get away from anything to do with work and meet people who aren’t doctors who talk shop all the time.’ It struck me as ironic that we were supposed to be dead and yet she was a doctor. E When the show had finished, we ate what seemed to be a banquet cooked by the other members who don’t do archery, and mingled together. What struck me the most was that everyone seemed to have got a lot out of the afternoon. My son came running up to me, ‘Dad that was so much fun.’ This was the reason I’d joined the re-enactment society. He hated history lessons at school, and I thought it would be a great way to make history come alive for him, but I think inadvertently it has helped me, too. Both of us have got out of the house more than once for the society, we talked about what we’d learned and upcoming events, and what part we’d play in them. He was now really into being a part of a Knight’s household, and all that it involved. We drove home together through the streets of London, talking about the castle we’d be staying in all next weekend and what parts we’d have to play in the re-enactment, excited and full of anticipation of what was to come."

    "text": "You are going to read a review of a recent book. For questions 31–36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Donna Pilkington reviews Anthony Robins’ book ‘Grand Central Terminal’ ‘People who come to New York should enter a palace at the end of their ride and not a shed’ was noted on the 1869 approval for the proposed Grand Central Terminal in New York. ‘The stranger who visits us for business or pleasure should be impressed by the magnificence of the great city upon his very entrance within its limits.’ And in most people’s opinion, the palace still stands today, described lucidly and gracefully by Anthony Robins in his book ‘Grand Central Terminal: 100 years of a New York Landmark’, written to celebrate its centenary in 2013. Robins begins his delightfully written tour and history outside the building, on East 42nd Street. He marvels at the façade, which boasts huge sculptures by Jules-Félix Coutan. The French sculptor created what at the time of its unveiling was considered to be the biggest sculptural group on the planet. It is forty-eight feet high and the clock in the middle is thirteen feet round. It portrays Mercury in the centre flanked by Hercules and Minerva, symbolising transportation and trade. Mercury is the patron god of travellers, commerce and financial gain, so an apt choice as the centrepiece of the building. Back inside, Robins describes the huge, 12,000 square foot Vanderbilt Hall, named after the family who financed the station’s construction. It used to be full of wooden benches provided for those waiting to begin their journey on a long-distance train. Today, this grandiose area, complete with sparkling chandeliers each weighing several tons, looks like a vast ballroom. For a while in the Seventies and Eighties the benches were used as beds by the hundreds of homeless people who descended on the station when they had nowhere else to go. Anthony moves on to the main concourse and the vast zodiac ceiling. He describes it as ‘breathtaking’ and writes, ‘Call it psychology, call it spiritual, it opens you up inside… especially in a dense city like New York. Imagine you’ve just got off a train. You’ve had a long ride and you’re tired, you pick up your bags and you walk out of the gate. You put your bags down and go “Wow!” Just the effect that Whitney Warren – the architect – wanted.’ The French artist, Paul Cézanne Helleu, designed the ceiling and was adamant that electric light bulbs, a major innovation at the time, be used for the twinkling stars. His interpretation of the zodiac is inaccurate, but restoration saw it faithfully returned to its former glory and Anthony is at pains in his book to point out that no one seems concerned that it is incorrect – they just admire its beauty. Robins explains that Grand Central is nearly all slopes and ramps, apart from the two grand staircases, styled on those in the Paris Opera House. Anthony writes rather enthusiastically about the slopes and the way gravity produces movement and circulation. As he writes, ‘The floor is mad at us – it wants us to get moving!’ Robins returns to explore further the right staircase with its Italian marble water fountain beneath it. He describes how ornate it is, encumbered with acorns and oak leaves and tells the reader that the Vanderbilts were without a family crest, but Cornelius Vanderbilt often quoted the saying ‘From little acorns mighty oak trees grow’, and so used the emblems in structures he funded. Anthony graphically describes the arrivals area, building an image in your mind of people of years past waiting for their loved ones to disembark from a train. Known as the ‘kissing gallery’, the original board where the arrival times of trains were chalked up, is now behind protective glass, forever frozen in time. A news stand now occupies most of this space, but despite the time Anthony says it takes to find it, he believes it is worth stopping to have a peek at. In fact, Robins claims there are many ‘secret’ areas of the station that passengers rushing through fail to see, yet they are hidden in plain sight. When reading Robins’ book, he often brings to mind Eric Hobsbawm, one of the most gifted and fearless historians of the 20th century, who with a wonderful way with words and a marvellous sense of timing. With Robins guiding the reader through the history of Grand Central, bringing to life the important individuals who conceived, financed and struggled to preserve it during the 1970s, this iconic building becomes so much more than just a train station. Just as Hobsbawm’s ‘history of the long nineteenth century’, as he called it, became a multi-volume reference masterpiece, so Robins’ tome will be seen as the benchmark book on the station. Grand Central Terminal is indeed a palace, the Queen of New York City. It deserves to live on in majestic splendour to celebrate its centenary with as much pomp as it did in 2013. 31. What point is being made in the first paragraph? A) Construction of Grand Central Terminal began in 1869. B) The building should have an impact on visitors to the city. C) Landmarks are only astounding if they are huge in size. D) The author has failed to do justice to the building’s description. 32. In describing the outside of the station, the reviewer claims that A) the embellishment can be oppressive if it is too large. B) it is adorned by the largest group of statues in the world. C) some of the façade is plain and without any ornamentation. D) the sculpture’s middle statue was an appropriate selection. 33. Anthony Robins thinks the architect’s vision for the zodiac ceiling A) achieved its objective in being so eye-catching. B) provides an opportunity for travellers to relax. C) was fulfilled by using electricity to highlight it. D) depicts an erroneous view of the heavens. 34. What point does the example of the Vanderbilt’s lack of family crest illustrate? A) What their family background was. B) How important a family crest is. C) How easy it is to invent one for oneself. D) How it is not necessarily needed to succeed. 35. What is the reviewer’s opinion of Robins’ section on the arrivals area? A) The area is no longer as evocative as it once was. B) His description makes it easy to imagine. C) He is right to focus on parts of the station that people miss. D) It is exactly the same as it was many years ago. 36. In the final paragraph, why does the reviewer refer to Eric Hobsbawm? A) To suggest that Robins was not as good an author. B) To compare the two writers’ fondness for history. C) To indicate how important Robins’ book is. D) To point out the importance of taking history into account."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article about ‘earworms’ – tunes that stay on our mind. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Why do catchy tunes stay on our minds? Claire Wilson reveals why the brain finds it hard to forget irritating, popular songs. Songs that go round and round in your head for days or even weeks on end, have commonly become known as ‘earworms’. For no obvious reason, a tune just stays on your mind, and you cannot help singing or humming it whether it’s a song you like or not. What is interesting about this experience is that it clearly illustrates a part of our mind that is not under our control. 37 __________ Oliver Sacks, a neurologist and author of the book Musicophilia, claims that earworms are an obvious sign of ‘the overwhelming and at times, helpless, sensitivity of our brains to music’. Music has something in common with earworms; they are both typified by reiteration, and this may be why earworms are so difficult to oust from our mind. 38 __________ Along with the repetition, music is unique compared to many of the other things we frequently encounter in our daily lives, because it is so similar every time we hear it. Roads are tedious to our eyes, and often all look the same, but each time you see the same road, you’ll see it from a different angle, aspect or in a different light. 39 __________ A further thing about earworms is that time and again they seem to have something appealing or untypical about them. Usually they are simple and repetitive fragments of music, but those songs that eventually become earworms have just a small trace of something that makes them ‘catchy’. 40 __________ Earworms also seem to be a part of long-term memory and not just a temporary after image of sound. For example, someone with an especially lasting earworm can activate it just by hearing someone mention the name. They don’t actually have to hear the music before it’s back again going through their head. 41 __________ One part of the slave system is the ‘mind’s eye’, which retains visual information, and another is the ‘inner ear’, which we, for instance, employ to remember someone’s address or phone number. It is the latter which appears to get weighed down with earworms. 42 __________ Freud claimed that our minds are not one unity, and today’s cognitive neuroscience agrees, though it varies on some of the specifics. The point is that our awareness of ourselves is far from being the only thing teeming in our minds. The mind is a place of which we do not have total control nor complete knowledge. 43 __________ One psychologist has proposed singing other songs that are quite similar to your earworm, using the theory that an earworm continues to exist in your mind because of its idiosyncrasy and your inner ear. By wiping out the individuality of the memory that is the earworm, either it will disappear or be replaced by yet another earworm. A Earworms are musical memories that get set in a loop and play a specific verse or line, over and over again and never get to the end of the song. A few people have said that if they sing the earworm to the very end, it can help stop it playing in your head. However, others have reported this is absolutely no help at all, and in fact might make it worse by more of the song rather than less being repeated mentally. B Maybe that is the reason why they haunt our memory, and are so difficult to forget. If they were the normal run of the mill song, they would be drummed out by all the other tunes that sound so similar to each other and we’d have no grounds to mark them out as different. C Yet this is not the complete story. Aptly named ‘slave systems’ have been pinpointed in our short-term memory by human memory researchers; sections of the mind that ensnare sights and sounds, keeping them to the forefront of our minds while we focus exclusively on them for a short time. D There is, of course, the infamous ‘don’t think of a white bear’ predicament. As it implies, the idea is not to think about a white bear, but just try it for yourself. You face the irony of attempting to block your mind of all thoughts of a white bear whilst at the same time confirming you are not thinking of a white bear – you are conjuring up an image of precisely the thing you are trying not to think of. So the only solution is to do something else to circumvent both thinking of the white bear and not thinking of the white bear. Something like the inner ear, really. "

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a book about changing technology. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–E). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section are the following mentioned: 44 the ability to type without touching a keyboard? 45 the possibility that the mouse will become obsolete? 46 instructions being carried out using signals? 47 the potential to complete a task using something other than a computer? 48 the global contrasts and aspects of different cultures? 49 an item of technology that virtually no longer exists? 50 the prediction that computer screens will become less widely used? 51 visual instructions are all that is needed? 52 there are many new technologies planned for the future? 53 certain actions are not suitable for a work environment? THE CHANGING FACE OF TECHNOLOGY The end for keyboards and mice? A Over the past few decades, technology, particularly the computer, has had an effect on all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the computer has expanded its capabilities in the realm of what it can do for humans through connection to the Internet. It brings us images and news from all corners of the world, images of distant parts of the solar system, social media opportunities, the chance to buy products from anywhere on Earth, an infinite number of facts at our fingertips, as well as being the means of capturing any aspect of life around the world. Yet despite the technology for computers and the Internet changing on practically a daily basis, throughout it all they have relied heavily on the keyboard and mouse. Indeed, with a few noteworthy exceptions, it is noticeable just how little the way we interact with computers has changed over the years. The keyboard and mouse may, however, be about to be made redundant, as there are a host of new ideas in the pipeline to simplify the way we use a computer. B Already the widespread use of touchscreen technology has started to erode the use of the keyboard, but not entirely. One new idea on the drawing board is to incorporate technologies that already exist, such as screens and computers, into everyday objects. This is known as ‘tangible computing’ and would allow anyone to cooperate with computers using physical things, rather than through a device such as a keyboard. For instance, you could specify which move you want to make on a chessboard to a computer, by physically moving a piece on a real board. This would negate the need to use the mouse or keyboard to enter your move. Researchers at MIT are already exploring other uses of this idea, putting forward plans to control on-screen experiences by manipulating real life things, and they are also prophesying wider use of flat surfaces, like tabletops or walls, being used as display screens or by using personal projectors worn on clothing or around the neck. C Gamers are already used to manipulating their games consoles with physical movements, particularly with games such as Microsoft’s motion-sensing device that follows the movement of objects in three dimensions using a camera and a depth sensor. This is not totally a futuristic concept, although it seems unlikely that office workers will want to be using extravagant arm movements to communicate with their computer. Most people are too lazy to use sweeping arm gestures all the time, so would return to using the mouse or would prefer to communicate with their laptop through their voice or tiny finger movements. The latter idea has already been incorporated into a 3D motion sensing system that is placed in front of a computer and lets users surf the web, play games or use other software with just finger and hand gestures. This gadget is already on sale, so not a vision that is pie in the sky, but actually possible and available. D Also available are systems that trace eye movements, already used by people with disabilities. Functions comprise controlling wheelchairs and are a means of using a keyboard instead of typing. Many scientists believe that tracking interfaces will become common, so that if you look in a particular direction or at a particular thing, it would be the signal for certain information to appear on the computer screen. E The last few years have witnessed the ever-increasing influence of the mobile phone and tablets, culminating in the decrease in sales of personal computers and laptops. For computers, the new prospects and uncertainties posed by tablets and their touchscreen tools, and the ability to carry out an ever-increasing variety of tasks, might have already sounded the death knell for the keyboard and mouse. It has even been suggested that we are now entering the post-laptop era – the personal computer has already been superseded by the laptop. However, for the moment it might be best to keep your qwerty keyboard at least, but it would seem that the mouse might be soon as extinct as the dodo."

The smell when you first enter the shop, the colours and choice surrounding you, the sorting through rails and shelves to find that elusive item of clothing that is going to look perfect on you.

Shopping From My Armchair My friends and I consider actually going to the shops to be very twentieth century. We buy everything online and simply send anything that doesn’t fit back. I could shop twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year, if I could afford to. I don’t have to buy petrol, pay for parking and I save time.

Facebook: Are some ‘likes’ worth more than others? Billy Mae investigates the social media giant’s recent addition: the search function. Are all Facebook users created the same or will some now find it too easy to beat the system for personal gain? Facebook’s Graph Search facility raised two questions: can I make money from it, and can it threaten Google? As regards the second question, part of the answer is that what Facebook appears to have created is the world’s first pioneering social search function. (line 3) A search engine like Google provides links, but Graph Search actually provides answers. Mark Zuckerberg explains, ‘Search engines are designed to take any open-ended question and give you links that might have answers. Graph Search is designed to take a precise query and give you an answer, not give you links that might provide the answer’. (line 7) The answers will come directly from a user’s social graph of friends. All they need to do is type in a question, such as, ‘People I know in Australia who eat chocolate and have visited Chicago’, and a list they can sort through will come up based on that criteria. It is also possible to explore what their friends have been doing, what they are interested in doing and how they appraise these experiences. The opportunities that Graph Search provides are endless, both to advertisers and Facebook users alike. (line 12) For lovelorn users who want to find that special someone, all they need to do is search for something like, ‘Single people who like Ancient history’. Facebook has, in effect, turned its data into an unparalleled chance for social discovery, showing us the future of the Internet and proving it is now really fully assimilated into daily life. (line 15) In the past, the majority of Internet users were anonymous when they used online services. Searching for an item or person was impersonal and the responses were based on global trends and the cumulative study of other Internet users. It would seem that companies like Google misjudged how much users want to make the whole experience more personal. People want to know who the information comes from rather than its popularity, and even if this information is from a celebrity rather than the man down the road, it is still of more interest to most of us. (line 17) Elise Ackerman, in her analysis of Graph Search for Forbes, realised that not all users are created equal and the more anonymity of the virtual world is substituted for the real world of friends, status, fame and followers, the more this disparity becomes an entrenched element of people’s daily digital living. Facebook is, in effect, feeding this inequality and assisting everyone to utilise their specific qualities for all they are worth. To answer the other question it’s going to be simple to make money from this new facility? Well, have you been to a shop where the service was excellent, the prices reasonable and there was a wide choice of whatever they sell? Then write a good review of the place so that you will get money off next time you shop there. ‘What if you have never been to that shop? No problem. Earn cash by stating that you have been there and loved the experience. Tell all your “friends” and followers on Facebook and the cash will roll in.’ (line 34) Facebook’s Graph Search will not necessarily be a success, nor only a way for making money and being able to find an audience for what you have to say. It is, however, an indication of a blossoming digital culture that stems from real lives and places. Facebook, like any other business, wants to keep its clients happy by giving them what they want. They also want the public to get it when they want it and from whomever they want it. In effect, the public have been recruited as reviewers, self-promoters, broadcasters and publicists and the public are lapping it up. (line 34) The drawback, voiced by Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski in November 2011, is what enticements this places on our relationships. ‘We have a name for the kind of person who collects a detailed, permanent dossier on everyone they interact with, with the intent of using it to manipulate others for personal advantage,’ he observed. ‘We call that person a sociopath.’ Perhaps Ceglowski’s words are less a prophecy and more of a warning, but they should be taken seriously. The Internet these days is becoming progressively more out of balance. Our relationships and approval of different things alike are services that we can sell. Utilising our sociopathic tendencies has never been easier to do or more enticing. (line 36) Nonetheless, whether it is making money or friends or not, finding your true love or not, some things just are not worth doing. Not if you want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror in the morning with a clear conscience, anyway.  31. What is the writer suggesting in the first paragraph about Facebook’s Graph Search? A) It is breaking new ground. B) It treats everyone the same. C) It can beat Google. D) It will provide an income. 32. What is Mark Zuckerberg doing when he talks about Graph Search? A) Encouraging Facebook users to try the new facility B) Advising the public on how to phrase their questions C) Considering which of the two services would be preferable for people D) Comparing the different functions of search engines and Graph Search 33. What phrase does the writer use to illustrate the possibilities Graph Search offers? A) Global trends (line 17) B) Fully assimilated (line 15) C) Cumulative study (line 17) D) Opportunities… endless (line 12) 34. The writer implies that making money through Graph Search A) is an easy way to bring in extra cash. B) does not require someone to be honest. C) causes friction between friends and followers. D) is just another aspect of people living in a digital world. 35. What point is the writer illustrating with the phrase ‘lapping it up’ in line 34? A) The public are contributing to Facebook’s success. B) Technology is turning people into sociopaths. C) People are enjoying it and are keen for more. D) It is fun to interact online. 36. In the final paragraph, the writer suggests that the Internet A) will not retain all its followers. B) has users motivated by greed. C) causes people to become sociopaths. D) is not considered the same by everyone."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine about walking trails in South Africa. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. South Africa’s Garden Route Kylie Briers steps back in time in South Africa’s garden route Knysna is the picturesque tourist focal point of South Africa’s Garden Route region, an area stretching along 150 kilometres of beach towns, mountains and ancient forests on the southern coast of the country. Its clean and tidy streets are awash with travel agents and guesthouses, catering particularly for honeymooners. Life there, however, has not always been so pleasant. When the town was founded in 1882, the local population consisted of gold miners, sailors, colonials, settlers and fortune hunters. 37 ___ However, the woodcutters from Knysna, rural Boers who are the ancestors of today’s Afrikaners, lost out financially on this timber boom. They logged yellowwood and stinkwood from the local woodlands but were manipulated by the timber merchants, and led a hand-to-mouth way of life in remote communities because they were grossly underpaid. Logging ceased in 1939 to preserve the remaining trees and the men who toiled here would have been forgotten had it not been for the writer Dalene Matthee, who wrote four historical novels about their lives. 38 ___ The Garden Route National Park covers 1,200 square kilometres, and roughly thirty-five kilometres west of Knysna, in the Wilderness section, a boardwalk shows the way to the author Matthee’s memorial and the 880-year-old forty metres high yellowwood tree that is named after the writer. 39 ___ It is worthwhile staying there for seven days, to follow the woodcutter’s footsteps on the Outeniqua Hiking Trail. The 108 kilometre trail has accommodation in wooden huts along the route for visitors to stay in at night after a long day hiking through the high-altitude forest covering the Outeniqua Mountains above Knysna, ending in Harkerville Forest. The route passing through Diepwalle Forest, is worth visiting at least for a day if there is no time to follow the whole trail. 40 ___ Hundreds of elephants once wandered through this region, but deforestation and hunting have now decimated the elephant population, leaving only a handful still roaming around. Due to this situation, Knysna Elephant Park, twenty-two kilometres east of the town of Knysna, is a ground-breaking elephant rehabilitation centre. 41 ___ However, if you would prefer to experience what it was like for the woodcutters of the past and sleep outside in the fresh air, visit the extraordinary campsite near Diepwalle Forest Station in the centre of the forest. The Forest Timber Camping Decks include raised platforms among the trees, allowing the camper to gaze around the tops of the trees for the Knysna loeries while they spit and hiss on the barbecue. 42 ___ Imagine lying in your tent where you can hear the forest noises and envisage the old elephants swishing their way through the trees, followed by the sounds of the woodcutters starting their day with a campfire breakfast of coffee and sweet potatoes. It really is a special treat, not to be missed. 43 ___ If walking through the forest is unappealing, then why not try horse riding as a less strenuous way of seeing the delights of the woodland. It’s also possible to fish in the brooks and creeks or try your hand at canoeing down them. Perhaps something more extreme is more to your taste. If so, the National Park offers paragliding, water skiing, scuba diving or abseiling down the mountains. There is something for everyone, whatever their age or temperament.  A This part of the Garden Route National Park is about twenty kilometres inland from Knysna and is very atmospheric, cool and quiet. Actually in Diepwalle, there are three more trails that take you through these mysterious woods. The trails are named after the elephants that once graced the forest. In spite of their size, they could be astonishingly silent on their way through the woodland. They were the woodcutters’ main enemies because they attacked suddenly and with speed. B Whatever time of the year it is, the forest is green all year round. The warm, temperate climate means Knysna is a great destination any time of the year. The balmy winter months on the Garden Route are from May to August, when the weather is sunny and windless. They are sometimes referred to as the ‘secret season’. The trees never lose their leaves and the average daytime temperature is 19°C. C Despite the woodcutters now being but a footnote in history, visitors can experience this absorbing place by going on a series of walking trails through the forest that conjure up the era of the now vanished world of the woodcutters. Windy paths beneath the trees follow the course of rust-coloured burbling streams sparking in the sun. D To move around the park your own transport is needed. There is no public transport. Cars or mountain bikes can be hired, and the Elephant Walks and the Outeniqua Hiking Trail require a permit. These can be obtained at the park. There is a choice of companions that will accompany visitors on guided walks or on other activities in the forests. E Here you can learn about the troubles of the shrinking local elephant populace and go on guided walks with the elephants. There is also an on-site Elephant Lodge with six bedrooms that boasts a lounge looking over the orphaned elephants’ sleeping area. F The port of Knysna could provide safe haven for up to fifty ships, so timber for ship building was in great demand. It was also needed for the railways heading north to the diamond mines, as well for housing and furniture for the European settlers. It was a period of development by the British into what is now South Africa from the Cape Colony, which had expanded from the Cape Town trading post created by the Dutch in 1652. G Tents are pitched on the raised platform, each of which has its own barbecue and a covered space for preparing food, and visitors sleep dangling between the top of the trees and the floor of the forest. The baboons and vervet monkeys are not such welcome visitors, as they always come looking for food. Another reminder of how hard the life of the woodcutters was. H Two other trails, named after another of her books, pass through a wonderland of three metres high tree ferns, very old trees, common and rare fungi and meandering brooks. The longer of the two follows the creek that the gold prospectors would have followed to where they were panning for gold. Another sight to look out for is the extremely rare Knysna loerie bird. Unique to these woods, this big bird is coloured a distinct blue and green with crested head feathers, yet has a flash of red on its wings when in the air."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about colour. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–D). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section does the writer mentio: 44 that a shared experience of colour is always unique? 45 for the first time that people might see colours in different ways? 46 what sort of information is processed when colour is perceived? 47 the idea of colour covering a myriad of shades? 48 the possibility of a medical examination that will resolve nothing? 49 that each individual is unique? 50 people often not being as familiar with others as they think they are? 51 that people see colour differently? DO WE ALL SEE THE SAME COLOURS? Writer Jill Adams reflects on the nature of colour. A One of the most amazing things about colour is the infinite number of hues. When you tell someone you bought a dark blue item of clothing, immediately in their mind springs a vision of that shade of blue. Despite the fact this person has not actually seen the clothing, of course, what they have mentally imagined might well not be the same colour you bought. Does everyone see the same colours? Imagine my husband and me at a football match. ‘Doesn’t the pitch look great? Such a rich green,’ I say, and he agrees. Then I am struck by the thought that he can look at the pitch and say it is green, and he will be of the same mind, but is he really seeing the green the way I am seeing it? Perhaps he had learned to call green what he sees as green, but in actual fact he is seeing nothing like the vibrant green that I see. Or perhaps he is seeing a splendid vivid green and I am the one seeing a pale imitation of it. B My concern about our insight into how we see colours is an aspect of the fundamental fact that basically the human condition is one of isolation. It does not matter how well we think we know someone, we still cannot be totally sure of that familiarity. Psychologists who are behaviourists have always held that if you call any green ‘green’, and you can always tell it apart from yellow, and if we are both aware that the colour of grass is green, then it is irrelevant what the personal perception is. This might well be true, but perhaps there is also some legitimacy in persuading ourselves that the distinctions between our personal perceptions are real and that they do matter, and indeed, perhaps are almost inevitable. We might well use the same adjectives to share experiences, but no one can see the same colour grass, due to perception belonging to the person and not the grass. Because everyone is unique, we definitely see things differently when we talk about looking at something green. C A human’s colour vision begins with the sensors that receive information from the light and turn it into electrical signals which are sent to the brain. These sensors are called photoreceptors and the majority of people have three different kinds of these, which are sensitive to blues, greens and reds in that order, and they use this information to allow us to distinguish the full array of colours. So, although we are sharing moments at a football match, maybe I am seeing something he cannot see, or he is seeing something I cannot see. Even if our perceptions of colour in the brain are different, the data that is entered is likely to be similar. Perhaps I should not worry that even though we both have the same apparatus as regards vision and we can both see the green of the grass, the blue of the seats and sky, and the white shirts and shorts of the players, we each have a personal perception of colour that differs from that of my husband's. D The game finishes and we leave. He might have seen a richer green on the pitch than me, but he will not have the same memories of the other pitches I have seen and the people who were with me. We could both visit the optician for an eye test or have our perception of colour tested, but we would still not know what it is like to be the other person, seeing a particular shade of colour. As long as we can both agree that the pitch is a beautiful colour green, we can be safe in the understanding that I see my green and he sees his. Despite not seeing the exact same colour, we have the shared experience of it, and the act of sharing is also exceptional and unique to the two of us, because no two other people on this planet will have the same recollections."

Young consumers It is impossible these days to avoid the influence of advertising, particularly if you are a child. Advertisers look upon children as the ideal candidates to peddle their wares to. They regard children as an empty vessel that they can fill with their wants and needs. Advertisers and marketing agencies are adroit at targeting children through advertisements, the media – particularly children’s television programmes – and supermarkets, where products for children are all placed at child-eye level. They persuade children that there are certain must-have items they need so as to be accepted as an equal amongst their peers. Children: The impetus for a whole industry Advertising exposes children to what is new and exciting by creating ingenious, humourous, slick and stylish adverts, shown on television to a captive audience. The changing tastes of this generation – from teddy bears, dolls and building blocks to technology – have influenced advertisers around the globe.

Friends Friends burst onto our screens on 22nd September 1994 in the coveted 8:30 Thursday slot on NBC to nearly fifteen million viewers. They spent the next twenty-two minutes in the company of three men and women who were to have an effect on different aspects of culture throughout the world. It was also to be the lowest viewing figures throughout the ten-year run of the sitcom. The writers, Crane and Kauffman, originally conceived the show to be about six people in their twenties, making their way by themselves in Manhattan. They thought about the time when they had finished college and started living alone in a big city. Kauffman is quoted as saying that they were looking at the period when their own future was “more of a question mark.” They believed the idea to be workable, as “everybody knows that feeling,” and it was how they viewed their own lives at the time. They considered Friends just a TV show, albeit an extremely successful one. However, many psychologists realised that the programme was gradually having an impact on culture, not just in America, but around the world. For instance, something as trivial as Jennifer Aniston’s hairstyle, now known as ‘The Rachael,’ after Aniston’s character in the series, is still being sported by many women globally, despite Rachael changing her hairstyle after the end of Season 2 in 1996. Then there was Joey’s catchphrase, “How you doing?”, which became popular in Western English slang, used commonly for greeting friends or as a conversation opener with a stranger. The series also had an influence on the English language in general. The University of Toronto discovered that all the characters stressed the word “so” to modify adjectives, more frequently than any other intensifier. Although it was already reasonably common in American colloquial speech, usage by such popular characters hastened how many more people adopted it in their speech. In addition, Chandler’s practice of leaving a sentence unfinished as a form of sarcasm also influenced how fans of the show spoke in their daily lives. Another great cultural influence has been the Central Perk coffee shop, where much of the action in the series takes place. In 2006, an Iranian businessman registered the name as a franchise in thirty-two countries. The décor of the coffee house in the programme has been replicated in each one, including similar couches, neon signs, bricks and the counter. There are also paintings of the cast adorning the walls and televisions that constantly show episodes of Friends. By far the biggest influence is that which Friends has had on lifestyle – an alternative lifestyle representing young people that have an unorthodox domestic life. The programme epitomises the idea that all that is needed in anyone’s life is good friends. Despite the show presenting stereotypical ideas of class and race, depicting a group of white men and women living in New York City, viewers could identify with the programme through the problems the cast faced each week. It exposed a different way of life and developing relationships that are not usually seen in traditional society. The University of Buffalo classes Friends as “one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.” Their pop-culture experts claim that the impression of young people and the roles they represent are well delineated and symbolise a way of life that centres around creating and maintaining bonds between friends, who are in charge of their own lives and ask for help only from each other. The cast also learned how to be true friends. Before they began filming for the third season, they decided to enter the salary negotiations collectively rather than individually. Although two of the stars had to take a reduction in pay, by the tenth season all six cast members were earning one million dollars an episode – something that was unlikely to have happened if they had not co-operated together. They also reached a deal with Warner Bros to receive syndication royalties, unheard of at the time unless the stars owned part of the show. Again, if they had not collaborated as one entity, they would not have received the royalties. Within the programme, all six actors were equally prominent. The cast members agreed not to let one member dominate, so they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards and during the first season, appeared in magazine photos together. They were also best friends off-screen and have remained so since the series ended. Each considers the rest of the cast their family. Friends is missed by the public and media critics alike, with the latter bemoaning the fate of the sitcom genre now the series has finished. They deem it the final real scripted sitcom, which has been replaced, unfortunately, by more and more reality TV programming. 31. The writer implies in the first paragraph that one reason why the first show was so extraordinary was that A no one realised the social consequences of the programme. B people who watched it knew they were part of a great event. C no one thought it would become so popular with the public. D the writers had based the programme on their own lives. 32. In the third paragraph, the writer’s purpose is to A praise the programme for the effect it had on women’s hair cuts. B present examples of the influence the programme had on people. C explain the English language has changed because of the programme. D highlight the inconsequential effects of the programme on people. 33. According to the writer, one feature of the language used in Friends was A the technique whereby the cast managed to stress certain words. B that it affected the way the American public spoke. C the process by which it taught the public to use irony in speech. D the consistent manner in which it reflected American society. 34. Why does the writer quote the University of Buffalo’s classification of Friends? A To confirm the characters’ way of life was not typically American. B To stress the actors were typecast and not representative of America. C To describe the empathy the public felt with the troubles the cast had. D To underline what an effect the programme had on the viewing public. 35. What point does the example of joining forces illustrate? A How readily people are willing to cooperate. B How easy it is to intimate someone else. C How important it is to work independently. D How much more is achieved by acting as a team. 36. In the last paragraph, what impression are we given about Friends? A It has come to be considered a family programme. B It is not a programme that the critics appreciated. C It was the last of that type of programme. D It changed format to become more real life."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about the work of a fireman. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. The future of fire fighting There have been some imaginative solutions to fighting fires in the world’s tallest buildings, but who better to solve the problem than someone who fights fires for a living? Edd Dale is a fire fighter, who has been putting his life on the line on a daily basis for over twenty years. ‘Remember the film, Towering Inferno? It told the story of the fire in the skyscraper in San Francisco and the epic race to put it out.’ 37 _______ He continues by explaining how sprinkler systems that activate automatically are helpful if there is a small fire, and fire crews and helicopters are brought into play for bigger blazes, especially when they are higher up at a building. The recent fire in the Polat Tower, in Istanbul was tackled in this way, with helicopters working from the top and firemen moving up from the ground. 38 _______ Edd has also been to Moscow, where a fire in the Federation building required hundreds of tons of water to be dropped from the sky to extinguish a fire on the sixty-fifth floor. No one was hurt in Turkey or Moscow, but they were lucky. In America alone, in the space of just four years, an average of nearly sixteen thousand fires in high-rise buildings were reported, with fifty-three deaths and millions of dollars worth of damage. 39 _______ Extra long hoses with high pressure water coursing through them, used with lifting propellers, special types of aeroplanes that are something like helicopters because they would be able to stay stationary, and spray special chemicals on the fire, are just some of the more bizarre ideas that have been put forward in the intervening years. 40 _______ Many cities have tried to take pre-emptive action against the threat of a huge fire in a high-rise building. Sydney, Australia, for example, passed a law in 1912 that a building could only be a maximum height of 150 feet. This enabled the fire fighters of the day to put out fires without any real problems. 41 _______ Some laws really do help the fire services, so I asked Edd what is done now when a fire starts in a high-rise building, and what they would like to see done. According to Edd the first thing is to activate the fire alarm and begin the evacuation of the building’s occupants. Meanwhile, the fire brigade will respond by sending teams of firemen and their engines. 42 _______ Meanwhile, outside the building the fire fighters will be setting up ways for people to exit the building, perhaps using ladders, and they might need to break windows to provide ventilation. They could also be attacking the blaze from the outside. Men are assigned to ensure a continuous water supply, and paramedics would be organised to stand by to treat any victims of the fire and to monitor the firemen. 43 _______ ‘As for the future,’ states Edd, ‘we need laws that can be enforced. Fire retardant paint everywhere and someone on each floor responsible for seeing everyone has been evacuated. The rest is up to firemen like me to find effective ways to quickly extinguish a fire high up in a building.’ A ‘All in all, there’s a lot going on at the same time, and all this is made much more difficult if the fire is hard to reach on a high floor, like the one in Moscow. That building was still under construction, but it was still difficult for the fire brigade to get to and put out.’ B Los Angeles has also been affected by the same fear. A fire code was enacted in 1974 that forces every building to have a flat roof so that helicopters can land on them should there be a fire. ‘LA looks architecturally a bit bland because of this law,’ says Edd, ‘but it’s helped save many lives.’ C Edd travels the world, looking at how other countries deal with this threat. ‘I liaised with the Turkish fire fighters,’ says Edd. ‘We looked at both how the fire broke out, to see if building design could be improved, as well as ways of putting a fire out quickly and effectively. Times have changed now that everyone is building higher into the skies.’ D The fire fighters split into teams. One or more of them will search the building floor by floor, beginning on the floor where the fire has started, looking for trapped people or stragglers. Another team will be actually tackling the fire and there’s always a team on the floor below in case of a mayday. A further team will disable the building’s utilities. Everything is controlled from a central command vehicle at the scene. E ‘As the world’s cities grow taller, we’ve had to tackle the question of how to deal with such situations when we are ill-equipped to handle them,’ Edd laments. Inventors, scientists and other fire fighters have been trying to solve this problem since 1927. ‘So it’s nothing new,’ says Edd, with a rueful smile on his face. F Edd looks at me questioningly. He continues, ‘The Fire Chief in the film had no alternative in the end but to blow up the water tanks on top of the skyscraper, running the risk of killing those still inside the building. In real life we don’t usually have to face such blatant options, but our choices are still as limited.’ G ‘There was even a comic strip, published in 1961, showing a vivid red fire engine hovering in the sky, shooting water at a fire in a skyscraper from a pressure tank on the engine. Very imaginative, but we’re nowhere near anything so marvellous at the moment,’ Edd comments. ‘Ideas like that are still on the drawing board.’ H Edd has spent the last ten years developing a system that could change the way fires are fought forever. It is called Firegrid, a revolutionary approach to fire fighting that could save thousands of lives, giving humans the upper hand over one of their oldest enemies."

In which section does the writer mention: 44 being surprised to see a result in a short period of time? 45 feeling unwell after the first session of activity? 46 an explanation of the health benefits of Tabata? 47 the results of an experiment? 48 searching for something that is elusive? 49 exercise being difficult to incorporate into their daily routine? 50 the success of a person involved in Tabata? 51 how the intensity of exercise makes a difference to fitness? 52 after 4 minutes of Tabata one should feel exhausted? 53 suffering pain despite getting used to the activity? TABATA – THE FOUR-MINUTE MIRACLE WORKOUT Can you really get fit in four minutes every day? Becky Slater finds out. A I’ve always found it difficult to diet and exercise. Finding a healthy way to get fit and lose weight that really works is similar to searching for the Holy Grail. Having unsuccessfully tried Pilates, aerobics and other fad exercise regimes, I came to the conclusion that it was my fault – I have no willpower or motivation. Above all, I lack time and patience to exercise – I’m always looking for the quick way round things. Therefore, the government’s suggestion of five half-hour sessions a week in a gym doing vigorous exercise could be described as my worst nightmare. I’m not on my own. Research has revealed that the main reason people give up on exercise is that they are too busy and cannot fit time in the gym into their schedule, and losing weight cannot be achieved without commitment and effort. So when I heard about Tabata, christened the ‘four-minute miracle’ workout, it seemed too good to be true. How could you transform your body in just four minutes a day? B Tony Sinclair, a former professional footballer turned personal trainer, has been at the forefront of this trend. A few years ago he opened his Tiptop Fitness gyms and hasn’t looked back. Tony explains, ‘Tabata is named after the Japanese scientist, Izumi Tabata, who carried out research to discover which kind of exercise works best. He tested two different groups, with the first pedalling on an exercise bike as fast as they could for four minutes a day. This was made up of eight twenty-second bouts of pedalling, with a ten second break between each bout. The second group was asked to pedal at normal speed for an hour. After completing this five times a week for two months, the Tabata group was much fitter than the second group. The conclusion was that exercising the Tabata way gave better results than an hour in the gym. A Tabata routine can be done with any type of exercise, but the rule of twenty seconds of hard and fast activity followed by ten seconds of rest must be followed.’ C In my first session with Tony, he recommended starting with something easy – twenty seconds of squats and ten seconds of rest for four minutes. I didn’t think it would be too hard, but how wrong can you be? In the first twenty seconds I did ten squats, but that was too few for Tony. I discovered he’s a hard task master, as he shouted at me for not squatting as fast as I should. In the second burst of activity, I managed twelve squats, and by the fifth set of squats, I got to fourteen and my thighs were burning like mad. The ten second ‘rest’ is definitely a misnomer, as it is far too short. After four minutes, I felt sick, dizzy and couldn’t speak or get my breath. Tony was delighted, because that’s how you should feel after a Tabata workout. D I asked Tony why Tabata works. Despite his rather scientific explanation, I worked out that High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), like Tabata, increases your aerobic or lung capacity, as well as your anaerobic capacity – to you and me that’s the length of time you can exercise for at maximum effort. In addition, Tabata exercising builds muscle, and your metabolic rate – the speed at which your body breaks down fat and burns calories – increases in the twenty-four to thirty-six hours after completing the exercises. This leads to faster weight loss. Much to my amazement, by the end of the first week, I’d lost two pounds and by the end of the second, another three, plus two inches off my waistline! I’ve actually started to look forward to my four intense minutes each day. I vary the exercises and split the four minutes up into different exercises to work different areas of my body. For example, one day I might do two minutes of skipping and two minutes of lunges. Or two minutes of press ups and two of squats. It’s still agony, but it’s not too long to endure the pain. I’m getting fitter by the minute and actually want to do more than four minutes a day. A big turnaround for me."

Life in the office To many people, working in an office is an integral part of working life. They enjoy the whole routine of dressing smartly for work, the commute by train or in heavy traffic, greeting their co-workers and the repartee between them as the day progresses and they complete their duties. Lunch breaks spent gossiping with a colleague or a quick trip to the shops, add to the whole ambience of being part of the team. There is always the opportunity to talk to someone about what was on television last night, and even the most irritating workmate has their good moments. The skiver’s charter – working from home When I started working from home rather than going to the office, my biggest concern was whether I’d remain disciplined enough to continue getting up early and work a full eight hours each day. In fact, the problems I’ve faced were not what I expected. For instance, it’s a lonely job and I can go days without talking to anyone – most communication today is by e-mail rather than the phone. In addition, there’s the tricky problem of knowing when to stop work. I always think ‘Oh, I’ll just finish this first’, and before I know it, it’s midnight. Write your essay."
