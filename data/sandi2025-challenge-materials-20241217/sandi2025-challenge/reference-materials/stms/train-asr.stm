SI114J-00026-P10005 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 18.78 <o,Q4,C,P1> i'm extremely (in-) interested in learning about other countries because globalisation (%hesitation%) made me realise that the world is not so big and that countries are closer one to the other than (%hesitation%) we could have imagined (%hesitation%) many years ago

SI114J-00026-P10007 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 9.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is to practice a little bit every day (%hesitation%) let's say at least half an hour per day
SI114J-00026-P10007 1 SI114J-00026 9.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it might be (%hesitation%) writing or speaking or (%hesitation%) writing emails to some colleagues or (%hesitation%) talking with a friend
SI114J-00026-P10008 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 12.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> if i could learn a new skill (%hesitation%) i would love to learn how to play the piano because i'm a big fan of music and i would really love to learn (%hesitation%) to play an instrument

SI114J-00026-P30017 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 12.27 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my personal opinion the affirmation that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying is (%hesitation%) incorrect

SI114J-00026-P30017 1 SI114J-00026 45.29 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so in my opinion it's not something general but it depends on the on the need first of all and then (%hesitation%) it depends on the kind of students that we are talking about
SI114J-00026-P40018 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 12.36 <o,Q4,C,P4> acid rain is produced (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) from the contamination or pollution that factories and vehicles throw into the air

SI114J-00026-P50020 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 9.92 <o,Q3,C,P5> it is vital to drink a lot of water at least two liters of water per day because our body is filled mainly by water

SI114J-00026-P50021 1 SI114J-00026 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion it is absolutely necessary to practise some kind of exercise every day because in the same way we eat every day we sleep every day we need to move our body to make it stronger to give our brain oxygen

SI114J-00037-P10005 1 SI114J-00037 9.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i think (%hesitation%) by learning about different countries i can know different people and (%hesitation%) learn from them
SI114J-00037-P10006 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 6.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) when i'm free i like being with my friends and my families
SI114J-00037-P10006 1 SI114J-00037 6.04 10.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i often (%hesitation%) go swimming with my friends when i'm free
SI114J-00037-P10006 1 SI114J-00037 10.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) when i'm in the water i feel free and i can relax myself and release my pressure by swimming
SI114J-00037-P10007 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 6.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) my teacher suggested that i should (l-) (%hesitation%) improve my english by watching english films
SI114J-00037-P10007 1 SI114J-00037 6.84 9.61 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i think that's a little hard for me
SI114J-00037-P10007 1 SI114J-00037 9.61 16.02 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i like watch (eng-) watching english cartoons to improve my english
SI114J-00037-P10007 1 SI114J-00037 16.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) spongebob squarepants that's my favourite cartoon
SI114J-00037-P10008 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 2.30 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that will be cooking
SI114J-00037-P10008 1 SI114J-00037 2.30 7.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think (%hesitation%) cooking is the (%hesitation%) very important skill in the modern society
SI114J-00037-P10008 1 SI114J-00037 7.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) my girlfriend like eating and (%hesitation%) i i can make me make her happy if i can cook for (hi-) her her
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 9.03 <o,Q5,B2,P3> nowadays more and more people begin to think that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 9.03 27.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) of course (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) doing part time jobs is absolutely (%hesitation%) good because by doing part time jobs you can learn about the society and (%hesitation%) and they can improve their social skills
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 27.52 31.07 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but this thing is not so simple
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 31.07 40.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) not everyone (%hesitation%) can balance the the (re-) relationship between jobs and study
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 40.30 54.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if we force every (w-) student to do part time jobs while they are studying that (%hesitation%) (th-) they may some of them may cannot concentrate on the academic (%hesitation%) purpose
SI114J-00037-P30017 1 SI114J-00037 54.22 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) so that's not very good
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 6.93 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this picture explain how acid rain (%hesitation%) is caused
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 6.93 13.03 <o,Q5,B1,P4> firstly pollution is caused by factories and vehicles
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 13.03 18.36 <o,Q5,B1,P4> as the result acid (part-) particulars are in smoke
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 18.36 21.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then they are carried by wind
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 21.62 34.20 <o,Q5,B1,P4> some of them fall as dust while other acid particles mix with cloud water and (%hesitation%) they are in rain or snow
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 34.20 46.21 <o,Q5,B1,P4> both of the particles fall as dust and (%hesitation%) they are in rain or snows where cause damage to our environment
SI114J-00037-P40018 1 SI114J-00037 46.21 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> i think (%hesitation%) all of us should do something to protect our environment because there is only one earth
SI114J-00037-P50019 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 5.45 <o,Q5,B2,P5> actually i can give them some good (%hesitation%) advice
SI114J-00037-P50019 1 SI114J-00037 5.45 11.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think they can ask for (%hesitation%) experts for help
SI114J-00037-P50019 1 SI114J-00037 11.08 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) i'm sure they can give them useful advice and suggestions
SI114J-00037-P50020 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 10.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we all know that seventy percentage of human body is water
SI114J-00037-P50020 1 SI114J-00037 10.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it very important to drink enough water to keep us health
SI114J-00037-P50021 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 4.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think is very essential to do exercise
SI114J-00037-P50021 1 SI114J-00037 4.16 9.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but on i don't suggest everyone should do exercise every day
SI114J-00037-P50021 1 SI114J-00037 9.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) people should give their body some time to rest and relax
SI114J-00037-P50022 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 8.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) actually i think different people (%hesitation%) need different (%hesitation%) sleeping
SI114J-00037-P50022 1 SI114J-00037 8.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) people at (%hesitation%) different age stage (%hesitation%) will have different (%hesitation%) sleep as well
SI114J-00037-P50023 1 SI114J-00037 0.00 5.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think we should use modern technology wisely
SI114J-00037-P50023 1 SI114J-00037 5.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example we can use artificial intelligence to gave us (%hesitation%) wise advice so that we can better to keep us health healthy
SI114J-00046-P10005 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 5.66 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am a music lover so i am pretty much interested in music
SI114J-00046-P10005 1 SI114J-00046 5.66 10.95 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like to listen classic musics and some m p b music from brazil

SI114J-00046-P10006 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 6.22 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have travelled for more than (%hesitation%) thirty different countries
SI114J-00046-P10006 1 SI114J-00046 6.22 13.07 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like to mingle with other cultures and learn about (%hesitation%) their lifestyle
SI114J-00046-P10006 1 SI114J-00046 13.07 16.32 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i like pretty much (%hesitation%) travelling
SI114J-00046-P10006 1 SI114J-00046 16.32 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> sometimes i live in an airplane not in my house
SI114J-00046-P10007 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 3.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> in fact i have no one in mind
SI114J-00046-P10007 1 SI114J-00046 3.41 7.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> maybe if i could choose one it would be nelson mandela

SI114J-00046-P10007 1 SI114J-00046 16.90 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> that's most important for me
SI114J-00046-P10008 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i believe if i can find a new job and grow into the my career build my career using english would be very nice and (%hesitation%) get some promotions and (%hesitation%) things like that
SI114J-00046-P30017 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 34.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> i believe as our (cul-) culture is becoming even more global it'd be nice to students to learn a foreign language and also as the market the (b-) job market requires and sometimes demands (%hesitation%) its professionals to speak and communicate (w-) with other cultures would be very good if they haves initiatives in their university course at least or at last yeah
SI114J-00046-P30017 1 SI114J-00046 34.30 43.46 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) taking another language learning is appear that (%hesitation%) it consumes a lot of time and efforts
SI114J-00046-P30017 1 SI114J-00046 43.46 55.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it might be recommended to (%hesitation%) issues start studying a language before they enter in their university course
SI114J-00046-P30017 1 SI114J-00046 55.47 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> otherwise it will be very difficult to become
SI114J-00046-P50019 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 17.65 <o,Q5,C,P5> i believe this is reading online news from the internet and also watching (%hesitation%) some american television like c n n and fox news and others
SI114J-00046-P50019 1 SI114J-00046 17.65 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> see what's your best ones
SI114J-00046-P50020 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 2.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> definitely not
SI114J-00046-P50020 1 SI114J-00046 2.23 3.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't agree with that
SI114J-00046-P50020 1 SI114J-00046 3.77 15.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think (new-) newspapers will always exist sometimes in digital or sometimes in physical form but there there will always be newspapers to have one to read
SI114J-00046-P50020 1 SI114J-00046 15.77 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i don't thing newspapers will disappear in the future
SI114J-00046-P50021 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 3.30 <o,Q4,C,P5> i don't think it is
SI114J-00046-P50021 1 SI114J-00046 3.30 7.54 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think social media is everything but reliable
SI114J-00046-P50021 1 SI114J-00046 7.54 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> if you want to get reliable information if you want to get reliable news you have to search for (%hesitation%) other kind of media but social media
SI114J-00046-P50022 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 16.48 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't give lots of importance to local news but i realise some people like to know what's happening in their neighborhood in their city and (%hesitation%) for these people it's quite very important
SI114J-00046-P50022 1 SI114J-00046 16.48 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i like to know better national and international news
SI114J-00046-P50023 1 SI114J-00046 0.00 3.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that is right
SI114J-00046-P50023 1 SI114J-00046 3.75 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> there is a lot of bad news in the media there are a lot of bad news in the media
SI114J-00046-P50023 1 SI114J-00046 10.59 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think this is (%hesitation%) it's the way how we feed off what's most
SI114J-00047-P10005 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 5.17 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i told before i'm living near the border to two other nations
SI114J-00047-P10005 1 SI114J-00047 5.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and therefore we have a lot of people especially from switzerland (%hesitation%) in our in my neighborhood because (%hesitation%) our life because a much (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) more cheaper

SI114J-00047-P10007 1 SI114J-00047 2.26 7.28 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think it would be my brother because he is very similar to me
SI114J-00047-P10007 1 SI114J-00047 7.28 18.32 <o,Q5,B2,P1> he's also a very sportive and he is very ambitional ambitions so he like to get the best results (is-) especially while studying
SI114J-00047-P10007 1 SI114J-00047 18.32 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) definitely would

SI114J-00047-P10008 1 SI114J-00047 12.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really like to (%hesitation%) enjoy working with kids and (%hesitation%) teach them
SI114J-00047-P30017 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 10.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> several reasons which are for and against (%hesitation%) getting a job (%hesitation%) besides (%hesitation%) university studying
SI114J-00047-P30017 1 SI114J-00047 10.98 27.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so one advantage would be that students would have more money for living and even for paying their own bills and more money for their free time
SI114J-00047-P30017 1 SI114J-00047 27.17 39.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> furthermore they are more independent because they didn't haven't to ask their parents for some extra money for their free time
SI114J-00047-P30017 1 SI114J-00047 39.86 53.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> nevertheless one disadvantage is that students would have less free time because of both duties and this includes more duties
SI114J-00047-P30017 1 SI114J-00047 53.98 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in total i agree and am definitely for the
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 8.47 <o,Q5,C,P4> overall there are seven stages from travelling to the airport till flying to the final destination
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 8.47 22.19 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all you have to travel to the airport (%hesitation%) with a (ve-) (ve-) (ve-) (ve-) vehicle and then you are going to the desk (%hesitation%) with the sign of departure
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 22.19 33.66 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the check in desk will help you to (%hesitation%) to check in (%hesitation%) your luggage and even your passports
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 33.66 39.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> at a control station an officer will (ha-) will check your passport
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 39.55 46.51 <o,Q5,C,P4> before you do the security man or woman will check your suitcase
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 46.51 52.50 <o,Q5,C,P4> after this process (%hesitation%) you will wait in the waiting area
SI114J-00047-P40018 1 SI114J-00047 52.50 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can grab some food or even going to shopping in the duty free before the boarding start
SI114J-00047-P50019 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 3.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> ways to use technology
SI114J-00047-P50019 1 SI114J-00047 3.69 14.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example (y-) they could use the technology like the (%hesitation%) internet for searching (%hesitation%) some new informations
SI114J-00047-P50019 1 SI114J-00047 14.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> or even for connecting with others like through
SI114J-00047-P50020 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 11.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it depends but it might be a good solution for people who like to ask their question personally
SI114J-00047-P50020 1 SI114J-00047 11.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) right now because you can also stay in (contac-) (%hesitation%) in contact with your teacher while emailing or
SI114J-00047-P50021 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 10.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the (%hesitation%) most important thing which they could learn is to connect and to work with each other
SI114J-00047-P50021 1 SI114J-00047 10.64 14.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so they have to wait for other answers
SI114J-00047-P50021 1 SI114J-00047 14.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they have to discuss the answers and to (ge-) be
SI114J-00047-P50023 1 SI114J-00047 0.00 2.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> no i'd like this
SI114J-00047-P50023 1 SI114J-00047 2.14 13.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it's a fast running system and therefore we have to use the newest facilities even while learning (%hesitation%) for get better results
SI114J-00047-P50023 1 SI114J-00047 13.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example using more laptops and even
SI114J-00070-P10006 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> to read the news is very important because (%hesitation%) i get information of the world

SI114J-00070-P30017 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 7.55 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i try to explain about practical work experience for students
SI114J-00070-P30017 1 SI114J-00070 7.55 26.68 <o,Q5,B1,P3> at first merit of it it is good experience for students for example industry or business
SI114J-00070-P30017 1 SI114J-00070 26.68 41.25 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and next drawback of it it will be waste of time for other students
SI114J-00070-P30017 1 SI114J-00070 41.25 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i trust in my opinion i don't think everyone needs experience of it because someone of it out of scope
SI114J-00070-P40018 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 8.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> let me explain visitors to three new online pop music site

SI114J-00070-P50019 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think a good read leader is someone who understands and members and draws conclusions
SI114J-00070-P50020 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion in small teams due to the lack of discussion it can lead to wrong conclusions
SI114J-00070-P50021 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 3.17 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes that's right
SI114J-00070-P50021 1 SI114J-00070 3.17 11.14 <o,Q5,B1,P5> members should be encouraged by each other if there is disagreement
SI114J-00070-P50021 1 SI114J-00070 11.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> that will bring us closer to the correct conclusion
SI114J-00070-P50022 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 5.29 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes it does
SI114J-00070-P50022 1 SI114J-00070 5.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> teamwork should be so because they deepen mutual understanding by face to face method
SI114J-00070-P50023 1 SI114J-00070 0.00 4.22 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes i think so too
SI114J-00070-P50023 1 SI114J-00070 4.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> discussing in a team can help us to understand more information than we can think alone
SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 1.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot

SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077 11.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think it's very important for them to be recognised in the society (%hesitation%) because there there are so many tracks and artists
SI114J-00077-P10006 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 5.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot because i for me it's very important to discover new places
SI114J-00077-P10006 1 SI114J-00077 5.60 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) but the main reason is that i can feel relaxed so i don't i can be a lot of distracted and i can learn also about new cultures (%hesitation%) from the people that lives there how they way of life
SI114J-00077-P10007 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 5.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say rafael nadal who is a tennis player and a spanish player

SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 9.28 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my case my i'm finishing my degree it's (%hesitation%) about how to be i mean how to administrate a business
SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077 9.28 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i would say that a lot because in the future probably i would need it for talking to people from wales or in england for making some business
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 6.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion the best way is going to the internet and searching for the news that they are interest in
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077 6.75 18.55 <o,Q3,C,P5> (%hesitation%) should take a look for media like for example b b c or c n n so they have like a regular perspective of what is happening around the world
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077 18.55 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> and have a far
SI114J-00077-P50020 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 16.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> i have to disagree with this assumption because for example in emergence countries like brazil or indonesia they will need (%hesitation%) newspaper also because they don't have access to the internet connection in all the areas

SI114J-00077-P50021 1 SI114J-00077 6.09 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> because for example there are a lot of fake news (%hesitation%) going around twitter or facebook so we have to need to take care about it and take everything with a grain of salt
SI114J-00077-P50022 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 12.64 <o,Q3,C,P5> local news are essential for bringing the community together because thanks to it we know what's happening in our local town or in our village for example

SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077 0.00 14.17 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) i think that that's true that is true because there are a lot of bad news (%hesitation%) around the world and also with the coronated pandemic (%hesitation%) we see like more of it
SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077 14.17 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> so i think that the important thing of the news is to inform
SI114J-00084-P10005 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that it could be very interesting because (%hesitation%) it's a good way to understand other cultures and also it's a good reason (%hesitation%) to go to visit another cities and another (%hesitation%) countries
SI114J-00084-P10006 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 8.47 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like to go out with my friends and also stay with my girlfriend and or or my family

SI114J-00084-P10007 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that (%hesitation%) the thing that help me more was (%hesitation%) (s-) (%hesitation%) watching tv series in english and also reading books (%hesitation%) and watching some films without subtitles trying to understand everything
SI114J-00084-P10008 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 7.44 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to learn (%hesitation%) playing (%hesitation%) some instruments like guitar or piano

SI114J-00084-P30017 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 22.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some advantages of (%hesitation%) doing a part time job is for example that you win a lot of experience in your (%hesitation%) knowledge area and also you have the opportunity to save some money and pay the bills of the degree
SI114J-00084-P30017 1 SI114J-00084 22.98 38.88 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand (%hesitation%) you have less time to study during the exam period and also you have less time to prepare some works or or homework
SI114J-00084-P30017 1 SI114J-00084 38.88 48.70 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) so i would recommend it but it it have (%hesitation%) to be (%hesitation%) up to everyone
SI114J-00084-P30017 1 SI114J-00084 48.70 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and also i would recommend that (%hesitation%) this part time job should be in their knowledge area
SI114J-00084-P40018 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 10.64 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the pollution of the vehicles and factories produce (%hesitation%) an smoke that is compose by acid particles
SI114J-00084-P40018 1 SI114J-00084 10.64 19.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and part of these (%hesitation%) acid particles (%hesitation%) are thrown to the to the ground in form of dust
SI114J-00084-P40018 1 SI114J-00084 19.73 24.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and also another part are mixed with the clouds
SI114J-00084-P40018 1 SI114J-00084 24.23 46.14 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these clouds (%hesitation%) that are compose by (%hesitation%) acid particles and also (%hesitation%) water (%hesitation%) produce some acid rain and also (%hesitation%) another type of precipitations that that is (%hesitation%) the snow for example
SI114J-00084-P40018 1 SI114J-00084 46.14 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) these two types of precipitations provoke a damage (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) environment
SI114J-00084-P50019 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the most important part it's to have a regular meals with your own hours (%hesitation%) to eat and also (%hesitation%) have a control in what you are eating (%hesitation%) during the day
SI114J-00084-P50020 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 13.15 <o,Q5,B1,P5> drinking water (%hesitation%) it's totally necessary (%hesitation%) to hydratate our body and also to give us the sensation that we are full
SI114J-00084-P50020 1 SI114J-00084 13.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and also will (%hesitation%) do that we are not going to be (%hesitation%) so (hung-)
SI114J-00084-P50021 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it's not necessary to do exercise every day
SI114J-00084-P50021 1 SI114J-00084 4.34 9.64 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but it's necessary do (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) do some exercise (%hesitation%) regularly
SI114J-00084-P50021 1 SI114J-00084 9.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) it have to be enough to stay (%hesitation%) health and prevent some (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00084-P50022 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 7.21 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that everyone needs (%hesitation%) a (nu-) (%hesitation%) a number of hours (%hesitation%) a different number of of hours
SI114J-00084-P50022 1 SI114J-00084 7.21 13.54 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example i need only seven and in the (m-) mornings i am very fresh
SI114J-00084-P50022 1 SI114J-00084 13.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so everyone have to sleep what they need
SI114J-00084-P50023 1 SI114J-00084 0.00 8.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that in one hand it will give you a lot of of information about (%hesitation%) everything you want
SI114J-00084-P50023 1 SI114J-00084 8.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but on in on the other hand it will (%hesitation%) entertain you and will make that you don't dedicate a lot of time doing exercise or sleeping
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 14.18 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's a very quiet and residential neighbour but like five hundred meters away from here we have a very beautiful forest with a lot animals
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 14.18 15.58 <o,Q4,C,P1> we have a river
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 15.58 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so during the weekends i used to go there
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 1.76 <o,Q4,C,P1> it depends
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088 1.76 6.48 <o,Q4,C,P1> for example during summer holidays i love to travel
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088 6.48 11.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> i usually go to warm places with my friends
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088 11.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but during winter holidays i love to stay in with my family or with my friends and play for example
SI114J-00088-P10007 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> it probably is my younger sister because she is the person of my family who has more or less the more similar age to me so we have similarities of music similar hobbies so we spend a lot of time together
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 3.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> right now it is not very clear for me
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088 3.85 9.07 <o,Q4,C,P1> i know i would love to do something related with business
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088 9.07 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but the thing that i have the most clear is that i wanna have a job that requires to travel a lot and to be in a lot of cities
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 21.57 <o,Q4,C,P3> so on the one hand we have the advantages of getting a job for paying the universitary (degr-) studies is that you free your parents' responsibilities of paying also you get more experience even though it is something that is not related to your degree
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 21.57 26.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you have you may have additional income for the weekends or for holidays
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 26.99 36.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand you can (n-) you can not live properly the universitary lifestyle
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 36.00 47.60 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also you may be a little bit more stressed because of the (subje-) subjects of the university because you don't have as many time as other peers
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 47.60 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion it is very useful and very important to have a job but maybe a part time job and not a full time
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 5.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> ok so today's presentation is about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 5.34 13.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> as you all know the airplane is one of the few means of communication that we have right now
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 13.14 16.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> so first of all we'll have to go to the airports
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 16.16 19.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> that is a place where the flights leave
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 19.34 24.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> so once we get in there we will have to check in
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 24.22 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> that means giving some people that works for the company we are flying with our information so they will give us our tickets
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 32.97 35.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> and we can give them our luggage
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 35.57 41.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> then we'll go through the document control and after that the security
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 41.38 49.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> they will check that everything that we have in our luggage and that we are able to go to the other place because we have the visas
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 49.97 53.11 <o,Q4,C,P4> we'll have to wait a little bit until we board
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 53.11 56.96 <o,Q4,C,P4> the boarding time is thirty minutes before the flight
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 56.96 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then leave
SI114J-00088-P50019 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so for example the technology (%hesitation%) could be very useful when doing our research for example because instead of having to use an encylopedia they can use other websites that you can find that tell more into detail about those themes
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> i really think so because if you are face to face with your teacher you have to pay attention to him and you will be more able to understand what he's saying and to ask questions in real life
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088 15.25 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> because if some questions arise while you are studying at home you cannot
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 10.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's very important working in groups because in the future you'll need to work in groups with other workmates
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 10.64 15.74 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i don't know like a lot of skills are developed while working in groups
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 15.74 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think like the most important ones are the soft skills
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 5.79 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course and it is the same reasoning as the face to face
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088 5.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> because if you have any questions while you are there you can obviously ask in the moment or i dunno after class
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088 15.25 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> you cannot go ask to the teacher if you need like some (offic-)
SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088 0.00 5.35 <o,Q4,C,P5> even though i think it's important i don't think it's the most important thing
SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088 5.35 13.45 <o,Q4,C,P5> i mean you obviously gotta have like a library (%hesitation%) some computers in order to let people do research

SI114J-00091-P10007 1 SI114J-00091 8.60 13.37 <o,Q5,C,P1> i've been living there for one (o-) one year
SI114J-00091-P10007 1 SI114J-00091 13.37 18.34 <o,Q5,C,P1> and since i was nineteen years old i have never come back there
SI114J-00091-P10007 1 SI114J-00091 18.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) so i really miss that
SI114J-00091-P10008 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,C,P1> maybe try to speak (%hesitation%) prefectly english you know a super english and being a a master of languages
SI114J-00091-P10008 1 SI114J-00091 10.04 14.24 <o,Q4,C,P1> yes that's what i that would be a must for me
SI114J-00091-P10008 1 SI114J-00091 14.24 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i would do whatever it takes to improve my english my speaking english
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 9.27 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantages about (%hesitation%) having part time jobs while you are a student at the college are so many
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 9.27 12.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you can pay your rent or you can pay your books
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 12.75 34.64 <o,Q5,C,P3> and what disadvantages we have on the other side are mainly that you rest time for studying and in doing so you're gonna find yourself in a in a little bit trouble or in a little bit hurry to prepare your test and pass them in a proper way
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 34.64 45.97 <o,Q5,C,P3> my personal point of view about this situation is that (%hesitation%) whenever you are studying at p h at the university you should spend a hundred percent doing
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 45.97 51.43 <o,Q5,C,P3> so so if you're a student be a student for the whole time
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 51.43 55.42 <o,Q5,C,P3> don't mess with other things like working or having part time jobs
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 55.42 58.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> that's (%hesitation%) not the the best option for me to take
SI114J-00091-P30017 1 SI114J-00091 58.39 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> i wouldn't do so
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 6.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> well let's see how this thing works about (%hesitation%) the acid rain
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 6.12 15.17 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) it comes from the pollution that it is originally form in factories all around the world
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 15.17 16.82 <o,Q5,C,P4> what happens this
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 16.82 27.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> so when the factories are working (%hesitation%) they create a smoke and this smoke contains these acid particles that are so damages for the environment
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 27.08 31.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this goes through the air carried by with the wind
SI114J-00091-P40018 1 SI114J-00091 31.58 42.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then we having them back and falling down as dust you know so they can (%hesitation%) damage all the environment all the lakes all the rivers

SI114J-00091-P50019 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 6.67 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all these people should buy only healthy food

SI114J-00091-P50019 1 SI114J-00091 12.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and second one you should check and consult a doctor to see what his advise about this is about
SI114J-00091-P50020 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 6.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> didn't it is not so important to drink tons of water
SI114J-00091-P50020 1 SI114J-00091 6.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> what is really important that you should do must do every day is to drink at least two liters of water because we are (%hesitation%) eighty percent water in our body so we need water
SI114J-00091-P50021 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 3.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well this is a tricky question but i don't think so
SI114J-00091-P50021 1 SI114J-00091 3.17 6.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think it it is essential question of life
SI114J-00091-P50021 1 SI114J-00091 6.50 15.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is good for you if you take (%hesitation%) the habit of doing i don't know maybe twice a week that would be enough
SI114J-00091-P50021 1 SI114J-00091 15.91 19.26 <o,Q5,B2,P5> or playing tennis or football or whatever you prefer
SI114J-00091-P50021 1 SI114J-00091 19.26 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that's enough
SI114J-00091-P50022 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 7.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think i i need more than eight hours per per night
SI114J-00091-P50022 1 SI114J-00091 7.44 12.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but my daughter she's eight years old and she needs ten
SI114J-00091-P50022 1 SI114J-00091 12.09 13.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so where's the middle point
SI114J-00091-P50022 1 SI114J-00091 13.88 15.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't really know
SI114J-00091-P50022 1 SI114J-00091 15.28 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we should take (%hesitation%) the time that
SI114J-00091-P50023 1 SI114J-00091 0.00 9.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think it's has for sure an unhealthy (%hesitation%) effect on people's life
SI114J-00091-P50023 1 SI114J-00091 9.56 13.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also in in people's health
SI114J-00091-P50023 1 SI114J-00091 13.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because you know nowadays we live in a pandemic situation or environment and everybody is
SI114J-00104-P10005 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 5.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm for interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00104-P10005 1 SI114J-00104 5.58 11.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and learning about other countries i can learn people from different areas and cultures
SI114J-00104-P10005 1 SI114J-00104 11.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i believe that inspiration come from the creation of different cultures and ideas
SI114J-00104-P10006 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 5.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i'm free i like to go swimming with my friends or my families
SI114J-00104-P10006 1 SI114J-00104 5.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i'm in the water i feel totally free and i can relax myself and release my pressure by swimming
SI114J-00104-P10007 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 8.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) many people around me may think the best way to improve english (%hesitation%) is watching english films
SI114J-00104-P10007 1 SI114J-00104 8.70 13.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think (%hesitation%) watching english films is too hard for me
SI114J-00104-P10007 1 SI114J-00104 13.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i'm trying to watch english cartoon like spongebob squarepants
SI114J-00104-P10008 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 2.96 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think that'd be driving

SI114J-00104-P10008 1 SI114J-00104 7.92 13.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) if i can drive by myself i can go anywhere i want to go
SI114J-00104-P10008 1 SI114J-00104 13.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) i don't need my parents' help
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 7.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> many people say that all new university students should do part time jobs while they're studying
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 7.61 22.74 <o,Q5,B2,P3> they think they can learn more about (%hesitation%) the society and (%hesitation%) be prepared for (%hesitation%) landing a job by doing part time jobs while they're studying
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 22.74 28.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> buts the problem is not so simple
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 28.05 37.08 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i (actua-) (%hesitation%) of course (%hesitation%) there are many advantages of doing part time jobs
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 37.08 51.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) if (%hesitation%) college students put too much time on doing part time jobs he or she may don't have time to do to do with (%hesitation%) their studies
SI114J-00104-P30017 1 SI114J-00104 51.28 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think (%hesitation%) this depends
SI114J-00104-P40018 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 6.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> let me introduces something about the acid rain
SI114J-00104-P40018 1 SI114J-00104 6.29 41.13 <o,Q4,B2,P4> factories and vehicles makes pollution and (%hesitation%) so acid particles are in the (s-) smoke and then as the particles are carried by winds and (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) (s-) some acid particles fall as dust while other acid particles mix with cloud water and (%hesitation%) but they (%hesitation%) fall by rain and (%hesitation%) yeah in rain or snow
SI114J-00104-P40018 1 SI114J-00104 41.13 45.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they cause damage to the environment
SI114J-00104-P40018 1 SI114J-00104 45.45 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i think we should reduce the pollution caused by factories and vehicles to reduce acid rain to protect our environment
SI114J-00104-P50019 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) (ge-) they can ask for experts for help because they can give you good advice so that you can keep good eating habits
SI114J-00104-P50020 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 13.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the most important thing to keep health is drinking water because water is the most important part of our body
SI114J-00104-P50020 1 SI114J-00104 13.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) play a important role in our health
SI114J-00104-P50021 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 6.22 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the importance of doing exercise is self evidence
SI114J-00104-P50021 1 SI114J-00104 6.22 12.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> doing exercise can keep us energy and (%hesitation%) healthier
SI114J-00104-P50021 1 SI114J-00104 12.55 16.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i don't think (%hesitation%) we should doing exercise every day
SI114J-00104-P50021 1 SI114J-00104 16.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we should (%hesitation%) have time to rest
SI114J-00104-P50022 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 12.27 <o,Q4,B2,P5> somebody may need (%hesitation%) more than eight hours sleeping while others may need less hours of sleeping
SI114J-00104-P50022 1 SI114J-00104 12.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think (%hesitation%) different people (%hesitation%) (ca-) will have a different way to sleep
SI114J-00104-P50023 1 SI114J-00104 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) if people use modern technology wisely and properly there will be a very good thing to make our self healthier
SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 9.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) to know about other countries for me is something always very exciting and very nice
SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123 9.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i am very excited to to know about other countries
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 9.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i can't i like to go away to the countryside with some friends some family and take funny times
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123 9.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if it's possible make some barbecues with them and just have fun
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 6.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my english i think the best way it's to learn and to practice and practice and practice again
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123 6.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) so to improve my personal english i will hear more more documentals or tv programmes or (%hesitation%) read more books in english
SI114J-00123-P10008 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to to learn to fly drones because it's something that maybe it could help me in my work to make some photos (%hesitation%) in the air of some buildings or some spaces
SI114J-00123-P30017 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 7.33 <o,Q5,C,P3> okay so nowadays (%hesitation%) some students have part time jobs during their studies
SI114J-00123-P30017 1 SI114J-00123 7.33 32.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think that well it's a good idea because it can give give you some knowledge about how it's the work outside of the of the highly skill but the same time you have to deal or manage your time more carefully because you have to (t-) have time for study and have time for work
SI114J-00123-P30017 1 SI114J-00123 32.16 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion if it's possible to everyone i will say that they take a part time job because it will (gi-) it will give you them (%hesitation%) a lot of opportunity a lot of skills and a lot of new knowledge about other things so it's a great thing
SI114J-00123-P40018 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 40.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so as we can see (%hesitation%) in the pollution of of the factories or the vehicles (%hesitation%) there are some acid particles that (%hesitation%) goes away of the smoke and mixed with some weather clouds zones or just fall fall downs of of that smoke and that makes that mixed with with this (%hesitation%) weather conditions (%hesitation%) we can find it and and with with some rain or some snow then goes down and damage the environment of of where where are falling down
SI114J-00123-P40018 1 SI114J-00123 40.75 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so in conclusion we have to control more this pollution and this the kind of acid that we can find in in the pollution to don't have this damage in the environment
SI114J-00123-P50019 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> okay so i will suggest (%hesitation%) them to to control the meals because (%hesitation%) have a good timing with that it's something important and to have that regularly in your in your days is something important to eating habits
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 16.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) drinking water is always important not just to have a healthy lifestyle or to be healthy because you have to drink two two liters of of water per day if you can
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123 16.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's the recommendation
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 11.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course it's something essential (%hesitation%) to be to to feel good with your yourself and to be healthy you have to do exercise (%hesitation%) the time that you need
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123 11.59 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> not you don't have to to take every day five hours but (%hesitation%) such (%hesitation%) a little time yes
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 3.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that it's not essential to sleep eight hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123 3.79 11.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can be productive and you can be healthy just sleeping seven six hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123 11.06 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> you have to find the kind of hours you (ha-) you need for your body
SI114J-00123-P50023 1 SI114J-00123 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) both because you can you can use the technology to be more healthy with some activities or application advices or in other case you can use it for bad (%hesitation%) healthy (%hesitation%) routines
SI114J-00127-P10005 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 12.06 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am really interested in learning about other language and learn about other cultures learn how and why people behave that way
SI114J-00127-P10005 1 SI114J-00127 12.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and it's really interesting to know (%hesitation%) other people in other countries
SI114J-00127-P10006 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 2.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am really keen on tennis
SI114J-00127-P10006 1 SI114J-00127 2.93 7.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love playing tennis at weekends and when i have free time
SI114J-00127-P10006 1 SI114J-00127 7.35 15.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> also i love watching movies reading books i also do yoga
SI114J-00127-P10006 1 SI114J-00127 15.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it's it's really a bit of everything
SI114J-00127-P10007 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 6.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) well the best way would be speaking it with english people
SI114J-00127-P10007 1 SI114J-00127 6.27 14.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> also reading books that helps you a lot with the vocabulary also watching movies in english
SI114J-00127-P10007 1 SI114J-00127 14.15 18.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that would be all the things you can do to improve your english
SI114J-00127-P10007 1 SI114J-00127 18.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there are so many
SI114J-00127-P10008 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 15.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think it would be learning german because as i told i work in a company i'm the purchasing department i deal every day with suppliers that are ninety percent from germany
SI114J-00127-P10008 1 SI114J-00127 15.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it would be very useful to know learn german
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 12.47 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think the advantages would be they learn about (%hesitation%) responsibility and they learn experience from their jobs
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 12.47 18.64 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there is a great i think there is disadvantages also
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 18.64 36.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> there are they have to they have less time to study less time to to go to university and to do the the things and maybe it can delay on their doing their career
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 36.28 44.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion it's important but doing it at the last years of the career not at the beginning
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 44.92 58.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> because if they start (%hesitation%) very soon working (%hesitation%) their career they get delay and maybe they could (%hesitation%) quit they g c their university career
SI114J-00127-P30017 1 SI114J-00127 58.52 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so that's my
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 5.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well let's speak about how acid rain is produced
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 5.46 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> all starts in the factories and the vehicles they produce (%hesitation%) smokes
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 12.77 27.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) this smoke comes in the air and some particle falls as dust others go up (%hesitation%) and mix with cloud water
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 27.88 41.60 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this mix also when it rains it this (%hesitation%) water contains the acid particles and also it can fall as snow or rain
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 41.60 49.55 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it falls to the vegetation to trees and other plants and damages
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 49.55 54.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we must (%hesitation%) stop pollution from factories
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 54.91 59.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they must take care of the air they expel
SI114J-00127-P40018 1 SI114J-00127 59.03 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they
SI114J-00127-P50019 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 6.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well the first advice i would give them is to only buy healthy food
SI114J-00127-P50019 1 SI114J-00127 6.13 12.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you don't have junk food in your fridge in your house you won't be able to eat them
SI114J-00127-P50019 1 SI114J-00127 12.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that's (%hesitation%) the the main advice i could give people want to eat (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00127-P50020 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 12.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it's important because (%hesitation%) we must drink at least three liters of water a day to clean our organism and make our kidneys to work
SI114J-00127-P50020 1 SI114J-00127 12.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it's good also for the skins and other things also
SI114J-00127-P50021 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well yes this is proved that making exercise it helps our our cardiovascular system and also (h-) produce our body produces the endorphins that makes us feel good
SI114J-00127-P50022 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 5.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's important to to sleeps eight that eight hour
SI114J-00127-P50022 1 SI114J-00127 5.04 12.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> our body really needs to recover itself and that it's when we sleep
SI114J-00127-P50022 1 SI114J-00127 12.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we need to recover our brain our muscles and we need for that we need eight hours at sleep
SI114J-00127-P50023 1 SI114J-00127 0.00 5.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the negative thing about this is it's become like addictive
SI114J-00127-P50023 1 SI114J-00127 5.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but there are (%hesitation%) technologies like a smartwatch that help us to monitoring our activities and it's positive to our health
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 3.97 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i'm really interested in the environment
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132 3.97 7.21 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that we must respect it
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132 7.21 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> because if we want to continue living here we don't (ha-) we we aren't going to have another world to make
SI114J-00132-P10006 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 16.48 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i enjoy going to the cinema with them or going to a restaurant to have dinner have lunch and also doing different sport like swimming running or cycling

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 11.50 <o,Q3,B2,P3> doing fitness classes is really important to everybody because it has a lot of advantages
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 11.50 33.67 <o,Q3,B2,P3> some of them are that (%hesitation%) you are going to have a healthy life and you're going to learn to organise your time during the day because you you don't have only to study you also (%hesitation%) need to have time to do another things
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 33.67 38.76 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so fitness class classes can be (%hesitation%) like a hobby

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 56.55 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion it is necessary
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 8.93 <o,Q3,B2,P4> the honey is a really natural food that you can eat during your breakfast for for example
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 8.93 12.61 <o,Q3,B2,P4> and it is going to be really healthful
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 12.61 22.84 <o,Q3,B2,P4> but the honey before arrive to the supermarket and to your home it pass for a different steps
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 22.84 27.96 <o,Q3,B2,P4> first of all bees collect nectar (%hesitation%) from the flowers

SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 34.02 43.77 <o,Q3,B2,P4> the beekeepers are going to collect this honey (%hesitation%) which are in the the hives
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132 43.77 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P4> and the honey is going to be transport to the different supermarket and you where you are going to be able to buy it and to transport it to your home to consume it
SI114J-00132-P50019 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 6.79 <o,Q3,B2,P5> when you choose a country to study you think about different things
SI114J-00132-P50019 1 SI114J-00132 6.79 18.13 <o,Q3,B2,P5> for example (%hesitation%) you think (i-) (%hesitation%) the country is really expensive or not because you are going to afford everything
SI114J-00132-P50019 1 SI114J-00132 18.13 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i'm told many people

SI114J-00132-P50021 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 16.78 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) difficulties that you can have it is going to be in the first phase (wh-) when you adapt to the country if you are not going to have a lot of difficulties
SI114J-00132-P50021 1 SI114J-00132 16.78 20.11 <o,Q3,B2,P5> like you are going to miss your family but
SI114J-00132-P50022 1 SI114J-00132 0.00 7.10 <o,Q3,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to know about local culture is (%hesitation%) making friends
SI114J-00132-P50022 1 SI114J-00132 7.10 20.11 <o,Q3,B2,P5> because (%hesitation%) your friends who lived there are going to be able to explained about the culture better than

SI114J-00132-P50023 1 SI114J-00132 2.23 13.41 <o,Q3,B2,P5> you learn to to become independent because you are not living with your family so you you need to do everything
SI114J-00132-P50023 1 SI114J-00132 13.41 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> you learn to organise your time during the day because you are going to do a lot of things
SI114J-00134-P10005 1 SI114J-00134 0.00 13.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i love to learn about the other countries mainly the countries in the europe because i love the culture and i love the food and everything that it's from italy for example
SI114J-00134-P10005 1 SI114J-00134 13.34 17.69 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i love to understand the language the different ones

SI114J-00134-P10006 1 SI114J-00134 0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so first of all i like to do gym and i like to go to do to practise some yoga and i go for a run every day at least one hour
SI114J-00134-P10006 1 SI114J-00134 11.36 14.01 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i love to do that
SI114J-00134-P10006 1 SI114J-00134 14.01 19.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) also i love to go to cinema and theatre enjoy a lot of food

SI114J-00134-P10007 1 SI114J-00134 0.00 10.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think to improve your english you must listen and probably do a course near to your home or even online
SI114J-00134-P10007 1 SI114J-00134 10.04 12.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think you have to practice
SI114J-00134-P10007 1 SI114J-00134 12.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there's with your neighbourhoods or even with a friend speaking with them and listening

SI114J-00134-P10008 1 SI114J-00134 17.60 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i could do it would be (perf-)
SI114J-00134-P30017 1 SI114J-00134 0.00 15.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think the advantage for do a part time whle you are studying in university is to know about the job that you probably will do when you are working on future for example
SI114J-00134-P30017 1 SI114J-00134 15.34 34.10 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) however there's a disadvantage for that could be if you don't if you are obligated to do something must be bad for you when you don't like to do something like that
SI114J-00134-P30017 1 SI114J-00134 34.10 51.15 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but i think in my opinion it could be more advantage than disadvantage in this case because (%hesitation%) i think it's more useful when you are learning about that skill that you are practising in the future
SI114J-00134-P30017 1 SI114J-00134 51.15 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and also you can know before to finish your degree if you like or not to do this type of
SI114J-00134-P40018 1 SI114J-00134 0.00 11.63 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so the pollution can be spread and cause acid rain through the factories and (veh-) vehicles mainly
SI114J-00134-P40018 1 SI114J-00134 11.63 13.64 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) it cause the pollution
SI114J-00134-P40018 1 SI114J-00134 13.64 22.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and it becomes (%hesitation%) acid particles and the smoke from the smoke so it becomes after that

SI114J-00134-P40018 1 SI114J-00134 29.78 37.45 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the acid particles are carried by them and some acid particles fail as a dust

SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 6.75 <o,Q4,B1,P4> ok (%hesitation%) welcome to our speech about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 6.75 12.79 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you want to travel by airplane the first thing that you need is to travel to the airport
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 12.79 20.31 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you can do it by car or bus or by train because in our city we have all these facilities
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 20.31 36.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> once you have arrived to the airport (%hesitation%) you must go to the to check in for the check in to the boarding counter where you can leave your luggage your big luggage
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 36.06 41.82 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that you must go to the document control and show your passport
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 41.82 49.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> later (%hesitation%) you pass through the security security board
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 49.10 54.67 <o,Q4,B1,P4> there they check that you have the that (y-) you don't have any dangerous object
SI114J-00137-P40018 1 SI114J-00137 54.67 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you wait in the (%hesitation%) in the big room for example
SI114J-00137-P50019 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 10.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> okay technology is a revolution in education on education so the way that the student can use it is very easy
SI114J-00137-P50019 1 SI114J-00137 10.77 13.47 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can take their doubts
SI114J-00137-P50019 1 SI114J-00137 13.47 17.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can have access to all information
SI114J-00137-P50019 1 SI114J-00137 17.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they can't add it (er-)
SI114J-00137-P50020 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 8.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the ways the best way for learning is depend on your personal characteristics
SI114J-00137-P50020 1 SI114J-00137 8.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> obviously (%hesitation%) when you are learning face to face you can (%hesitation%) interact with the students and the teacher with the with the student too
SI114J-00137-P50021 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 5.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the most importants abilities are the cooperative abilities
SI114J-00137-P50021 1 SI114J-00137 5.43 16.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they learn to communicate each other and to listen to (%hesitation%) to listen to and respect the opinion and ideas of others
SI114J-00137-P50021 1 SI114J-00137 16.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they can increase (%hesitation%) theirselves
SI114J-00137-P50022 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 4.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm not sure if it is very effective
SI114J-00137-P50022 1 SI114J-00137 4.18 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> probably simply is a different way of reading (%hesitation%) depend of the goal of these reading
SI114J-00137-P50022 1 SI114J-00137 12.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if it's a reading for pleasure or if it's an academic reading (%hesitation%) you choose one or the other
SI114J-00137-P50023 1 SI114J-00137 0.00 9.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think is very important because every people (%hesitation%) have to have access to the university
SI114J-00137-P50023 1 SI114J-00137 9.27 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> is not important your personal situation in this moment because whenever you want you can't (%hesitation%) go to university and learn and improve your life
SI114J-00138-P10005 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 10.61 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am fond of a foreign countries foreign cultures so i am really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00138-P10005 1 SI114J-00138 10.61 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i travel a lot and i try to travel as as much as i can
SI114J-00138-P10006 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 3.61 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i have a soft spot for horses
SI114J-00138-P10006 1 SI114J-00138 3.61 8.45 <o,Q5,C,P1> i actually own two horses and i spend all my free time with my horses
SI114J-00138-P10006 1 SI114J-00138 8.45 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love to ride and (%hesitation%) i ride as as often as i can
SI114J-00138-P10007 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 15.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> in my opinion (%hesitation%) to improve a language and mostly english the most useful way would be to speak a lot because when you speak you use grammar vocabulary and also fluency
SI114J-00138-P10007 1 SI114J-00138 15.03 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i think it's the best way to improve a language
SI114J-00138-P10008 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 12.58 <o,Q5,C,P1> honestly i would be glad to learn a new language or for instance to brush up on spanish because i used to speak spanish quite well
SI114J-00138-P10008 1 SI114J-00138 12.58 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 11.57 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i i know that (%hesitation%) some students have a part time job because they need some money
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 11.57 18.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i of course the obvious advantages the first one actually is to have money
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 18.43 29.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some students needs money for their life in order to buy food to have leisures or (%hesitation%) or even just to pay for their (%hesitation%) university fees
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 29.71 35.11 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but of course there are some strong disadvantages related to all that
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 35.11 46.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) obviously they have less time to study because they need to be at their work part time which means that half of the time they are not at university
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 46.72 47.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> they have to work
SI114J-00138-P30017 1 SI114J-00138 47.77 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that (%hesitation%) it's a problem because (%hesitation%) they (sh-) they are likely to need more time to study and to focus on their study which is the real goal of
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 5.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all we could wonder what a acid rain is
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 5.23 13.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the acid rain actually comes from the pollution which (%hesitation%) (b-) itself comes from plants
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 13.81 21.19 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the plants send pollution in the air through smoke and the smoke are carried by the wind
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 21.19 25.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some of the acid particles fall as dust on the ground
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 25.12 30.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) another part just follow the wind and mix with the cloud
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 30.22 41.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then when it rains the rain or the snow carry acid particles and so acid particles comes to go to the ground and pollute everything
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 41.95 52.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> that's why acid rains create pollution because it just goes back directly to the trees to the vegetation to nature
SI114J-00138-P40018 1 SI114J-00138 52.70 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and so that's the (%hesitation%) simple relation between plants and pollution which go
SI114J-00138-P50019 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 17.39 <o,Q4,C,P5> well first of all i would advise these people to (%hesitation%) eat more organic food and also to heat to eat less meat because (%hesitation%) in the meat we eat too much meat nowadays and it's not healthy at all
SI114J-00138-P50019 1 SI114J-00138 17.39 20.11 <o,Q4,C,P5> so please just go to (organi-)
SI114J-00138-P50020 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 17.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> drinking lots of water is essential for health just because it enables the the body to (%hesitation%) get rid of all the toxic particles toxic companies we keep (y-) on in ourselves
SI114J-00138-P50020 1 SI114J-00138 17.11 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's just an essential habit
SI114J-00138-P50021 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 6.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my case i must say that i'm fond of exercising and formal sports
SI114J-00138-P50021 1 SI114J-00138 6.38 13.32 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i would say that it's absolutely essential to do exercise to exercise every day
SI114J-00138-P50021 1 SI114J-00138 13.32 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think it's really good for health for anyone who want to keep (%hesitation%) to be in good health
SI114J-00138-P50022 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 6.53 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i know that sleeping is essential to regenerate our brains
SI114J-00138-P50022 1 SI114J-00138 6.53 13.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> our brain can't think clearly if it's not regenerated during our sleep
SI114J-00138-P50022 1 SI114J-00138 13.06 18.62 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i don't know if eight hours it's (%hesitation%) it's enough to regenerate
SI114J-00138-P50022 1 SI114J-00138 18.62 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> but in my case it's
SI114J-00138-P50023 1 SI114J-00138 0.00 10.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> well there are some gimmicks related to technology that could enable people to (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) have a positive effect on their health
SI114J-00138-P50023 1 SI114J-00138 10.86 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> but on the whole generally speaking i think that technology has a really negative effect on our lives because it's just keep
SI114J-00146-P10005 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 4.40 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am quite interested in the environment
SI114J-00146-P10005 1 SI114J-00146 4.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in fact i collaborate with a lot of associations which are aware of the climate change and do a lot of activities in order to help the planet like cleaning the rubbish of the beaches for example
SI114J-00146-P10006 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 4.96 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my friends and i really love playing board games
SI114J-00146-P10006 1 SI114J-00146 4.96 17.10 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in fact every weekend they come to my house in order to play while we listen to music (%hesitation%) we eat sweets and chips
SI114J-00146-P10006 1 SI114J-00146 17.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we really love this plan
SI114J-00146-P10007 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 6.76 <o,Q5,B2,P1> without any doubt the person i am most similar to is my dad
SI114J-00146-P10007 1 SI114J-00146 6.76 14.18 <o,Q5,B2,P1> both of us are very sensitive and we are also very patient
SI114J-00146-P10007 1 SI114J-00146 14.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we also love stay in and watch science fiction films
SI114J-00146-P10008 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 12.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> despite the fact i have travel a lot around the world i would like to live in the city where i was born that is to say malaga
SI114J-00146-P10008 1 SI114J-00146 12.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love the climate and the friendly people who lives here
SI114J-00146-P30017 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 17.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00146-P30017 1 SI114J-00146 17.31 24.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however it is true that students have to study a lot of different subjects
SI114J-00146-P30017 1 SI114J-00146 24.02 39.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so if there was time to do fitness classes they would have less time in order to study the other type of subjects like maths or english
SI114J-00146-P30017 1 SI114J-00146 39.88 45.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> from my point of view however i think it is a good idea
SI114J-00146-P30017 1 SI114J-00146 45.43 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in fact some months ago i was working in a school and i proposed this initiative in order to encourage sport and good life
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 12.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the following diagram it is possible to see how honey is produced by bees and how it is carried to the supermarket
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 12.30 21.71 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from different flowers and make honey from this nectar in the beehive
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 21.71 30.83 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as you can see in the third picture the beekeepers are the ones who collect the honey from this beehive
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 30.83 40.38 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after it the honey is put into some pots which are then carried in big trucks to the supermarkets
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 40.38 52.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the pots are collocated in the shelves by the shop assistants in order to be bought by every person who wants to eat some honey
SI114J-00146-P40018 1 SI114J-00146 52.75 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as you can see it is an easy process
SI114J-00146-P50019 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 6.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the student should be aware of the personality and interests
SI114J-00146-P50019 1 SI114J-00146 6.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they like to (go-) going out at night they should choose a different place to those students who prefer a relaxed and calm atmosphere
SI114J-00146-P50020 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 14.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> without any doubt the best advantage of studying in a second language is that students can highly improve their level of english for example
SI114J-00146-P50020 1 SI114J-00146 14.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can improve all the different skills of the new language
SI114J-00146-P50021 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 10.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> without any doubt the bigger difficulty that students can have is the level of the language
SI114J-00146-P50021 1 SI114J-00146 10.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if their level is not very good they can have problems in order to study subjects and meet new people
SI114J-00146-P50022 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 9.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> from my point of view the best way to learn about the local culture is by meeting someone who lives there
SI114J-00146-P50022 1 SI114J-00146 9.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in this way this person could really show students the good restaurants and typical food of that country
SI114J-00146-P50023 1 SI114J-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i really agree with this statement because from my point of view i was living abroad last year for five months and i think that nowadays i am much more independent and i am also very open minded and autonomous
SI114J-00147-P10005 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 6.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm really interested in learning about other countries and other cultures
SI114J-00147-P10005 1 SI114J-00147 6.44 10.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love to travel is one of my of my biggest hobbies
SI114J-00147-P10005 1 SI114J-00147 10.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) always that i have some time i like to travel mostly to asia because i think they have a really different (scen-)
SI114J-00147-P10006 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 6.51 <o,Q5,B2,P1> at my leisure time i like to go to the to the beach
SI114J-00147-P10006 1 SI114J-00147 6.51 15.97 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) here in valencia we have a really nice weather so (%hesitation%) we can go to the beach from may to september
SI114J-00147-P10006 1 SI114J-00147 15.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love to go there play football and that (ki-)
SI114J-00147-P10007 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 10.18 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i am willing to improve my english one of the things that (%hesitation%) i think it works better is to use this application speak and improve
SI114J-00147-P10007 1 SI114J-00147 10.18 14.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> also i like to use a writing application called writing and improve
SI114J-00147-P10007 1 SI114J-00147 14.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that way i could i could improve my english without moving
SI114J-00147-P10008 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 15.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if it was possible i would love to learn how to cook better mostly because i would like to invite my friends to my home and prepare them a good meal
SI114J-00147-P10008 1 SI114J-00147 15.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would love to learn an italian cuisine
SI114J-00147-P30017 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 11.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are plenty of advantage of advantage (%hesitation%) of of having part time jobs when you're a student
SI114J-00147-P30017 1 SI114J-00147 11.29 20.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example one of the advantage is that you have (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) money for spending in your leisure time
SI114J-00147-P30017 1 SI114J-00147 20.12 36.34 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and also it will give the the students (%hesitation%) a way to increase other skills that they cannot (%hesitation%) increase by the study itself
SI114J-00147-P30017 1 SI114J-00147 36.34 51.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) as a disadvantage the main disadvantage is that you will students that work have less time for for studying than those who who don't
SI114J-00147-P30017 1 SI114J-00147 51.23 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) in my opinion is better to use use all your time to study instead of

SI114J-00147-P40018 1 SI114J-00147 9.86 19.39 <o,Q3,B2,P4> acid rain is created through it's the consequence of pollution from factories and vehicles
SI114J-00147-P40018 1 SI114J-00147 19.39 28.03 <o,Q3,B2,P4> it goes up with the smoke and (mo-) it's moved by the by the winds by the wind
SI114J-00147-P40018 1 SI114J-00147 28.03 40.72 <o,Q3,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) when clouds are created with (%hesitation%) the preparation of the of water (%hesitation%) they are (ins-) inside the cloud

SI114J-00147-P40018 1 SI114J-00147 45.73 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P4> instead of being a clear water it will be a polluted water that will affect the environment and like from trees and from animals
SI114J-00147-P50019 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 14.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as an advice can i give to to the people is (%hesitation%) they should eat at least five pieces of fruits and vegetables every day
SI114J-00147-P50019 1 SI114J-00147 14.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also to develop a good eating (ha-) habit you have to
SI114J-00147-P50020 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 8.17 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i believe it's really important to drink a lot of water because (y-) our body is seventy percent water

SI114J-00147-P50020 1 SI114J-00147 15.80 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> also it say you have to drink about two litre of water
SI114J-00147-P50021 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 5.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i believe is need to do some sport every day
SI114J-00147-P50021 1 SI114J-00147 5.19 16.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also you can do it you can do other kind of exercise such as training stretching exercise
SI114J-00147-P50021 1 SI114J-00147 16.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but you have to do some cardio or (o-)
SI114J-00147-P50022 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 5.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i hardly i strongly believe in that statement
SI114J-00147-P50022 1 SI114J-00147 5.51 17.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we need to be in order to be more efficient in our daily life we have to be (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to have a good sleeping all the days

SI114J-00147-P50023 1 SI114J-00147 0.00 4.33 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion it has a positive effect
SI114J-00147-P50023 1 SI114J-00147 4.33 15.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) this is because so we can use technology to develop a better healthy healthy (s-) system
SI114J-00147-P50023 1 SI114J-00147 15.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we can give technology to our doctors to be more effective
SI114J-00149-P10005 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 6.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am really interesting in learning i am really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00149-P10005 1 SI114J-00149 6.45 12.68 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in fact i have been one year in florence where i did my erasmus and it was a great experience
SI114J-00149-P10005 1 SI114J-00149 12.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i was there i also travelled to other countries as france or germany
SI114J-00149-P10006 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 7.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my free time i like playing sports with my friends such as basketball football or tennis
SI114J-00149-P10006 1 SI114J-00149 7.60 10.64 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i also love films
SI114J-00149-P10006 1 SI114J-00149 10.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for this reason i try to when when it's possible i try to go to the cinema in order to watch some films
SI114J-00149-P10007 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 3.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my opinion the best way is reading
SI114J-00149-P10007 1 SI114J-00149 3.95 4.92 <o,Q5,B2,P1> why reading
SI114J-00149-P10007 1 SI114J-00149 4.92 16.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> because when you are reading you are you are (disc-) you discover new words and also the words that you know before you are knowing how to put in a context
SI114J-00149-P10007 1 SI114J-00149 16.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also you are knowing the grammar structure the grammatical
SI114J-00149-P10008 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 7.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it will be dancing because i love dance
SI114J-00149-P10008 1 SI114J-00149 7.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> however i don't dance good so for this reason it will be nice for me to take some classes some lessons because i am i i enjoy a lot when i did but i am a little bad at at it
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 9.53 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the one hand could be a good idea because they could get experience that is very important for his for their future
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 9.53 15.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> and maybe they could get (%hesitation%) easier a work after having some experience
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 15.88 30.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also they can know (%hesitation%) they can really know if they are studying something that they they like because when you because it's very different work (tha-) work than study these are a little bit different
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 30.58 39.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but on the other hand could be (b-) bad because could be very stressful for them because it's very early to it's very early working at these at these ages
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 39.00 50.05 <o,Q4,C,P3> so ok for my point of view i think it will be a good idea because experience is the most important thing when you are looking for a job
SI114J-00149-P30017 1 SI114J-00149 50.05 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so so i think they can they can take advantage of it when they when they will look for for a job in the future
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 13.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> ok first firstly all the things that produce pollution such as factories vehicles engines ok these when they are working they produce pollution
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 13.15 20.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this pollution go up to the air and in there in that moment they become particles
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 20.91 25.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> okay when they are particles they are carried by the wind
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 25.30 33.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> okay they are carried the wind and they mix with the clouds okay these particles are mixed with the clouds
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 33.18 49.65 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and if this day it's raining this rain is going to is going to contain these particles these acid these particles we can say acid particles and these acid particles are going down are going are fall down to the to the earth
SI114J-00149-P40018 1 SI114J-00149 49.65 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this is going to be this is dangerous because can damage the environment and also can harm the population
SI114J-00149-P50019 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 11.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> okay my advice would be not buy not buy (%hesitation%) junk food at the supermarket because if you don't buy it you avoid
SI114J-00149-P50019 1 SI114J-00149 11.84 17.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't take risk of looking in your shelves or in your fridge oh i have this
SI114J-00149-P50019 1 SI114J-00149 17.24 17.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> no
SI114J-00149-P50019 1 SI114J-00149 17.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so avoid that
SI114J-00149-P50020 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 14.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (real-) i think it's really important drinking water every day because (%hesitation%) this pull out all the bad substances that you that you are drinking during the day
SI114J-00149-P50020 1 SI114J-00149 14.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's really important
SI114J-00149-P50021 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 14.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's good doing exercise but is not is not essential because if you do exercise but after that you eat junk food you are not going to have result and you are going you are not going to have a healthy living
SI114J-00149-P50021 1 SI114J-00149 14.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's important to mix (s-) exercise with good (%hesitation%) health healthy
SI114J-00149-P50022 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 12.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> sleeping also as far as i'm concerned i'm very (imp-) is very important because when you sleep well the day after you are very energetic you are happier you (ca-) you are very productive
SI114J-00149-P50022 1 SI114J-00149 12.17 16.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think you you can study more also
SI114J-00149-P50022 1 SI114J-00149 16.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i mean you have a a healthier (sel-)
SI114J-00149-P50023 1 SI114J-00149 0.00 4.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> on the hand can have a positive impact
SI114J-00149-P50023 1 SI114J-00149 4.43 15.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean (%hesitation%) you can watch a lot of (%hesitation%) videos on youtube where you can get advice so (c-) so (ca-) how can you get a healthy life
SI114J-00149-P50023 1 SI114J-00149 15.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but on the other hand it's bad for sleeping because because see a lot of time
SI114J-00156-P10005 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 5.90 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm really interested in music
SI114J-00156-P10005 1 SI114J-00156 5.90 15.39 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's one of the best ways to pass your free time listening music
SI114J-00156-P10005 1 SI114J-00156 15.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i i used to work with music too
SI114J-00156-P10006 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love to travel to different places (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) i i like to go to other countries (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) to know other cities other cultures
SI114J-00156-P10008 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it will it will help me a lot because english nowadays is necessary (%hesitation%) for work and (%hesitation%) and because (%hesitation%) i i i have to travel a lot
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 10.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think that to study a foreign language has a lot of of advantage
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 10.05 15.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i i am not sure (%hesitation%) like
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 15.67 26.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because you can work (%hesitation%) with foreign people or you (lu-) you you you can work in other country
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 26.92 33.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but i am not sure if you have to to do it at the university
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 33.60 50.01 <o,Q4,B2,P3> maybe is a best option because (%hesitation%) you will spend time with that and at you will no you will not study other other things
SI114J-00156-P30017 1 SI114J-00156 50.01 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) maybe it's it's better to do it (%hesitation%) in your free time
SI114J-00156-P50019 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 15.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the best way to find out (%hesitation%) international news is (%hesitation%) to search on the national (%hesitation%) online newspaper
SI114J-00156-P50019 1 SI114J-00156 15.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) there you can find a lot of
SI114J-00156-P50020 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't agree with that (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) nowadays there are a lot of (%hesitation%) online newspaper but (%hesitation%) printed newspaper (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) continue continue
SI114J-00156-P50021 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 15.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that social medica (%hesitation%) sho social media is not a reliable (%hesitation%) way to to (ha-) to know about what happen
SI114J-00156-P50021 1 SI114J-00156 15.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) because (y-) you
SI114J-00156-P50022 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i i know that it can be good to to know how to know what's happening in your local area (%hesitation%) so it it i think that's important
SI114J-00156-P50023 1 SI114J-00156 0.00 13.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i agree with that but if if if there is bad news then this is because bad things are happening
SI114J-00156-P50023 1 SI114J-00156 13.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's good to know what's happening in the world
SI114J-00157-P10005 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 5.53 <o,Q5,C,P1> my city is a medium sized town situated by the river
SI114J-00157-P10005 1 SI114J-00157 5.53 7.76 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's a quiet area
SI114J-00157-P10005 1 SI114J-00157 7.76 13.14 <o,Q5,C,P1> people are friendly and there are a number of shops and facilities
SI114J-00157-P10005 1 SI114J-00157 13.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) however (%hesitation%) there are a few cinemas and (%hesitation%) there are no shopping
SI114J-00157-P10006 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 7.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i enjoy relaxing and knowing that i don't have to stick to any timetable
SI114J-00157-P10006 1 SI114J-00157 7.94 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like spending my holidays by the sea where i can breathe fresh air go for a work sit in the sun and maybe play beach volleyball
SI114J-00157-P10007 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 9.98 <o,Q5,C,P1> i really like spending quality time with my only son because we have (%hesitation%) many interests in common
SI114J-00157-P10007 1 SI114J-00157 9.98 15.98 <o,Q5,C,P1> for instance we love music and we love going for walks by the river
SI114J-00157-P10007 1 SI114J-00157 15.98 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i think he is the person i like to be with
SI114J-00157-P10008 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 2.15 <o,Q5,C,P1> i already have a job
SI114J-00157-P10008 1 SI114J-00157 2.15 13.04 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am a teacher and i don't think that i would like to change that job because i have been a teacher for a very long time and i really like being a teacher
SI114J-00157-P10008 1 SI114J-00157 13.04 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i decided to be a teacher long ago so i don't think my job will be different in the future
SI114J-00157-P30017 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 14.94 <o,Q5,C,P3> ok i think that students should get a part time job (%hesitation%) to pay for their university studies to help their parents and to learn what (%hesitation%) working and earning a living is like
SI114J-00157-P30017 1 SI114J-00157 14.94 28.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the drawbacks would be that students maybe would have less time to study and could be like really worn out (%hesitation%) at the day of a working day
SI114J-00157-P30017 1 SI114J-00157 28.21 33.84 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i suppose the advantages outweigh the disadvantages
SI114J-00157-P30017 1 SI114J-00157 33.84 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> students may manage their time and work and study at the same time and it will be it will prove to be really profitable at the end because not only will they make some money to pay for their studies but they will also gain valuable experience and they will help their parents support them
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 4.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> ok first of all you need to get to the airport
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 4.22 9.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can do so by car by bus or even by train
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 9.62 19.10 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) once you arrive at the airport you need to check in at the check in desk where you check in your luggage and show your passport
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 19.10 34.27 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that you go through document control passport control and security where (%hesitation%) things are checked because you know that some things are banned from carrying into the plane
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 34.27 49.34 <o,Q5,C,P4> after you have gone through all this procedure you may wait at the lounge where you can use the toilet have something to eat or drink and relax and only with the (%hesitation%) hand luggage
SI114J-00157-P40018 1 SI114J-00157 49.34 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> finally you get on board of the plane where you find your seat put your luggage on the overboard (%hesitation%) overhead
SI114J-00157-P50019 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 6.52 <o,Q5,C,P5> well technology is really useful nowadays especially computers
SI114J-00157-P50019 1 SI114J-00157 6.52 13.29 <o,Q5,C,P5> they can (d-) look for information interact with the teachers do their homework
SI114J-00157-P50019 1 SI114J-00157 13.29 17.62 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i guess technology is vital in today's education
SI114J-00157-P50019 1 SI114J-00157 17.62 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it all depends on the tasks
SI114J-00157-P50020 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 17.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> no doubt face to face communication can't be replaced by any device but if face to face communication can't occur well there are some other alternatives like (%hesitation%) some platforms like zoom
SI114J-00157-P50020 1 SI114J-00157 17.16 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but no doubt physical contact is
SI114J-00157-P50021 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> they will certainly (%hesitation%) learn how to co operate and group work with (ch-) other with each other and they will also learn how to share experiences interact exchange ideas come to an agreement and work out problems
SI114J-00157-P50022 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 13.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would agree that attending lectures is really profitable because (%hesitation%) i mean and it's like more entertaining and but you can also read on your own and collect information
SI114J-00157-P50022 1 SI114J-00157 13.88 18.78 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think that both have (%hesitation%) good things to consider
SI114J-00157-P50022 1 SI114J-00157 18.78 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> attending lectures is
SI114J-00157-P50023 1 SI114J-00157 0.00 7.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i would say it is essential (%hesitation%) to make students learn in a good environment
SI114J-00157-P50023 1 SI114J-00157 7.44 15.02 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the more at ease students feel the more they learn and they more they will stay focused
SI114J-00157-P50023 1 SI114J-00157 15.02 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so learning facilities are essential to make students make progress
SI114J-00161-P10005 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 14.44 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love the environment and we need to take care because (%hesitation%) there are many (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) worse effects if we have (%hesitation%) a bad environment
SI114J-00161-P10005 1 SI114J-00161 14.44 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so our childs and our answer will be kill off
SI114J-00161-P10006 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 7.21 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i love sports and all around them the competivity teamwork make new friends
SI114J-00161-P10006 1 SI114J-00161 7.21 11.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and during my life i've played (%hesitation%) football
SI114J-00161-P10006 1 SI114J-00161 11.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i also like (%hesitation%) do hiking with my friends and breathe fresh air
SI114J-00161-P10007 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 15.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well probably the most similar to me it will be my father because we share we share the sport we share the the likes of (%hesitation%) the gastronomy
SI114J-00161-P10007 1 SI114J-00161 15.69 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and yeah my father
SI114J-00161-P10008 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> probably i will choose spain as a country and the city would probably choose cadiz because you have too many interest places you have the sea good weather and a fantastic gastronomy
SI114J-00161-P30017 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 26.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> okay if you're questioning me about the schools and college should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes i will say you that in the main advantage (%hesitation%) i've found (%hesitation%) it will be that they will (%hesitation%) very healthy life with the with this (%hesitation%) with the kind of initiative
SI114J-00161-P30017 1 SI114J-00161 26.57 38.61 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because (%hesitation%) they will take a routine in (hi-) in (hi-) they lives and probably they will continue in all all over the the life
SI114J-00161-P30017 1 SI114J-00161 38.61 41.11 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are no disadvantage bad
SI114J-00161-P30017 1 SI114J-00161 41.11 49.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand they will spend time doing the fitness classes that it will not (%hesitation%) apply to to study
SI114J-00161-P30017 1 SI114J-00161 49.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so definitely in my opinion school make make time in
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 8.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 8.46 13.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all we can see that bees collect (ne-) nectar from flowers
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 13.52 22.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's a natural process in which (%hesitation%) bees climb to the flowers and catch the nectar
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 22.99 27.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that we can see that bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 27.71 30.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's a natural process
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 30.23 37.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the third diagram we can see beekeepers collecting honey from beehives
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 37.42 45.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that will produce the nectar and introduce to be manufactured in (%hesitation%) bottles
SI114J-00161-P40018 1 SI114J-00161 45.97 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the bottles will be transport to shops and woohoo we can buy it
SI114J-00161-P50019 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in my in my opinion (%hesitation%) i would probably choose a country with a good weather and a good level of the universities because the (%hesitation%) it's more it's more important for me
SI114J-00161-P50020 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so definitely it's it's a good way to to do it in (%hesitation%) in another country because we can get more confidence with that language and we improve our skills (%hesitation%) with with that (%hesitation%) second language
SI114J-00161-P50022 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i consider that the local culture will be learnt through through the people that that lives in (%hesitation%) that country so speaking with the people certain comments and walking by the city
SI114J-00161-P50023 1 SI114J-00161 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i i totally agree with that because if you have the decision to to travel in another country with another language and you can defeated all all the goals you definitely becomes more impen independent
SI114J-00164-P10005 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 3.20 <o,Q5,C,P1> time of the year is spring
SI114J-00164-P10005 1 SI114J-00164 3.20 17.17 <o,Q5,C,P1> mainly because i don't really enjoy the cold season so when that finishes spring goes to a new place and also i'm finishing school and i think that all the flowers are beautiful
SI114J-00164-P10005 1 SI114J-00164 17.17 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and it starts to be very (chil-)
SI114J-00164-P10006 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 4.09 <o,Q4,C,P1> i don't have it as my first priority
SI114J-00164-P10006 1 SI114J-00164 4.09 11.95 <o,Q4,C,P1> but i think it's cumbersome not to be inform constantly since for example in the app twitter
SI114J-00164-P10006 1 SI114J-00164 11.95 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> it is important to be (%hesitation%) constantly inform of what is happening internationally
SI114J-00164-P10007 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 6.79 <o,Q5,C,P1> child i'd like to go outside and play with people in the park
SI114J-00164-P10007 1 SI114J-00164 6.79 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would play with other children that play imaginary with sand or sticks and we had a great time with imagination mainly and not indoors
SI114J-00164-P10008 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 5.31 <o,Q4,C,P1> hope to be working in the production industry or the film industry
SI114J-00164-P10008 1 SI114J-00164 5.31 12.61 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i am very interested in the communication and media and the audiovisual things
SI114J-00164-P10008 1 SI114J-00164 12.61 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so i would like to work in that and or anything related to films as an actress or a writer
SI114J-00164-P30017 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 5.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> i'm personally a quite a fan of practical work experience
SI114J-00164-P30017 1 SI114J-00164 5.74 9.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think there's a lot of (advan-) advantages to it
SI114J-00164-P30017 1 SI114J-00164 9.31 22.33 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if you're in an engineer career or something relate to science such as biology i think it is verily (%hesitation%) way not to get yourself involved in this
SI114J-00164-P30017 1 SI114J-00164 22.33 43.94 <o,Q5,C,P3> and also i think it would be cumbersome if you're learning something and not to see the practical way of it because even if you understand a lot of theory and when you get into the real world you've never touched that in real life it could be very hard to do your work properly
SI114J-00164-P30017 1 SI114J-00164 43.94 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's a great way to see it both ways (theor-) theoretically and practically because you might not understand something in (%hesitation%) class but when you see it in real life it can make a lot of sense and it can make things easier
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 7.48 <o,Q5,C,P4> i will be giving a presentation about people visiting three new online pop music sites
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 7.48 14.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> this three music sites that we're talking about are tunes net music now and songs for you
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 14.95 18.89 <o,Q5,C,P4> this have way different ways to start
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 18.89 35.34 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) music now and songs for you started in a really similar way besides from tunes net that is starting in a pretty low and finished unlike the others in a total opposite side reaching about hundreds of thousand people watching them
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 35.34 48.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> (w-) when you're watching songs for you they had a really worse way of people in audience which they decreased and (n-) not a bad level but it still touch and affect them
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 48.11 58.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00164-P40018 1 SI114J-00164 58.41 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> tunes net is the best one
SI114J-00164-P50019 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 17.22 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the person who doesn't find it cumbersome to listen to different kinds of opinions so that the group can have different perspectives and points of view so that everyone can get what they want and their view on the project
SI114J-00164-P50019 1 SI114J-00164 17.22 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00164-P50020 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 8.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> i seldom think that there's big problems with small teams since i think it's a great amount of people
SI114J-00164-P50020 1 SI114J-00164 8.13 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but the biggest problem i can think of it's when it's a bigger project than the amount of people's time and skills can do so they can do all the projects
SI114J-00164-P50021 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 7.52 <o,Q5,C,P5> i do think that it should be encouraged but when it all comes in a respectful way
SI114J-00164-P50021 1 SI114J-00164 7.52 12.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> i do think that everyone can be beneficial if they listen to each other
SI114J-00164-P50021 1 SI114J-00164 12.63 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so if they are not coming to an end of a problem they can listen to different ideas and get to it
SI114J-00164-P50022 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 8.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think it needs to be physically face to face considering that nowadays everything has been doing online
SI114J-00164-P50022 1 SI114J-00164 8.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i quite think that (un-) unless you are in (%hesitation%) would you have a physical problem all you need is to hear and that the (com-) communication is clear
SI114J-00164-P50023 1 SI114J-00164 0.00 9.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> i consider this as depending on the project and the kind of person with an amount of skills
SI114J-00164-P50023 1 SI114J-00164 9.41 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i don't agree with the fact that it is better to be alone than with team since you don't really lose much with having differents points of view
SI114J-00166-P10005 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 17.32 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if i have to choose one i'd rather to stay all time on summer because i love put clothes on that are very fresh
SI114J-00166-P10005 1 SI114J-00166 17.32 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i think they stay more
SI114J-00166-P10006 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 3.98 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am taking in
SI114J-00166-P10006 1 SI114J-00166 3.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i was i have never been interested on news but i think it's quite important to know what happen now and what happened in the past
SI114J-00166-P10007 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i was a child i remember annoying all time at my sister and playing with my cousin and it was very funny
SI114J-00166-P10008 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i hope will work at nurse because i love to care of the others and help and listen the problems that people have
SI114J-00166-P30017 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 30.41 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i believe the degrees are worse prepared than another grades because they don't (%hesitation%) dedicate the importance that the practical work experience have to students to prepare for the future work
SI114J-00166-P30017 1 SI114J-00166 30.41 53.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and i think they should (%hesitation%) make point on practical because for the future will be better for all the students and the progress of the different works
SI114J-00166-P30017 1 SI114J-00166 53.23 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00166-P40018 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 15.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> on this chart we can see the the progress about the visitors (%hesitation%) consult the new online pop music sites
SI114J-00166-P40018 1 SI114J-00166 15.59 31.63 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and it it is very important to mention at first that the music now are the most (%hesitation%) visited (%hesitation%) during the the week
SI114J-00166-P40018 1 SI114J-00166 31.63 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> but (%hesitation%) on the other hand on the fifth day as music now and song four you have been having an important decrease instead of (%hesitation%) tunes net that on the fifth day have a important increase on the visits
SI114J-00166-P50019 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> personally for be the leader of the team (%hesitation%) you have to have a strong character and decision to make up (%hesitation%) your mind and
SI114J-00166-P50020 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the main (proble-) problem of that it is on small teams perhaps there are less ideas than in a big group
SI114J-00166-P50021 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i believe that the disagree arguments (%hesitation%) between the members of the group are very good because they come will come up with different
SI114J-00166-P50022 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it is not necessary really but i think it is important and better for the future work
SI114J-00166-P50022 1 SI114J-00166 11.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because face to face you can discuss with the others and propose some different
SI114J-00166-P50023 1 SI114J-00166 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think on (%hesitation%) alone work you probably get better marks but for they for yourself it's better working together
SI114J-00171-P10005 1 SI114J-00171 0.00 9.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i live in a small village where there are a lot of parks

SI114J-00176-P50022 1 SI114J-00176 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the important of local news because is important (%hesitation%) know the news in my (%hesitation%) country or in my town
SI114J-00176-P50023 1 SI114J-00176 0.00 6.06 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think (%hesitation%) i agree the opinion
SI114J-00176-P50023 1 SI114J-00176 6.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the more people (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) the news bad because is the life is they is (%hesitation%) (f-)
SI114J-00183-P10005 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 3.06 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm very interested in the evironments
SI114J-00183-P10005 1 SI114J-00183 3.06 19.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> actually in the last few months i have been becoming more and more interested in this subjects because i've had more time to think of my impacts of the impact of my actions in the world we live in
SI114J-00183-P10005 1 SI114J-00183 19.03 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i've actually
SI114J-00183-P10006 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 9.38 <o,Q5,C,P1> we enjoy going to the cinema because i am in a documentary course so we really love to watch movies
SI114J-00183-P10006 1 SI114J-00183 9.38 17.93 <o,Q5,C,P1> we also love to go to bars and get some beers and talk about life and about movies for a little bits
SI114J-00183-P10006 1 SI114J-00183 17.93 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and we also just love (t-)
SI114J-00183-P10007 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 16.20 <o,Q5,C,P1> i believe that i am most similar to my aunts from my mother's side because we have a lot of the same interests and we are actually a little similar similar like physically speaking
SI114J-00183-P10007 1 SI114J-00183 16.20 19.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> and we have a lot of the same allergies
SI114J-00183-P10007 1 SI114J-00183 19.64 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and
SI114J-00183-P10008 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 18.40 <o,Q5,C,P1> i actually don't have a straight answer to this question because i think that i am too young to actually know where i wanna live (%hesitation%) but maybe somewhere in europe like italy or france or maybe even in my island
SI114J-00183-P10008 1 SI114J-00183 18.40 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i don't know where life's gonna
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 6.55 <o,Q3,C,P3> first of all i believe that schools and colleges are two very differents kinds of institutions
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 6.55 19.59 <o,Q3,C,P3> i think that it could be very advantageous for schools to make time for fitness classes because the students would get this habits of working out every day
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 19.59 31.39 <o,Q3,C,P3> but maybe in colleges it wouldn't be that advantageous because at this time students are older and if they want to work out they'll just do it in their own time
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 31.39 40.60 <o,Q3,C,P3> and i think that if colleges would actually make time for students to do fitness classes they probably wouldn't do it
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 40.60 47.85 <o,Q3,C,P3> and they would maybe just study or rest or or go have a beer or something like that
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 47.85 50.90 <o,Q3,C,P3> so i think it's it depends
SI114J-00183-P30017 1 SI114J-00183 50.90 60.00 <o,Q3,C,P3> i think on the younger students it make sense but in older ones it's it doesn't make that much sense
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 3.85 <o,Q3,C,P4> so now i'm going to explain how honey is produced
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 3.85 14.13 <o,Q3,C,P4> so the bees they they go around the flowers and when they step on them they collect nectar
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 14.13 21.68 <o,Q3,C,P4> and then they go on to their beehives and make honey from the nectar in the beehives
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 21.68 27.38 <o,Q3,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after that the beekeepers collect the honey
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 27.38 34.43 <o,Q3,C,P4> and they put them in jars or bottles or whatever you find in the supermarket
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 34.43 43.20 <o,Q3,C,P4> then these containers are taken to the store by a van or something like that
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 43.20 47.44 <o,Q3,C,P4> and then you find the honey in the shop
SI114J-00183-P40018 1 SI114J-00183 47.44 60.00 <o,Q3,C,P4> and that's basically how honey is made
SI114J-00183-P50019 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 13.71 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that students should firstly consider the type of lifestyle they wanna lead and if this country matches (%hesitation%) their their way of living
SI114J-00183-P50019 1 SI114J-00183 13.71 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and they should also consider the course they're going to coz it's very important
SI114J-00183-P50020 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 8.83 <o,Q3,C,P5> i think it's (%hesitation%) actually very beneficial for students to study in a second language coz you get to develop its further
SI114J-00183-P50020 1 SI114J-00183 8.83 15.15 <o,Q3,C,P5> and you also (%hesitation%) think differently actually in a second language
SI114J-00183-P50020 1 SI114J-00183 15.15 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> i think that everyone has a different personality in different languages
SI114J-00183-P50021 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 8.80 <o,Q3,C,P5> i think that studying in another country might be difficult for the students (%hesitation%) mainly because they're far away from their families
SI114J-00183-P50021 1 SI114J-00183 8.80 13.25 <o,Q3,C,P5> and also there's sometimes like an adaptation periods
SI114J-00183-P50021 1 SI114J-00183 13.25 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> so you have to learn the language or at least a little bit of it to (unders-)
SI114J-00183-P50022 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 14.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the the main thing you should do to learn about local culture is to actually talk to people and let them explain to you how their culture works and their past
SI114J-00183-P50022 1 SI114J-00183 14.62 19.16 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that's the most interesting thing to do when you get to a place
SI114J-00183-P50022 1 SI114J-00183 19.16 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's to learn
SI114J-00183-P50023 1 SI114J-00183 0.00 9.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think this is very true because you are suddenly in a different country (wi-) where people don't (s-) speak your language
SI114J-00183-P50023 1 SI114J-00183 9.43 18.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> and you really have to just adapt very quickly and learn to do things by yourself
SI114J-00183-P50023 1 SI114J-00183 18.62 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i think
SI114J-00194-P10005 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 13.89 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00194-P10005 1 SI114J-00194 13.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and so it is important for us to protect the environment
SI114J-00194-P10006 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 7.38 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well my friends and i enjoy listening to various kinds of music on my device (%hesitation%) be it classical or rap
SI114J-00194-P10006 1 SI114J-00194 7.38 11.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> every now and then we go to live performances though prefer gigs to big concerts
SI114J-00194-P10006 1 SI114J-00194 11.91 14.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the atmosphere is more intimate and personal
SI114J-00194-P10006 1 SI114J-00194 14.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in fact i've just taken up piano after i went to a gig
SI114J-00194-P10007 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 3.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> absolutely the person would be my (broth-) brother
SI114J-00194-P10007 1 SI114J-00194 3.60 6.21 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we grew up together and we were inseparable
SI114J-00194-P10007 1 SI114J-00194 6.21 12.17 <o,Q4,B2,P1> he is (%hesitation%) he is so adventurous always on the lookout for the next (a-) (adr-) adrenalin rush
SI114J-00194-P10007 1 SI114J-00194 12.17 13.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> she is not blind to the risks
SI114J-00194-P10007 1 SI114J-00194 13.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> she's just had up for those adventures because she's so stressful
SI114J-00194-P10008 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 4.24 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00194-P10008 1 SI114J-00194 4.24 6.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well it is a highly cosmopolitan city
SI114J-00194-P10008 1 SI114J-00194 6.90 12.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and what i like the most about (%hesitation%) this this is the (%hesitation%) taste and the local food
SI114J-00194-P10008 1 SI114J-00194 12.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) is famous for its (%hesitation%) historic sites and (%hesitation%) beautiful scenery
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 9.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as far as i'm concerned i think (%hesitation%) is of great significance that schools and colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 9.66 12.33 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages are easy to see
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 12.33 28.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) first firstly (%hesitation%) working out regularly and doing aerobic exercises can not only change the sedentary lifestyle that we (%hesitation%) (mo-) modern modern people may have (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) but also be a good way to socialise and build character
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 28.47 41.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> moreover (%hesitation%) keeping a balanced diet and eating plenty of greens and roughages (%hesitation%) which are high in vitamins and proteins and fibre (%hesitation%) can only cut down on fatty and sugary food but also help us stay away from junk food
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 41.48 43.71 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) however there're also disadvantages
SI114J-00194-P30017 1 SI114J-00194 43.71 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example (%hesitation%) we may have a craving for junk food and (%hesitation%) unhealthy food if we don't have more
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 1.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello everyone
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 1.66 6.69 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i feel obliged to give a presentation about how honey is produced
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 6.69 10.08 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the diagram below shows how honey is produced
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 10.08 18.36 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) according to the diagram (%hesitation%) the honey (%hesitation%) is is the first step is that bees collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 18.36 23.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the next step is that bees make money honey from the nectar in beehives
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 23.88 29.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the next (ste-) step is the beekeepers collect mon honey from beehives
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 29.21 39.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the next step is that the beekeepers (%hesitation%) loaded load the honey into some (%hesitation%) bottles that are (%hesitation%) (trans-) transparent transparent
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 39.77 46.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the bottles are (%hesitation%) (transf-) transferred into the shop by some cars and (%hesitation%) vehicles
SI114J-00194-P40018 1 SI114J-00194 46.97 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) in conclusion this is an important diagram that shows us how the honey is improved
SI114J-00194-P50019 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 8.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well there's many there are many factors that should be included when (%hesitation%) considering choosing a country to study
SI114J-00194-P50019 1 SI114J-00194 8.09 13.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the most important one is the environment and the culture there
SI114J-00194-P50019 1 SI114J-00194 13.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if the student couldn't adapt to the culture there it would be hard for him to study there
SI114J-00194-P50020 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 15.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well studying (%hesitation%) second language is definitely a best way to learn another culture and broaden your horizon since we cannot (%hesitation%) stimulate ourselves if if we are (%hesitation%) located we're located
SI114J-00194-P50020 1 SI114J-00194 15.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and studying and learn language is also a very good way
SI114J-00194-P50021 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 10.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for the record i have to say it's (ver-) really tough for china's people to learn english (becau-) because we seldom get any chance to use it in our everyday life
SI114J-00194-P50021 1 SI114J-00194 10.36 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) english is a complete foreign language here and most will rarely use it outside the classroom
SI114J-00194-P50021 1 SI114J-00194 15.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very difficult for to (fluen-)
SI114J-00194-P50022 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 11.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well there's no denying that the (%hesitation%) most efficient and effective way to learn local culture is to search for information on in the internet
SI114J-00194-P50022 1 SI114J-00194 11.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and moreover (%hesitation%) (pe-) students could ask for some ask some local people for the culture too
SI114J-00194-P50023 1 SI114J-00194 0.00 7.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well as far as i am concerned i suppose that on the whole the idea is (%hesitation%) quite right
SI114J-00194-P50023 1 SI114J-00194 7.21 14.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because (%hesitation%) if we want to become independent first we should (%hesitation%) depend ourself and go to another country
SI114J-00194-P50023 1 SI114J-00194 14.26 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and learn a second language can (%hesitation%) help us do that
SI114J-00196-P10005 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 12.43 <o,Q5,C,P1> my boyfriend is is a musician so i really interested in but for me it's very difficult to understand the how the music function
SI114J-00196-P10005 1 SI114J-00196 12.43 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> or how do you do you have the possibility to to create and to be a
SI114J-00196-P10006 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i have to recognise that now i (li-) i'd really like to travel to another countries to know and to to improve my knowledge to increase it
SI114J-00196-P10006 1 SI114J-00196 10.59 18.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> but when i was young i don't i didn't like it because for me it's (%hesitation%) it was very expensive
SI114J-00196-P10006 1 SI114J-00196 18.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i don't i didn't have any
SI114J-00196-P10007 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 16.39 <o,Q5,C,P1> really i i don't like to meet any famous because i really think that the real famous are doctors or are person that really (%hesitation%) we we know it we didn't we with the we don't know it
SI114J-00196-P10007 1 SI114J-00196 16.39 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i really i don't like to meet
SI114J-00196-P10008 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 14.38 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's very important to speak well english because while you are at work you have the necessity to talk with your partners or you're calling customers
SI114J-00196-P10008 1 SI114J-00196 14.38 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so if you don't have the any vocabulary or the grammar good
SI114J-00196-P30017 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 23.09 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think that it's good for the students to to study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course because the main advantage that you have to to do is your open your mind and increase your knowledge about any language in in other country or their culture
SI114J-00196-P30017 1 SI114J-00196 23.09 40.99 <o,Q5,C,P3> but on the other hand the main disadvantage it's seventy to that i suppose it could be (%hesitation%) is the time that you have to invested to increase or to be better in this foreign language
SI114J-00196-P30017 1 SI114J-00196 40.99 53.06 <o,Q5,C,P3> because it's very difficult to (%hesitation%) to give address and to understand all of types all (o-) all of grammar of the foreign language
SI114J-00196-P30017 1 SI114J-00196 53.06 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so my opinion i mean in this type in this theme it's very important for us to place
SI114J-00196-P50019 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 12.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> oh it's a good question but you have a lot of different types of international news like on (s-) new york times or the huffington post
SI114J-00196-P50019 1 SI114J-00196 12.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if you are really interested interested to know international news internet is the best way option
SI114J-00196-P50020 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 1.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well depends
SI114J-00196-P50020 1 SI114J-00196 1.86 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the future of newspaper (%hesitation%) such as i understand now it's it's true that in the future it isn't would be so because the paper is not necessary to waste now
SI114J-00196-P50020 1 SI114J-00196 18.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so internet is
SI114J-00196-P50021 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 5.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) social media's a world to be connect with your friends and with your family
SI114J-00196-P50021 1 SI114J-00196 5.48 12.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but it really it's no important because people show that they want to show
SI114J-00196-P50021 1 SI114J-00196 12.38 18.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00196-P50021 1 SI114J-00196 18.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so maybe it's bad for (u-)
SI114J-00196-P50022 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 8.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (nowa-) nowadays it's very importance to keep the local news because every day the local news change
SI114J-00196-P50022 1 SI114J-00196 8.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so if you don't if you you aren't connected with the local or the notice that view of the news it's very difficult to mean
SI114J-00196-P50023 1 SI114J-00196 0.00 1.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with this
SI114J-00196-P50023 1 SI114J-00196 1.75 12.78 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's true that when you switch on the television on or switch on the radio the majority of the news are bad or are sad news
SI114J-00196-P50023 1 SI114J-00196 12.78 15.03 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't know why is the reason
SI114J-00196-P50023 1 SI114J-00196 15.03 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think it could be a some some part that you
SI114J-00198-P10005 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> i live in a really cute and really cosy and beautiful place
SI114J-00198-P10005 1 SI114J-00198 4.88 9.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it's two room apartment and the most important room i think it's the living room
SI114J-00198-P10005 1 SI114J-00198 9.29 12.73 <o,Q5,C,P1> there are plenty of painting on the white walls
SI114J-00198-P10005 1 SI114J-00198 12.73 16.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's (%hesitation%) the the atmosphere is really comfortable
SI114J-00198-P10005 1 SI114J-00198 16.41 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can invite people and have a good moment in this room
SI114J-00198-P10006 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 7.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> when my i i'm on holiday i enjoy going to the sea because i have no sea in in paris of course to swim a little bit
SI114J-00198-P10006 1 SI114J-00198 7.41 10.12 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like to do some sports and to lose weight
SI114J-00198-P10006 1 SI114J-00198 10.12 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i love to spend time with my (%hesitation%) my friends and my family to go to restaurant for example and to to the bars and to share moments and to create experience
SI114J-00198-P10007 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 5.74 <o,Q5,C,P1> i most enjoy spending time with my girlfriend because she is someone really curious and open minded
SI114J-00198-P10007 1 SI114J-00198 5.74 8.74 <o,Q5,C,P1> should you can talk a lot of subject and matters with her
SI114J-00198-P10007 1 SI114J-00198 8.74 13.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) you can talk about i history philosophy and the news
SI114J-00198-P10007 1 SI114J-00198 13.29 17.39 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's really (s-) (sti-) (%hesitation%) enriching and stimulating for you
SI114J-00198-P10007 1 SI114J-00198 17.39 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> for me it's the best person to spend time with
SI114J-00198-P10008 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 6.49 <o,Q5,C,P1> in the future i would like to be a professional in finance because i really think that finance it's it's really changing
SI114J-00198-P10008 1 SI114J-00198 6.49 10.48 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can learn a lot of thing and face many complex problems
SI114J-00198-P10008 1 SI114J-00198 10.48 17.80 <o,Q5,C,P1> and as a financial you have to be in connection with all all the department of the company so you you have to to share with different kind of people
SI114J-00198-P10008 1 SI114J-00198 17.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's really enriching and stimulating
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 7.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> we have loads of advantages to to to to get job to pay university study i think
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 7.28 19.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> the most important one for me is that you will be able to be more independent from your home from your family and maybe from your bank because you will be able you will be able to pay back and reimburse more easily and quickly your loan for example
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 19.78 23.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> and so it's it will be a good thing to start your professional life
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 23.82 29.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> you you will be able to afford a better life without to have to pay back a loan
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 29.23 41.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> the second point i think is the most important one also the most important one for me is that you will be able to to learn some new skills soft skills especially as negotiation project management and those skill will be really useful during your professional life
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 41.88 54.14 <o,Q5,C,P3> nonetheless there are some disadvantages too and i think the most important one is that you will not be able to you would maybe (l-) miss some time and maybe you are you will have less time to study and you'll risk failing your exam
SI114J-00198-P30017 1 SI114J-00198 54.14 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) (b-) by the way in my opinion is it's important to get to have to pay to have get to get
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 14.93 <o,Q5,C,P4> so i'm sure that everyone loves to go to to other countries to visit other countries and to benefit from the tourism (%hesitation%) opportunities you you have now in your life in all world
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 14.93 22.10 <o,Q5,C,P4> but (%hesitation%) to go to to profit to benefit from those opportunities you have to take plane and taking a plane is not an easy process
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 22.10 25.93 <o,Q5,C,P4> so listen to me carefully and pay attention to to what i will say
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 25.93 39.21 <o,Q5,C,P4> so first the first step is to to go to the airport of course so to from your home to your airport and to to take a bus or cab or train for it and depend on your budget and the time you have (%hesitation%) and you you have to make the choice
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 39.21 43.92 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then at the airport you go you have to go to the check in and to control your bag and the weight of your bag
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 43.92 51.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> eventual you have to go to the document control (%hesitation%) and so be careful bring with you your passport
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 51.23 57.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> and you have then you have to go to the security gate and so follow the instruction carefully
SI114J-00198-P40018 1 SI114J-00198 57.08 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in the waiting room you can and boarding room you can wait
SI114J-00198-P50019 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 4.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) there are loads of ways to use technology to study more effectively

SI114J-00198-P50019 1 SI114J-00198 12.20 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> for example i use speak and improve application on web and it (e-) help me a lot to talk good english
SI114J-00198-P50020 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 13.57 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00198-P50020 1 SI114J-00198 13.57 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but it will be you will be able to ask your own questions to professor and to have a specific and customised answer for you
SI114J-00198-P50021 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> skills student students can develop in working in group project on group project i think would be (%hesitation%) most of that would be soft skills really useful for the professional life as negotiation maybe self control with other (%hesitation%) and maybe you will be able to share to know how to share communicate with people
SI114J-00198-P50022 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 9.12 <o,Q5,C,P5> attending lectures for me far very far more effective than (%hesitation%) listen and learning alone atch at home
SI114J-00198-P50022 1 SI114J-00198 9.12 15.33 <o,Q5,C,P5> because in attending lecture you will be you will you will benefit from the insight of the professor and teacher
SI114J-00198-P50022 1 SI114J-00198 15.33 16.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it will be
SI114J-00198-P50022 1 SI114J-00198 16.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> he knows exactly what are the tricky parts and he will help
SI114J-00198-P50023 1 SI114J-00198 0.00 4.89 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my view it's it's really crucial to to provide modern facilities to students
SI114J-00198-P50023 1 SI114J-00198 4.89 16.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> because for example to the access to the technology it's important because you need technology to find new information and you to to be able to read news and to be (c-) connected with others i mean
SI114J-00198-P50023 1 SI114J-00198 16.47 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you have to provide the service different which is different
SI114J-00200-P10005 1 SI114J-00200 0.00 2.50 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i live in a big city

SI114J-00200-P10007 1 SI114J-00200 17.16 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i wish he was here
SI114J-00200-P10008 1 SI114J-00200 0.00 7.13 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would love to work as a french teacher in a foreign country
SI114J-00200-P10008 1 SI114J-00200 7.13 9.16 <o,Q5,C,P1> that's the dream job for me
SI114J-00200-P10008 1 SI114J-00200 9.16 14.22 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) teaching is what i love the most in life
SI114J-00200-P10008 1 SI114J-00200 14.22 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and teaching second second languages like french and english (%hesitation%) in a foreign country
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 0.00 11.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think to work part time for students to pay their university studies to pay the fees it's very good
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 11.45 16.26 <o,Q5,C,P3> actually i think that (%hesitation%) the advantages are huge
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 16.26 33.26 <o,Q5,C,P3> for one hand they can pay their university studies and the fees and (f-) in on on the other hand they can get (%hesitation%) they can get lots of experience working also in these jobs
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 33.26 43.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) the only disadvantages i think (%hesitation%) they can find it's that they waste time working instead of studying
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 43.98 50.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> but overall i think it's a very good idea to get jobs to pay their student's fees
SI114J-00200-P30017 1 SI114J-00200 50.78 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i will do the same as well otherwise my parents will have to pay for it
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 0.00 5.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all to travel by plane you need to travel to the airport
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 5.98 10.50 <o,Q5,C,P4> you need to get a taxi or a bus or a train to get to the airport
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 10.50 14.44 <o,Q5,C,P4> one time you get to the airport you have to check in
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 14.44 19.64 <o,Q5,C,P4> secondly you have to pass the control the document control
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 19.64 23.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> you have to show your passport and pass the security guards
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 23.95 34.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> one time you do this you can wait at the restaurants to go to the restroom or have lunch there in the restaurant
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 34.97 39.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> and finally you can board
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 39.23 43.52 <o,Q5,C,P4> for boarding you need to show your passing board
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 43.52 50.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you can sit and choose a place to sit next to the window
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 50.95 58.06 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) and finally the plane will take off
SI114J-00200-P40018 1 SI114J-00200 58.06 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so
SI114J-00200-P50019 1 SI114J-00200 0.00 5.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology can help students to study more effective
SI114J-00200-P50019 1 SI114J-00200 5.21 8.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for one hand technology can help you
SI114J-00200-P50019 1 SI114J-00200 8.98 17.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> like wifi you can use it to find information for your work at college
SI114J-00200-P50019 1 SI114J-00200 17.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> on the other hand you can

SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 2.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> there are some advantages
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 2.61 10.97 <o,Q5,C,P3> first first they can find that earning money is not easy
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 10.97 15.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think they will be they will stop wasting money
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 15.52 23.97 <o,Q5,C,P3> moreover they can make a friends and they can acquire the skills and the knowledge

SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 28.70 32.08 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand there are some disadvantages
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 32.08 40.20 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) some people say that university student should focus on their schoolwork
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 40.20 51.08 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) if they have their part time job they will they cannot spend enough time to study at home
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 51.08 54.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i agree with this idea
SI114J-00210-P30017 1 SI114J-00210 54.37 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> the the experience will helpful for their future
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 4.36 <o,Q4,C,P4> i'm going to give a presentation about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 4.36 7.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> i explain what you need to do travel by airplane
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 7.98 16.58 <o,Q4,C,P4> first of all you need to get to the airport by bus car taxi or train
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 16.58 18.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> first check in
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 18.16 19.45 <o,Q4,C,P4> you needed to check in
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 19.45 23.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> there you pass your baggage
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 23.98 33.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> then at the document control you have to you need to have a passport and show them
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 33.42 38.21 <o,Q4,C,P4> and security check your bag will will be checked
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 38.21 40.75 <o,Q4,C,P4> and you can wait
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 40.75 46.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> there (i-) there are some restroom restaurant gift shop and a cafe
SI114J-00210-P40018 1 SI114J-00210 46.09 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the boarding time start you can take you can board your airplane
SI114J-00210-P50019 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 5.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> to study more effectively the students can use technology
SI114J-00210-P50019 1 SI114J-00210 5.86 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> for example when they want to improve their english speaking skill they can talk with computer
SI114J-00210-P50020 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 2.92 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree with this idea
SI114J-00210-P50020 1 SI114J-00210 2.92 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> if the students get the questions they can solve the problem immediately by talking with their teacher
SI114J-00210-P50021 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> on group project the students can develop the communication skills the most
SI114J-00210-P50022 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) attending a lecture attending a lectures are more effective than reading alone
SI114J-00210-P50023 1 SI114J-00210 0.00 7.09 <o,Q5,C,P5> universities have have a lot of modern learning facilities
SI114J-00210-P50023 1 SI114J-00210 7.09 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it is very important for university to provide them

SI114J-00214-P10005 1 SI114J-00214 16.41 19.02 <o,Q5,C,P1> but not into environmental thing
SI114J-00214-P10005 1 SI114J-00214 19.02 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> but i know that
SI114J-00214-P10006 1 SI114J-00214 0.00 6.72 <o,Q5,C,P1> me and my friend (%hesitation%) enjoying most of the time (%hesitation%) eating
SI114J-00214-P10006 1 SI114J-00214 6.72 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> first we cooked our favourite meals and then we love to talk which (%hesitation%) our day and cook from our favourite dishes and then afterwards going out for maybe some drinks
SI114J-00214-P10007 1 SI114J-00214 0.00 15.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i think the most similar to me from my siblings is my younger brother because he is very (%hesitation%) hard working (%hesitation%) and also (s-) he's studying much
SI114J-00214-P10007 1 SI114J-00214 15.60 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> he is always giving time for his studies

SI114J-00214-P30017 1 SI114J-00214 8.16 34.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantages of (%hesitation%) having fitness classes are it might get (%hesitation%) your body the students will get (%hesitation%) used to to the routine that they can able to be flexible before they are going to the class and they also have to know how how the fitness fitness class works not just for not just only learning
SI114J-00214-P30017 1 SI114J-00214 34.98 50.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) the disadvantage can be that for for the other students will be pairing or maybe some some some of them will not like it because (%hesitation%) they are already stressed with the school stuffs and so on
SI114J-00214-P30017 1 SI114J-00214 50.36 55.35 <o,Q5,C,P3> the opinion regarding this fitness class is i don't think it's truly necessary to have (%hesitation%) fitness classes
SI114J-00214-P30017 1 SI114J-00214 55.35 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> maybe some kind of (%hesitation%) training like you know some doing doing some sports but not

SI114J-00214-P50023 1 SI114J-00214 2.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah some of those students become more independent when they get to live abroad when they can only focus onto onto themselves that they have to be so independent or focus to their studies that they are only allowed
SI114J-00216-P10005 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 6.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> to be honest i'm not really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00216-P10005 1 SI114J-00216 6.96 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really interested in my country
SI114J-00216-P10006 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> during my free time i like watching tv series movies and anime
SI114J-00216-P10007 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> for find me i think reading english articles and and reading novels is really useful for me because i want to expand my expressions and vocabulary
SI114J-00216-P10008 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) well i think i i want to learn programming skill because i think it's really useful in the future
SI114J-00216-P30017 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 16.86 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think one of the advantages of doing part time jobs is that you can experience job and you can prepare for the future
SI114J-00216-P30017 1 SI114J-00216 16.86 32.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> in the other hand the one of the disadvantage is (%hesitation%) you have to (%hesitation%) you have to decrease your study time
SI114J-00216-P30017 1 SI114J-00216 32.72 38.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> so maybe your degree (%hesitation%) i mean the your grade will decrease
SI114J-00216-P30017 1 SI114J-00216 38.61 47.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my opinion i think it's really nice way to for the preparing for the future
SI114J-00216-P30017 1 SI114J-00216 47.70 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> if you if you have time doing part time jobs are really nice
SI114J-00216-P40018 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 10.29 <o,Q5,C,P4> there is (%hesitation%) a diagram and it shows how pollution causes acid rain
SI114J-00216-P40018 1 SI114J-00216 10.29 23.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> at first factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) make pollution and then the pollution become acid particles
SI114J-00216-P40018 1 SI114J-00216 23.95 35.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it will be in the (%hesitation%) it would become in smoke and those pollutions are in the smoke
SI114J-00216-P40018 1 SI114J-00216 35.56 55.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> next the (ac-) the acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust but (%hesitation%) other acid particles mix with water and then the acid particle are in the rain or snow
SI114J-00216-P40018 1 SI114J-00216 55.36 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> then the those wind (%hesitation%) those rain will damage to
SI114J-00216-P50019 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 5.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i will give an advice for you
SI114J-00216-P50019 1 SI114J-00216 5.22 10.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you should eat (w-) eat vegetables and meats
SI114J-00216-P50019 1 SI114J-00216 10.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to think about the balance not only eating meat or not only eating vegetables
SI114J-00216-P50020 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 5.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think drinking water lots of water is really important
SI114J-00216-P50020 1 SI114J-00216 5.24 10.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because everybody is (%hesitation%) made of
SI114J-00216-P50020 1 SI114J-00216 10.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i heard that seventy percent of human body is made of water
SI114J-00216-P50021 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 4.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think doing exercise every day is important
SI114J-00216-P50021 1 SI114J-00216 4.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) if you feel tired or you don't feel really good then then you don't have to do that exercise every day
SI114J-00216-P50022 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 12.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think sleep eight hours are is really (im-) important and i want to do that but sometimes it's really difficult to sleep eight hours
SI114J-00216-P50022 1 SI114J-00216 12.98 14.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't have time
SI114J-00216-P50022 1 SI114J-00216 14.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you if you can then you sleep more time
SI114J-00216-P50023 1 SI114J-00216 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology brings (%hesitation%) many many pros and cons but i (%hesitation%) generally speaking i think technology is really nice for nice
SI114J-00217-P10005 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> learning about other countries yes because i assess it we can broaden our horizons open up new opportunities and even most important thing we can develop a strong professional career thanks to the languages
SI114J-00217-P10006 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 9.59 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm crazy about going out with friends for having some beverages (f-) beers and even cookies
SI114J-00217-P10006 1 SI114J-00217 9.59 12.85 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i were you i would definitely join us
SI114J-00217-P10006 1 SI114J-00217 12.85 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it is said that my friends are the best in the world and i'm totally crazy about them
SI114J-00217-P10007 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 12.82 <o,Q5,C,P1> the best way would be just travelling around the world to get to know new (t-) cultures new people and new lifestyles
SI114J-00217-P10007 1 SI114J-00217 12.82 18.18 <o,Q5,C,P1> this without any kind of doubt will help you develop a professional career
SI114J-00217-P10007 1 SI114J-00217 18.18 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and it is recommended for
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 18.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> (en-) entirely convinced that working while we are student is a good option to develop a professional career easily even to broaden our horizons and why not to make progress in our lives
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 18.30 24.40 <o,Q5,C,P3> of course we'll have more opportunities to go into the workplace and easy indeed
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 24.40 35.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main disadvantages the main drawbacks indeed are perhaps that we don't have enough time for having very good qualifications perhaps
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 35.28 42.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> if i were you the best option would be just have a reasonable work study balance
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 42.50 50.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> that would help indeed to develop some skills some competencies that perhaps are highly useful to develop in the future
SI114J-00217-P30017 1 SI114J-00217 50.91 58.97 <o,Q5,C,P3> it is says it is said that a good combination of study and work make you the best professional ever

SI114J-00217-P40018 1 SI114J-00217 5.71 14.82 <o,Q5,C,P4> i will explaining the process and the steps for generating this acid rain that perhaps we are highly recommended
SI114J-00217-P40018 1 SI114J-00217 14.82 24.82 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all of course the vehicles the factories and even our c o two are going directly to the sky to the environment
SI114J-00217-P40018 1 SI114J-00217 24.82 31.40 <o,Q5,C,P4> this creates of course pollution and some excess particles which are directly in a smoke

SI114J-00217-P40018 1 SI114J-00217 47.81 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is said that if these particle go to the environment they'll have the chance to damage in a very important way the environment so we should be very aware of the need not to create that
SI114J-00217-P50019 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 7.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> would be highly recommended just to eat vegetables lettuces
SI114J-00217-P50019 1 SI114J-00217 7.84 16.70 <o,Q5,C,P5> but perhaps the most important thing would be just doing exercise some weightlifting or even in a spa facility room
SI114J-00217-P50019 1 SI114J-00217 16.70 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> that will be the best fitter and sporty (per-)

SI114J-00217-P50021 1 SI114J-00217 14.14 19.36 <o,Q5,C,P5> indeed i would advise everyone to develop some liftweighting every day

SI114J-00217-P50023 1 SI114J-00217 0.00 8.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> from my point of view of course technology is one essential part in our lives

SI114J-00219-P30017 1 SI114J-00219 33.86 52.05 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but (f-) fortunately in my opinion i still think that university students should do that part time jobs because it is the best way for students to rich rich their life or to rich their school life
SI114J-00219-P30017 1 SI114J-00219 52.05 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> or on the other hand this part time job rich their life experience
SI114J-00219-P50019 1 SI114J-00219 0.00 8.26 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i would suggest people to eat more vegetations because eating more vegetation is the best way for people to keep healthy
SI114J-00219-P50019 1 SI114J-00219 8.26 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and it can help people to (l-) to shed their fat or other such as calories
SI114J-00219-P50020 1 SI114J-00219 0.00 12.84 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think drink a lot of water can help people to compensate their losing of liquid because the liquid is very important for people life

SI114J-00219-P50021 1 SI114J-00219 0.00 11.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) yes it is it is very essential to do exercise every day because doing exercise every day can help people to keep healthy

SI114J-00219-P50022 1 SI114J-00219 13.78 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so in all i think sleeping eight hours every day is not a good idea for me
SI114J-00219-P50023 1 SI114J-00219 0.00 7.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion i think technology have has many negative influence on

SI114J-00223-P10007 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 6.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) as i said (%hesitation%) i love rihanna it's my favourite singer
SI114J-00223-P10007 1 SI114J-00223 6.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so the most person i i want to know is is her because i think is a interesting people
SI114J-00223-P10008 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in the next years i become a doctor so if (%hesitation%) patients from other country comes to the hospital i will be able to treat (%hesitation%) him or her
SI114J-00223-P30017 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 30.62 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the main advantages the main advantages of (%hesitation%) studying a foreign language (%hesitation%) in the university at the university (%hesitation%) is that student have the possibility (%hesitation%) to travel (%hesitation%) to another country a different country and make new friends and (%hesitation%) know different cultures
SI114J-00223-P30017 1 SI114J-00223 30.62 48.15 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the main disadvantages is that if the university don't doesn't offer this course of foreign language (%hesitation%) sometimes some students (%hesitation%) can't afford these courses
SI114J-00223-P30017 1 SI114J-00223 48.15 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion it's (ne-) it's nessary it's necessary (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) take these courses of foreign language but i think it should be obligash
SI114J-00223-P50019 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to find out about international news is (%hesitation%) through internet because (%hesitation%) you only have to search something and immediately you can obtain the answer
SI114J-00223-P50020 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 9.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that (%hesitation%) at least the newspapers on paper (%hesitation%) because i think the future is the technology
SI114J-00223-P50020 1 SI114J-00223 9.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you'll be able you will be able to look something (%hesitation%) on the internet and and
SI114J-00223-P50021 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 14.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> from my point of view i don't think that social media is a good way to (%hesitation%) find out about news because (%hesitation%) there are a lot of (%hesitation%) fake news
SI114J-00223-P50021 1 SI114J-00223 14.58 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so maybe you'll be wrong about something for reading in this in this
SI114J-00223-P50022 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's very important because (%hesitation%) the local news have a influence (%hesitation%) in your lifetime in your life and i think (%hesitation%) we must be aware of what is happening in the world
SI114J-00223-P50023 1 SI114J-00223 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i agree with that people because i think (%hesitation%) they the maybe (%hesitation%) the media (%hesitation%) always tend to (%hesitation%) to to look look in the bad news (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00229-P10005 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i'm living tokyo the centre city of japan and it is a very good place because it's very convenient in every aspect of life

SI114J-00229-P10007 1 SI114J-00229 13.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> he is fifteen years old and i love him so much
SI114J-00229-P10008 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 8.46 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if possible i would like to be a painter or illustrator

SI114J-00229-P30017 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 16.07 <o,Q5,B1,P3> well the advantages may be they can get broaden their (%hesitation%) experience for the actual job
SI114J-00229-P30017 1 SI114J-00229 16.07 26.60 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but on the other hand (%hesitation%) this definitely lessen their time for (%hesitation%) studying their major
SI114J-00229-P30017 1 SI114J-00229 26.60 46.73 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion it is definitely not good thing because (%hesitation%) the principal job for student is to deepen their language (%hesitation%) deepen their (%hesitation%) knowledge for their subject
SI114J-00229-P30017 1 SI114J-00229 46.73 49.26 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so i don't think

SI114J-00229-P40018 1 SI114J-00229 8.95 18.79 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well we need to go to airplane by using a transportation method
SI114J-00229-P40018 1 SI114J-00229 18.79 34.92 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then after arrivng at airport we need to check in and (%hesitation%) the person in charge will take care of your document control
SI114J-00229-P40018 1 SI114J-00229 34.92 44.15 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then (%hesitation%) you need to we need to go through security checker
SI114J-00229-P40018 1 SI114J-00229 44.15 55.42 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and after finishing these two process we just wait at the airport
SI114J-00229-P40018 1 SI114J-00229 55.42 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and when the time come we
SI114J-00229-P50019 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 11.98 <o,Q3,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion there are a lot of (%hesitation%) (numer-) numerous softwares for their p cs
SI114J-00229-P50019 1 SI114J-00229 11.98 20.04 <o,Q3,B1,P5> and if they use it effectively they can manage their time schedule or researches
SI114J-00229-P50021 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 20.04 <o,Q3,B1,P5> well there're many thing (%hesitation%) they can earn learn (%hesitation%) by group projects such as by sharing opinions they can develop human skills as well as communication
SI114J-00229-P50022 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 5.88 <o,Q3,B1,P5> i think books are important
SI114J-00229-P50022 1 SI114J-00229 5.88 11.49 <o,Q3,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) by attending lectures you can learn (%hesitation%) many things
SI114J-00229-P50022 1 SI114J-00229 11.49 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> and also (%hesitation%) learning by yourself by reading you can get (sir-)
SI114J-00229-P50023 1 SI114J-00229 0.00 3.08 <o,Q3,B1,P5> is very important
SI114J-00229-P50023 1 SI114J-00229 3.08 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) by providing such (%hesitation%) latest learning facilities (%hesitation%) students can learn (%hesitation%) more more than (%hesitation%) cutting edge (%hesitation%) (sk-)
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 6.54 <o,Q5,C,P4> the process by which the honey of the supermarket is produced is far from easy
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 6.54 12.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> in fact everything starts when bees collect nectar from the flowers in the fields
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 12.68 18.48 <o,Q5,C,P4> the bees release this nectar in the beehive and then produce the honey
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 18.48 29.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> this honey is collected by beekeepers which (%hesitation%) usually wear some special dresses to protect themselves from the bites of the bees
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 29.32 48.15 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) later on this honey is introduced in some type of jars and these jars with the honey inside are all together sterilisised in order to reduce the bacterial that is inside the bee the the honey
SI114J-00230-P40018 1 SI114J-00230 48.15 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> finally (%hesitation%) these jars with the honey are sended to the supermarket
SI114J-00230-P50019 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 12.09 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i think the main aspects to consider are related to the health system of that country and also the security in the streets
SI114J-00230-P50019 1 SI114J-00230 12.09 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) one of the many important aspects too is that of the university that you want to go
SI114J-00230-P50020 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 13.05 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that studying a second language is always very useful for life especially if the language (%hesitation%) that is native to you it's not very widely spread
SI114J-00230-P50020 1 SI114J-00230 13.05 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so you will take advantage of learning a second language which could be more international such as english or spanish
SI114J-00230-P50021 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 9.66 <o,Q4,C,P5> well in my point of view the overcoming the language barrier is usually the most difficult aspect of studying in another country
SI114J-00230-P50021 1 SI114J-00230 9.66 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> because no matter how hard you've been studying the language or for how long probably once there (%hesitation%) you will find problems with a local (acc-)
SI114J-00230-P50022 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 10.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i think that when you studying abroad the main (%hesitation%) way to learn about local culture is that of mixing with local people
SI114J-00230-P50022 1 SI114J-00230 10.60 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> live with theirs go out with theirs (%hesitation%) stay with their families and try to learn this little unspoken agreements
SI114J-00230-P50023 1 SI114J-00230 0.00 16.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i have no doubt that (%hesitation%) living abroad (%hesitation%) helps you to become more independent especially because you will face a lot of (%hesitation%) different and difficult situations that you will have to deal with and without the help of your parents
SI114J-00230-P50023 1 SI114J-00230 16.36 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and you will become more independent for sure
SI114J-00235-P10005 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i prefer summer due to the fact that i am holidays so i can spend my free time with my friends and my family
SI114J-00235-P10006 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 5.36 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i try to read the news every day on twitter
SI114J-00235-P10006 1 SI114J-00235 5.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but it's true that i don't watch the tv because they are always speaking about coronavirus and politics
SI114J-00235-P10007 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 7.40 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i was always playing football with my friends in my school's playground
SI114J-00235-P10007 1 SI114J-00235 7.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and on weekends i used to go to my village with my parents and my sister
SI114J-00235-P10008 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like to continue working as a p e teacher and being able to enjoy my free time with my family and my friends travelling abroad
SI114J-00235-P30017 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 13.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> nowadays (%hesitation%) practical work experience is really important for most companies (%hesitation%) since they always ask for experience in available positions
SI114J-00235-P30017 1 SI114J-00235 13.65 27.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it is why introducing the it in university programs can have several advantages such as the chance to get a reputation in the sector
SI114J-00235-P30017 1 SI114J-00235 27.06 42.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand (%hesitation%) regarding disadvantages the only one if they have is that students will have less free time (%hesitation%) in an already stressful time
SI114J-00235-P30017 1 SI114J-00235 42.32 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> to finish up in my own opinion (%hesitation%) i totally agree with the statement that (%hesitation%) practical work experience is very important because in my opinion it's the best
SI114J-00235-P40018 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 7.64 <o,Q3,B2,P4> this line graph shows the total number of visitors to the three new online pop music sites
SI114J-00235-P40018 1 SI114J-00235 7.64 40.77 <o,Q3,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) overall (%hesitation%) the most successful (%hesitation%) has been tunes net (%hesitation%) since as well as (%hesitation%) songs four you they started (%hesitation%) from the bottom but tunes net managed to finish the week on the top with (%hesitation%) one hundred thousand visitors whereas (%hesitation%) songs four you (%hesitation%) dropped suddenly to twenty thousand
SI114J-00235-P40018 1 SI114J-00235 40.77 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) to finish up (%hesitation%) music now (%hesitation%) rose steadily (%hesitation%) in the beginning of the week but they declined significantly on saturday and sunday
SI114J-00235-P50019 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> from my point of view a person with good social skills is needed for this position since he has to earn some respect from his team
SI114J-00235-P50020 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> you want to have (%hesitation%) a wide range range of opinions which will limit your ability to solve certain problems
SI114J-00235-P50021 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 1.85 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't think so
SI114J-00235-P50021 1 SI114J-00235 1.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i mean if it is a good idea everyone can agree and if not (%hesitation%) it's great to have differents points of view
SI114J-00235-P50022 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 2.34 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i definitely agree
SI114J-00235-P50022 1 SI114J-00235 2.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) seems the best way to share opinions is while sitting in the same room with all the other members of your team
SI114J-00235-P50023 1 SI114J-00235 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree completely because as i said before in my opinion the more opinions you have the better for the team
SI114J-00236-P10005 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 3.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (terested-) in music so much
SI114J-00236-P10005 1 SI114J-00236 3.72 13.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) actually i have a application the called is the called (%hesitation%) spotify in my phone
SI114J-00236-P10005 1 SI114J-00236 13.88 18.39 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i every day i listen music
SI114J-00236-P10005 1 SI114J-00236 18.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> especially i like (j-)

SI114J-00236-P10006 1 SI114J-00236 9.06 17.50 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for example last year last spring i went to thailand and i practice waterski there

SI114J-00236-P10007 1 SI114J-00236 4.78 9.80 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think he was (%hesitation%) best baseball player in the world
SI114J-00236-P10007 1 SI114J-00236 9.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and he if i can meet him i wanna play catch and watch his (laso-)
SI114J-00236-P10008 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 6.69 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think speaking english helps me to travel abroad
SI114J-00236-P10008 1 SI114J-00236 6.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for example i (%hesitation%) no i like i love to travel abroad so i can go anywhere everywhere and make friend
SI114J-00236-P30017 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 12.76 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think all students i think all students should not study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI114J-00236-P30017 1 SI114J-00236 12.76 27.58 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if they have (%hesitation%) have this class (%hesitation%) some students can be more speak as can speak foreign language more in fluency
SI114J-00236-P30017 1 SI114J-00236 27.58 44.36 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but i think this (i-) but i i (%hesitation%) disagree this idea because i have an the big disadvantage in this case
SI114J-00236-P30017 1 SI114J-00236 44.36 56.38 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for (%hesitation%) this is the they can not enough time to study the other thing or mother tongue
SI114J-00236-P30017 1 SI114J-00236 56.38 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i don't think choose
SI114J-00236-P50019 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 10.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the best way to know the international news is watching on the tv
SI114J-00236-P50019 1 SI114J-00236 10.38 18.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are many tv show about the international news in japan for example n h k
SI114J-00236-P50019 1 SI114J-00236 18.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should
SI114J-00236-P50020 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 14.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree this idea (becau-) opinion because recently in the case of japan the government's ask us no more paper
SI114J-00236-P50020 1 SI114J-00236 14.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes so there will there is (%hesitation%) there's
SI114J-00236-P50021 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 14.47 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the social media is not reliable because we can change the contents of social media very easy
SI114J-00236-P50021 1 SI114J-00236 14.47 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this content is not
SI114J-00236-P50022 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 14.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think very it is very important to keep up the of the local news because news protect local news protect us from the danger
SI114J-00236-P50022 1 SI114J-00236 14.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in the case of covid nineteen we have to know the present
SI114J-00236-P50023 1 SI114J-00236 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i also think there are too much bad news
SI114J-00236-P50023 1 SI114J-00236 4.34 16.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example these days every tv show tell us the contents of covi nineteen
SI114J-00236-P50023 1 SI114J-00236 16.73 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> when i saw that i was
SI114J-00242-P10005 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 3.43 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very interested in the (en-) environment
SI114J-00242-P10005 1 SI114J-00242 3.43 17.52 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think that it's very important to take care about the (enviro-) environment because (%hesitation%) if (y-) we don't (%hesitation%) look after it we in the future (w-) the world will finish
SI114J-00242-P10005 1 SI114J-00242 17.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and it's (%hesitation%) very
SI114J-00242-P10006 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 7.02 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy doing with my friends (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) going to the beach because i love go to the beach
SI114J-00242-P10006 1 SI114J-00242 7.02 12.92 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and when i go to the beach when we go to the beach sorry we eat paella and we love it
SI114J-00242-P10006 1 SI114J-00242 12.92 16.52 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so the best plan is go to the beach
SI114J-00242-P10006 1 SI114J-00242 16.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but also we love going to the (ci-)

SI114J-00242-P10008 1 SI114J-00242 13.22 17.59 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i think it's a very wonderful place
SI114J-00242-P10008 1 SI114J-00242 17.59 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so i will spend

SI114J-00242-P30017 1 SI114J-00242 6.99 26.01 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's a best way to to to improve the they the health of of of the of the of the schools of the people because if if we have a obligation to (%hesitation%) to do fitness classes we we will do it
SI114J-00242-P30017 1 SI114J-00242 26.01 31.61 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it's a good way to to to improve our our health
SI114J-00242-P30017 1 SI114J-00242 31.61 51.77 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) there are many advantages of of this of this (%hesitation%) question because if you because (%hesitation%) when you do fitness classes you feel better with with your body and you you will you will (%hesitation%) you you will be healthy
SI114J-00242-P30017 1 SI114J-00242 51.77 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion is there is a very good idea do this type of of (fi-)

SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 9.18 16.62 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when when the nectar is collected bees make honey from nectar in (beehi-) in beehives
SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 16.62 22.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) then (%hesitation%) the beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 22.70 34.74 <o,Q4,B1,P4> they wear they wear (%hesitation%) some clothes to protect to protect him because (%hesitation%) because the the bees can be very dangerous
SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 34.74 37.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so when the beekeepers
SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 37.34 47.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) when the honey is collected by beekeepers (%hesitation%) they they we have to put it in a in a in a recipient
SI114J-00242-P40018 1 SI114J-00242 47.59 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) later (%hesitation%) they they they we they later they they went to the to the to the shop
SI114J-00242-P50019 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 10.83 <o,Q5,B1,P5> when the students a country to study in they have to consider that (%hesitation%) they they they have to be comfortable in the in this country
SI114J-00242-P50019 1 SI114J-00242 10.83 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so (%hesitation%) it it have to be (%hesitation%) a beautiful place where where people can
SI114J-00242-P50020 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 10.68 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the studying in a second language is very useful because if you have (%hesitation%) another language to talk about (%hesitation%) you will improve your skills
SI114J-00242-P50020 1 SI114J-00242 10.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so if you want you wants to travel to another country and and you speak (wi-) this and in the country speaks this second language you will
SI114J-00242-P50021 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 10.70 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that the students (%hesitation%) have the difficulty to (%hesitation%) to meet other different persons other different people sorry
SI114J-00242-P50021 1 SI114J-00242 10.70 18.18 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and there in the in in other country they (%hesitation%) the people don't have the usual
SI114J-00242-P50021 1 SI114J-00242 18.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> there is there is family
SI114J-00242-P50022 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 12.67 <o,Q4,B1,P5> they can learn many things about local culture because when you are living in another country you can visit (%hesitation%) the the different places that are in there in there
SI114J-00242-P50022 1 SI114J-00242 12.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so it's a very good idea to to learn local country going out (%hesitation%) in another country
SI114J-00242-P50023 1 SI114J-00242 0.00 15.36 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree because if you are in another country and there there are you haven't your family and your and your friends you have to you have to learn how to be (%hesitation%) independent
SI114J-00242-P50023 1 SI114J-00242 15.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so (%hesitation%) it's it's like an (oblig-) eobligation
SI114J-00251-P10005 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 5.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> my favourite time (%hesitation%) is of course winter because it has christmas
SI114J-00251-P10005 1 SI114J-00251 5.97 11.14 <o,Q4,C,P1> this is when when all the family we all meet up and see each other
SI114J-00251-P10005 1 SI114J-00251 11.14 15.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> probably the only time of the year that we are all together having dinner
SI114J-00251-P10005 1 SI114J-00251 15.68 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i wish we could come back as before because
SI114J-00251-P10006 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 8.52 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think it's really important to get involved in what is happening in the rest of the world specially in your community (%hesitation%) to be part of it
SI114J-00251-P10006 1 SI114J-00251 8.52 14.24 <o,Q4,C,P1> so nowadays of course we have to be really careful with the fake news in social media
SI114J-00251-P10006 1 SI114J-00251 14.24 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i wish we could get (%hesitation%) all the news that were
SI114J-00251-P10007 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 3.46 <o,Q4,C,P1> i used to spend my free time (%hesitation%) drawing
SI114J-00251-P10007 1 SI114J-00251 3.46 10.52 <o,Q4,C,P1> i know there was drawing all the time specially in a patio that we have outside (%hesitation%) my place
SI114J-00251-P10007 1 SI114J-00251 10.52 12.74 <o,Q4,C,P1> and so when
SI114J-00251-P10007 1 SI114J-00251 12.74 19.36 <o,Q4,C,P1> and now i keep all the drawings and i thought i was doing it well but apparently i wasn't so good
SI114J-00251-P10007 1 SI114J-00251 19.36 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (s-)
SI114J-00251-P10008 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 4.87 <o,Q4,C,P1> i wish i i were a biology teacher (ni-) right now
SI114J-00251-P10008 1 SI114J-00251 4.87 13.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> and if i had studied harder in my university i would have become (%hesitation%) a teacher right now
SI114J-00251-P10008 1 SI114J-00251 13.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but because i didn't so now i have to study a little bit more for two years i guess
SI114J-00251-P30017 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 5.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> i wish i could have that kind of experience before i finish my university courses

SI114J-00251-P30017 1 SI114J-00251 26.84 42.17 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) one of the main disadvantages is that maybe (%hesitation%) if you reduced (%hesitation%) the time for studying you could get a lot of stress (%hesitation%) for the final exams for example
SI114J-00251-P30017 1 SI114J-00251 42.17 51.09 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also they might take advantage of your work and you are doing it for free so you may lose motivation for the rest of the courses
SI114J-00251-P30017 1 SI114J-00251 51.09 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> anyway my opinion (%hesitation%) weighting ups and downs i think it's really good
SI114J-00251-P40018 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 15.02 <o,Q4,C,P4> regarding the graphic that i have in front of me (%hesitation%) i really think tunes net (%hesitation%) is the one that has experienced (%hesitation%) the highest increase in in the thousands of people that had visited the place
SI114J-00251-P40018 1 SI114J-00251 15.02 26.43 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) these has gone from twenty thousand people to almost one hundred thousand people which is an amazing (%hesitation%) increased
SI114J-00251-P40018 1 SI114J-00251 26.43 50.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) the other two like music now for example it started in a higher level already (%hesitation%) whereas the song for you (%hesitation%) had around fifty thousand of people (%hesitation%) visiting the place (%hesitation%) although this last one had (%hesitation%) a drop in in the number of visits while the music now had increase a little bit
SI114J-00251-P40018 1 SI114J-00251 50.34 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> but in the end it's around eighty thousand thousands of people (the-)
SI114J-00251-P50019 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think a good team leader is known to have like strong character patient patience and a lot of (%hesitation%) creative (%hesitation%) ideas in order to be able to deal with the rest of the group and being able to to get along
SI114J-00251-P50020 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 11.42 <o,Q5,C,P5> sometimes getting along with a lot of people is easier than getting along with just two or three people which you may not like and you have to be able to work with them
SI114J-00251-P50020 1 SI114J-00251 11.42 13.31 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) you don't have any other choices
SI114J-00251-P50020 1 SI114J-00251 13.31 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so you may have to work harder in order to be able to understand them and to
SI114J-00251-P50021 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 12.15 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course but only if you do it with lots of respect and because i really think when you disagree you are open to new ideas and not only what for example the team leader would say
SI114J-00251-P50021 1 SI114J-00251 12.15 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) like this you will have lots of options and lots of different (%hesitation%) problem
SI114J-00251-P50022 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 12.82 <o,Q5,C,P5> i wish we could all work face to face but due to the pandemic (%hesitation%) we saw that this is not a really (%hesitation%) easy subject right now
SI114J-00251-P50022 1 SI114J-00251 12.82 17.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) of course you can do it on your laptop (%hesitation%) through a screen
SI114J-00251-P50022 1 SI114J-00251 17.45 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think it's better face to face
SI114J-00251-P50023 1 SI114J-00251 0.00 11.87 <o,Q5,C,P5> well of course you will have many different points of views whereas if you work alone you will only work on your (%hesitation%) point of view and you will find only a solution
SI114J-00251-P50023 1 SI114J-00251 11.87 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> whereas if you work in a in a group (%hesitation%) many people have (%hesitation%) different ways
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 1.17 <o,Q4,C,P1> sure
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 1.17 2.25 <o,Q4,C,P1> no problem at all
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 2.25 5.01 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it's a really green area with lots of parks
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 5.01 8.04 <o,Q4,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) to be honest i'd say it's a residential area
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 8.04 13.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 13.68 16.93 <o,Q4,C,P1> so (%hesitation%) yeah i think it's in a way kind of fancy
SI114J-00254-P10005 1 SI114J-00254 16.93 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but i would i wouldn't say that
SI114J-00254-P10006 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 4.62 <o,Q4,C,P1> i enjoy doing the same thing that i enjoy to do (an-) any other day
SI114J-00254-P10006 1 SI114J-00254 4.62 8.40 <o,Q4,C,P1> but i think that the feeling of being on holiday just make things different
SI114J-00254-P10006 1 SI114J-00254 8.40 14.88 <o,Q4,C,P1> i just want to spend time with my friends playing video games doing sports going to the beach or going to the swimming pool
SI114J-00254-P10006 1 SI114J-00254 14.88 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> you know there's lots of activities that i love to do (%hesitation%) on summer
SI114J-00254-P10007 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 3.96 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) first i would say my brother
SI114J-00254-P10007 1 SI114J-00254 3.96 10.82 <o,Q4,C,P1> but i i have to say that that overall is my mother just because (%hesitation%) we understand each other so well
SI114J-00254-P10007 1 SI114J-00254 10.82 13.27 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i think that our personalities are much alike
SI114J-00254-P10007 1 SI114J-00254 13.27 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i'd say that (%hesitation%) we understand each other on an emotional level pretty damn (we-)
SI114J-00254-P10008 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 2.82 <o,Q4,C,P1> specifically i don't mind
SI114J-00254-P10008 1 SI114J-00254 2.82 5.50 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i don't hope for a specific type of job
SI114J-00254-P10008 1 SI114J-00254 5.50 14.51 <o,Q4,C,P1> i just want it to be (%hesitation%) fulfilling and then to be something that i really have a lot of illusion (%hesitation%) going to
SI114J-00254-P10008 1 SI114J-00254 14.51 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> you know when i wake up in the morning i have a lot of (%hesitation%) of illusion going to work
SI114J-00254-P30017 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 23.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think some of the the advantages that students get from (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) getting jobs (%hesitation%) to pay for their university studies are that (n-) especially obviously they get paid and they attain a lot of a valuable experience that afterwards (%hesitation%) might (u-) prove useful when trying to find a work (%hesitation%) a job excuse me
SI114J-00254-P30017 1 SI114J-00254 23.25 41.84 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand however i think that some of the disvantage is that you spend most of your free time (%hesitation%) working although you could spend it partying (s-) hanging out with your friends with your family (%hesitation%) knowing some different cities around your home or (%hesitation%) you know having some free time with your girlfriend
SI114J-00254-P30017 1 SI114J-00254 41.84 48.36 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think those are really special times that you need to to (%hesitation%) to take care of
SI114J-00254-P30017 1 SI114J-00254 48.36 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> my opinion is that if the job (%hesitation%) gives you and offers you (%hesitation%) professional experience you should do it
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 7.78 <o,Q4,C,P4> travelling by airplane can sometimes be a little bit tedious (%hesitation%) to some people
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 7.78 11.83 <o,Q4,C,P4> it all starts with (%hesitation%) arriving to the airport of course
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 11.83 28.26 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) to be honest i usually tend and i think its usually recommended that people arrive to the airport at least two hours (earl-) earlier than the (%hesitation%) the the flight is supposed to to depart just in case any any complications appear
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 28.26 34.72 <o,Q4,C,P4> well once you get there you you have to do the your check in and be careful with your with your luggage
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 34.72 38.28 <o,Q4,C,P4> afterwards so you have to pass the security and document control
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 38.28 42.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> and after that point i think that all all you have to do next is wait
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 42.95 50.36 <o,Q4,C,P4> just wait and be near your boarding gate (%hesitation%) until ten minutes earl before the boarding gate (%hesitation%) opens
SI114J-00254-P40018 1 SI114J-00254 50.36 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you board it's just everything done
SI114J-00254-P50019 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 10.41 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think they can use the internet (%hesitation%) that provides them with a a whole (s-) new set of available manners to to learn
SI114J-00254-P50019 1 SI114J-00254 10.41 11.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think i think that's vital
SI114J-00254-P50019 1 SI114J-00254 11.63 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think if you use correctly both your mobile phone and your p c or your computer you can attain so much knowledge in a
SI114J-00254-P50020 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 14.59 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion i prefer face to face learning just because if you connect with your teacher you can (%hesitation%) you develop a whole nother level of concentration and dedication to that subject
SI114J-00254-P50020 1 SI114J-00254 14.59 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i think that in the end it pays off and you get a lot of knowledge out of it
SI114J-00254-P50021 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,C,P5> knowing how to cope with different types of personalities knowing how to teamwork efficiently i think there's a lot to be learn and gain from (%hesitation%) group projects
SI114J-00254-P50021 1 SI114J-00254 10.52 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i have to be honest i i always hate them but (%hesitation%) in the end there's a lot to be to be used from it
SI114J-00254-P50022 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 3.35 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it depends on the (su-) on on the subject of course
SI114J-00254-P50022 1 SI114J-00254 3.35 10.20 <o,Q4,C,P5> like for example engineering subjects if you don't attend to your lectures you're pretty much done
SI114J-00254-P50022 1 SI114J-00254 10.20 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) but for example if you're studying's history and (%hesitation%) you don't connect with your teacher studying and reading it alone is not a big deal
SI114J-00254-P50023 1 SI114J-00254 0.00 1.54 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's vital
SI114J-00254-P50023 1 SI114J-00254 1.54 9.93 <o,Q4,C,P5> if you provide the students (%hesitation%) tools to (%hesitation%) elevate their learning process to another level i think it's invaluable for them
SI114J-00254-P50023 1 SI114J-00254 9.93 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but you know as always (%hesitation%) institutions and and specifically (uni-) (%hesitation%) public universities they don't have that kind of material
SI114J-00268-P10005 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 5.40 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the place where i sleep is such a nice and wonderful place
SI114J-00268-P10005 1 SI114J-00268 5.40 9.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there are a lot of restaurant by the sea
SI114J-00268-P10005 1 SI114J-00268 9.43 14.76 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there are so many options to do regarding your social life
SI114J-00268-P10005 1 SI114J-00268 14.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> you have the chance to go to the museum or having a beer
SI114J-00268-P10006 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 6.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> being on holiday is the thing i enjoy the most is travelling
SI114J-00268-P10006 1 SI114J-00268 6.00 14.76 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'd say it helps me to (%hesitation%) quit routine to enjoy myself
SI114J-00268-P10006 1 SI114J-00268 14.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i i am usually able to get to know new
SI114J-00268-P10007 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love spending time with my twin brother
SI114J-00268-P10007 1 SI114J-00268 4.88 15.38 <o,Q5,B2,P1> she is he is my twin brother and we usually understand each other without needing any word to be said
SI114J-00268-P10007 1 SI114J-00268 15.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we actually believe we shall be just one (pe-)
SI114J-00268-P10008 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 4.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i could i would be a teacher or a doctor
SI114J-00268-P10008 1 SI114J-00268 4.68 12.29 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would be anything which would help me to make an impact on society
SI114J-00268-P10008 1 SI114J-00268 12.29 18.55 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i consider being a doctor will be a great way of helping people
SI114J-00268-P10008 1 SI114J-00268 18.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (helpi-)
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 18.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> getting paid for university studies has great upside such as allowing the student to study at any university or any university career they may choose
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 18.43 25.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it is of course a chance of making yourself the best
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 25.17 37.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> however there are great disadvantage as well as it could be (%hesitation%) the problem of getting into debt
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 37.41 42.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i wouldn't obviously recommend having to owe any money
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 42.86 52.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion i would recommend nevertheless to to be paid for your university studies
SI114J-00268-P30017 1 SI114J-00268 52.78 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think everybody should have the the opportunity to choose whatever they want to do
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 8.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) this diagram illustrates the stage involved in the process of travelling by airplane
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 8.40 14.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it start with (%hesitation%) the travel to the airport where you will take your plane
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 14.41 23.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> there are so many means of transport that you could choose between the car the tram whatever
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 23.09 38.90 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once you get to the airport you will need to check your luggage in as well as you will have to show your document and all your package in the security line
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 38.90 46.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once they have cleared your passport you will have to wait until the boarding time
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 46.73 57.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> while you're waiting you have the chance to buy anything any gift or have any coffee going to the restroom and whatever
SI114J-00268-P40018 1 SI114J-00268 57.42 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after all you will get
SI114J-00268-P50019 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 15.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> from my point of view the best way to use technology for studying is to using (%hesitation%) technological devices such as laptop or tablet
SI114J-00268-P50019 1 SI114J-00268 15.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> those tools allow the student to enhance (th-)
SI114J-00268-P50020 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 3.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i can't to agree about that point
SI114J-00268-P50020 1 SI114J-00268 3.77 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would say that (%hesitation%) being face to face with a teacher (%hesitation%) helps you to increase your attention on the teacher
SI114J-00268-P50020 1 SI114J-00268 14.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it will also help you to make better question in order
SI114J-00268-P50021 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i wonder (%hesitation%) working group in group project will help the student to develop his communicative abilities along with (%hesitation%) his (%hesitation%) (evo-) evolving (%hesitation%) his communication with himself not only
SI114J-00268-P50022 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 8.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> as far as i'm concern i believe that attending lectures is far better than (con-) being alone
SI114J-00268-P50022 1 SI114J-00268 8.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider that lectures is a correct scenario to make the correct question as well as being able to access to
SI114J-00268-P50023 1 SI114J-00268 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the way i see things i would say that it is really really essential having modern facilities one for attending lectures but also for having the necessary technological devices in order to evolve the learning methodology
SI114J-00269-P10005 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 4.66 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i've woken quite lately (%hesitation%) in my life (%hesitation%) to music
SI114J-00269-P10005 1 SI114J-00269 4.66 15.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) very early in my life i wasn't so interested in music but now i i listen to a large (%hesitation%) range of music from rap to classical music
SI114J-00269-P10005 1 SI114J-00269 15.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i love to hear advice and recommendation from my friends
SI114J-00269-P10006 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 5.57 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it is i think it's one of my main passion actually (%hesitation%) traveling to other places

SI114J-00269-P10006 1 SI114J-00269 15.97 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i'm looking i'm really looking forward to go to vietnam
SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 6.66 <o,Q5,C,P1> the (p-) the most the famous person i mostly want to meet is barack obama i think
SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 6.66 9.89 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i think it's a very charismatic leader
SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 9.89 12.65 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) he has strong views on a lot of things
SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 12.65 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think he has the wisdom the wisdom to give me advice for my life my professional life and also personal (%hesitation%) life
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 9.99 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i think it will help me a lot (%hesitation%) mostly on in my professional life (%hesitation%) as i'm going to work in an international company
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269 9.99 15.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i will need to (sp-) communicate (%hesitation%) in english with all my colleagues (%hesitation%) throughout the world
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269 15.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and also personally it will help me a lot travelling (%hesitation%) i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> well of course i think it's extremely important to to learn a foreign language
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 4.88 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) first of all speaking two languages really open your minds i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 10.71 23.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> it opens your minds not only to a new language but also to a whole new culture because most of the time you don't only learn a new language you also learn about the the history of the country of the language you are learning
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 23.62 35.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example for it's if it's spain you're gonna learn about the america (%hesitation%) latin (%hesitation%) region also about the history of spain portugal et cetera
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 35.62 37.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's extremely important
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 37.47 40.01 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) and then i think it depends on where you're from
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 40.01 56.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> because if you are already from america (%hesitation%) or english and you are a native english speaker i think it's a little bit less important than for example if you're from a country and you don't speak english (%hesitation%) since english is the predominant language (%hesitation%) in our modern society
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 56.81 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think yeah it's you have to absolute get that if you don't
SI114J-00269-P50019 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the best way it is to actually follow a media in your country which already select (%hesitation%) select and collect (%hesitation%) and give you a summary of the news around the world

SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 3.06 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think we will lose the papers in the newspapers and i think it would be more technology driven digital driven
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 10.59 18.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think web platform will always exist (%hesitation%) from now on and yeah newspaper will just take a different form
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 18.27 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it will be more on the internet
SI114J-00269-P50021 1 SI114J-00269 0.00 4.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> most of the time yeah but that's the tricky thing with for example fake news
SI114J-00269-P50021 1 SI114J-00269 4.46 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's that you see generally ninety percent of (%hesitation%) actual facts and then there are ten percent where you have to cross sources (%hesitation%) make sure it's a reliable source et cetera

SI114J-00279-P40018 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 7.73 <o,Q4,B1,P4> factories and vehicles while working produce a pollution which is (%hesitation%) in the air
SI114J-00279-P40018 1 SI114J-00279 7.73 12.41 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this pollution contains acid particles which are carried by wind
SI114J-00279-P40018 1 SI114J-00279 12.41 20.30 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some of these particles fall as dust and meeting water such as rivers lakes and so on killing animals who live there
SI114J-00279-P40018 1 SI114J-00279 20.30 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> others mix with cloud water and falling in form of snow or rain creating (%hesitation%) the acid rain and then they damaging the environment
SI114J-00279-P50019 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 9.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that want to develop good eating habits i would say that (%hesitation%) they should cut off all junk food
SI114J-00279-P50019 1 SI114J-00279 9.71 13.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the start eating especially vegetables and fruits
SI114J-00279-P50019 1 SI114J-00279 13.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and then they should go to a doctor and (%hesitation%) to make a diet correct
SI114J-00279-P50020 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> important drink a lot of water such as two or three litres a day because water (%hesitation%) can give you energy
SI114J-00279-P50021 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 3.27 <o,Q4,B2,P5> very important doing exercise
SI114J-00279-P50021 1 SI114J-00279 3.27 6.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00279-P50021 1 SI114J-00279 6.80 15.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but of course (%hesitation%) you can do also exercise exercise for example running going out for a walk for about thirty minutes
SI114J-00279-P50021 1 SI114J-00279 15.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and stop
SI114J-00279-P50022 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 7.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> very important sleep about eight days every (ni-) eight hours every night
SI114J-00279-P50022 1 SI114J-00279 7.09 13.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) because i think that (%hesitation%) if you don't sleep enough you can be more stressed
SI114J-00279-P50022 1 SI114J-00279 13.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> or (%hesitation%) maybe you can be tired and so you don't have energy to spend during
SI114J-00279-P50023 1 SI114J-00279 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> use of technology can create a negative impact on people's life (%hesitation%) because technology makes you tired and (%hesitation%) it's (ver-) (neg-) very negative for you in general
SI114J-00283-P10005 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 17.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i love to learn about (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) foreign countries especially to developed countries because i want to know about their way of education and how these peoples get progress day by day
SI114J-00283-P10005 1 SI114J-00283 17.64 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so these are the factors i want to know
SI114J-00283-P10006 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 5.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> well during my free time i usually busy with social media
SI114J-00283-P10006 1 SI114J-00283 5.29 10.63 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) that includes facebook youtube and instagram
SI114J-00283-P10006 1 SI114J-00283 10.63 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i use them to talk with people sometimes with friends and strangers to just to fast my free time and to
SI114J-00283-P10007 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 15.10 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think the best way for me to enhance my english (%hesitation%) is doing more and more practice about listening reading speaking and writing because these are the four important factors of english
SI114J-00283-P10007 1 SI114J-00283 15.10 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> if you if i want to improve then (y-) i must do more and more practice on them
SI114J-00283-P10008 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 8.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i learn (%hesitation%) new skills it would be related to computer system also information technology
SI114J-00283-P10008 1 SI114J-00283 8.31 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it should includes (%hesitation%) softwares like java and other types because they are very important for me in future so i want to learn them all
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 13.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> during study the university students should do part time job in order to pay their university fees and other dues
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 13.25 17.52 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are cons and pros to this
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 17.52 22.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> so now i'm going to explain each and every one with more detail
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 22.91 29.07 <o,Q4,C,P3> number first one let's move towards the advantages
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 29.07 38.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) if the university student do part time job with their study then they will be able to pay their tuition fees and also the university fees
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 38.87 44.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> and secondly they are they will be more independent of their family
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 44.23 56.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages to this because students (%hesitation%) it takes time to do part time job and they will be inable to give more time to their study
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 56.58 60.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> and finally in my opinion so it is too good to
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 8.46 <o,Q3,B2,P4> well i'm going to explain the acid rain as well is its (%hesitation%) effect on the environment
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 8.46 10.04 <o,Q3,B2,P4> so a lot
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 10.04 24.54 <o,Q3,B2,P4> first of all let me explain lots of vehicles and industry they usually they usually explore (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) hazardous materials to the environment in the form of gases
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 24.54 26.27 <o,Q3,B2,P4> when these gases
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 26.27 29.94 <o,Q3,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) these gases contain some (%hesitation%) acid particles
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 29.94 38.73 <o,Q3,B2,P4> after that the acidic particles carried by winds and then mix with the measures of water in cloud
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 38.73 43.81 <o,Q3,B2,P4> after that a mixture is formed which is called acid rain
SI114J-00283-P40018 1 SI114J-00283 43.81 60.04 <o,Q3,B2,P4> when these acid rains falls on the surface of the environment (%hesitation%) like trees and (%hesitation%) fields and and buildings so they will affect the they will affect their properties because (%hesitation%) it is in acid
SI114J-00283-P50019 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 11.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm going to give advice (%hesitation%) to people who want to (%hesitation%) about (%hesitation%) about eating habit
SI114J-00283-P50019 1 SI114J-00283 11.07 16.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so they have to use a moderate type of eating
SI114J-00283-P50019 1 SI114J-00283 16.64 20.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) they must eat (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00283-P50020 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 12.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to drink (%hesitation%) much water because water is necessary for our health activities mostly in the metabolism reactions (%hesitation%) in our body
SI114J-00283-P50020 1 SI114J-00283 12.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so water also needed for (%hesitation%) circulation system in our body
SI114J-00283-P50021 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my opinion yes it is important to do some physical exercise every day because physical exercise exercise are more (%hesitation%) necessary for a good physical health
SI114J-00283-P50021 1 SI114J-00283 12.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so therefore i would suggest the people to do physical exercise mostly at morning time and also at evening
SI114J-00283-P50022 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 9.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it is true too people must sleep at least eight hours at night because this is the average time for sleep
SI114J-00283-P50022 1 SI114J-00283 9.48 17.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) if people sleep more than eight hours then it would be (%hesitation%) it would be affected for health
SI114J-00283-P50022 1 SI114J-00283 17.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also if they sleep
SI114J-00283-P50023 1 SI114J-00283 0.00 17.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology had both (%hesitation%) (bo-) both positive and negative effect on people health (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) technology provides (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) machineries to the people health and (w-) provides more benefits to the people
SI114J-00283-P50023 1 SI114J-00283 17.41 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also at the same time
SI114J-00284-P10005 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well it (%hesitation%) not so large place but theres there are lots of kind people who are always willing to help you out when you need it
SI114J-00284-P10006 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really enjoying going to the countryside with my friends or my family but due to that situation we have now (%hesitation%) i feel more like staying at home and reading a few books or writing
SI114J-00284-P10007 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 4.18 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it would definitely be my aunt silvia
SI114J-00284-P10007 1 SI114J-00284 4.18 17.30 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) she is my youngest aunt and we've always had a really strong bond like stronger than for example with my mother
SI114J-00284-P10007 1 SI114J-00284 17.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and yeah she would be it
SI114J-00284-P10008 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like something related to maths or science like an engineer or even a doctor but i have a couple of years ahead to made up my mind
SI114J-00284-P30017 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 19.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantage would be that they would be responsible for their university studies and they would not just drop out of college without having any money
SI114J-00284-P30017 1 SI114J-00284 19.12 31.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantages would be that they would have less time to dedicate it to their studies
SI114J-00284-P30017 1 SI114J-00284 31.35 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion parents (%hesitation%) should take responsibility for that if they have a lot of money but if not (%hesitation%) students should get jobs to pay for them
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 8.48 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you want to travel by plane you should just travel to the airport
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 8.48 12.48 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) do a check in
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 12.48 15.78 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) document control
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 15.78 21.35 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you will have to go through security first
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 21.35 28.62 <o,Q4,B1,P4> wait when you can go shopping or eating something
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 28.62 37.25 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) you could also use the bathroom or even go to a restaurant if you want
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 37.25 49.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then you will have to go on board with the cabin crew who would give you all the answers you need to know
SI114J-00284-P40018 1 SI114J-00284 49.51 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then the plane will finally go off
SI114J-00284-P50019 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can talk to professors online or professor who have an youtube account and they can also download applications to improve their english for example
SI114J-00284-P50020 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's true because not all teachers have the best technology acknowledgement to do a online class well enough
SI114J-00284-P50021 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 8.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> most of the jobs they will have in the future are based on a group
SI114J-00284-P50021 1 SI114J-00284 8.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they will have a boss and they will have colleagues with whom they do their projects
SI114J-00284-P50022 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion yes because they would be able to see other people's perspective about the matter (%hesitation%) which will open up their minds
SI114J-00284-P50023 1 SI114J-00284 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 7.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think all students would benefit from this (%hesitation%) fitness classes
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 7.21 16.06 <o,Q5,C,P3> first it promotes the health not only body health also mind health
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 16.06 29.43 <o,Q5,C,P3> and it's proved that when young people also (%hesitation%) besides the study they do sports then they give best resultats in studies
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 29.43 41.84 <o,Q5,C,P3> also the one disadvantage is that schools usually don't have (%hesitation%) much time for these (%hesitation%) activities so the the time is limited
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 41.84 54.14 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion there is no enough time in the schools dedicated to do these kind of fitness classes these kinds of activities
SI114J-00289-P30017 1 SI114J-00289 54.14 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think they should spend more time on this because it's beneficial to all
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 4.87 <o,Q5,C,P4> well we'll be explaining how honey is produced
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 4.87 9.03 <o,Q5,C,P4> first the bees collect the nectar from flowers
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 9.03 13.51 <o,Q5,C,P4> then the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 13.51 26.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the beekeepers collect honey from beehives and they bottle in the jars they put the honey in the jars
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 26.85 44.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this this honey is (%hesitation%) between (%hesitation%) by cars and vans are distributed to different supermarkets where you can find the bees
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 44.77 56.07 <o,Q5,C,P4> this is basically the (%hesitation%) all the process of (%hesitation%) from the bee to the supermarket process
SI114J-00289-P40018 1 SI114J-00289 56.07 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and why we can get there (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00289-P50019 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 3.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think they have to consider the culture
SI114J-00289-P50019 1 SI114J-00289 3.71 8.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00289-P50019 1 SI114J-00289 8.62 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but you have to consider if you like that culture
SI114J-00289-P50019 1 SI114J-00289 12.77 17.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you have (%hesitation%) you want to get to know that culture
SI114J-00289-P50019 1 SI114J-00289 17.59 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's the important thing
SI114J-00289-P50020 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 12.40 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well also you can benefit from it at (%hesitation%) getting a job because it's (%hesitation%) it's one plus that you have (%hesitation%) in your resume
SI114J-00289-P50020 1 SI114J-00289 12.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also helps you develop your mind of think think
SI114J-00289-P50021 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 14.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the most difficult thing they would find to study in other country is being far away from his family from his friends and have all the affection it's far away
SI114J-00289-P50021 1 SI114J-00289 14.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but today with the technologies we can get nearer
SI114J-00289-P50022 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 10.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well you can they can understand the culture they can understand (%hesitation%) why they behave (%hesitation%) like they behave
SI114J-00289-P50022 1 SI114J-00289 10.08 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you have to open your mind and be okay with getting things done in other
SI114J-00289-P50023 1 SI114J-00289 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with this because i think being far away from their family their parents their friends (%hesitation%) you have to get all by yourself maybe the food and getting the groceries all kind of things that you can learn
SI114J-00296-P10005 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 3.42 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm very interested in music
SI114J-00296-P10005 1 SI114J-00296 3.42 5.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> i can play the guitar
SI114J-00296-P10005 1 SI114J-00296 5.03 12.04 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been to i have been play the guitar since when i was maybe twelve years old
SI114J-00296-P10005 1 SI114J-00296 12.04 18.21 <o,Q5,C,P1> i interacted with many foreigners with (%hesitation%) playing the guitar

SI114J-00296-P10006 1 SI114J-00296 5.33 12.68 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) venice was the most beautiful place i've ever been
SI114J-00296-P10006 1 SI114J-00296 12.68 18.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i also been to canada and i talked with many foreigners
SI114J-00296-P10006 1 SI114J-00296 18.94 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i
SI114J-00296-P10007 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 9.35 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would like to meet taylor swift swift because i like taylor swift the songs
SI114J-00296-P10007 1 SI114J-00296 9.35 14.23 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i listen to her music every day
SI114J-00296-P10007 1 SI114J-00296 14.23 17.93 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i can play her music with the guitar
SI114J-00296-P10007 1 SI114J-00296 17.93 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i sometimes (si-)
SI114J-00296-P10008 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 6.73 <o,Q5,C,P1> it definitely help me because i would like to be a commercial pilot in the future
SI114J-00296-P10008 1 SI114J-00296 6.73 10.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i (%hesitation%) learning english very hard
SI114J-00296-P10008 1 SI114J-00296 10.88 16.83 <o,Q5,C,P1> but i think i don't have enough speaking skills to be a commercial pilot
SI114J-00296-P10008 1 SI114J-00296 16.83 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so if it's possible i would like to (s-)
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 7.89 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well first the advantage is (%hesitation%) they can speak they can work internationally
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 7.89 16.57 <o,Q5,B2,P3> these days are (internationali-) internationalisation so it helps student
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 16.57 28.50 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand the the disadvantage is they might lose the appetite to study what they are they truly want to study
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 28.50 49.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion as long as (%hesitation%) (studen-) students can spend plenty of time to study what they want to learn it's (%hesitation%) studying at least one foreign language in university is very good idea
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 49.31 58.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> as you can see as you can as you know there are many people who can speak more than two language
SI114J-00296-P30017 1 SI114J-00296 58.05 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so
SI114J-00296-P50019 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 8.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) it is the best to find
SI114J-00296-P50019 1 SI114J-00296 8.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> watching b b c is the best way to find international news because it's written by in english
SI114J-00296-P50020 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 13.12 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes i agree with the idea because these days (%hesitation%) there we can see whole news or newspapers on the internet
SI114J-00296-P50020 1 SI114J-00296 13.12 18.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> we almost everyone use smart phone or a computer
SI114J-00296-P50020 1 SI114J-00296 18.07 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we don't need
SI114J-00296-P50021 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 9.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it depends on situation because (%hesitation%) it should social media everyone can write anything
SI114J-00296-P50021 1 SI114J-00296 9.80 18.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the importance is (%hesitation%) i you have to identify whether it's (%hesitation%) true or not
SI114J-00296-P50021 1 SI114J-00296 18.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> or fake
SI114J-00296-P50022 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 8.74 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion it isn't important to (%hesitation%) know (a-) know about local news
SI114J-00296-P50022 1 SI114J-00296 8.74 15.05 <o,Q5,C,P5> because almost every local news is usually common
SI114J-00296-P50022 1 SI114J-00296 15.05 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it isn't important to you
SI114J-00296-P50023 1 SI114J-00296 0.00 2.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think so
SI114J-00296-P50023 1 SI114J-00296 2.27 13.48 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) although i sometimes watch see bad news on news media (%hesitation%) i often see very good news
SI114J-00296-P50023 1 SI114J-00296 13.48 18.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> for example someone (%hesitation%) helped a old man
SI114J-00296-P50023 1 SI114J-00296 18.13 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> or

SI114J-00298-P10007 1 SI114J-00298 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i suppose trying to use the language and reading a lot of texts of the in in english and and maybe you were doing exercise

SI114J-00298-P30017 1 SI114J-00298 0.00 10.42 <o,Q3,B2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they have more advantages

SI114J-00300-P50019 1 SI114J-00300 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my my recommendation is to have (%hesitation%) different (%hesitation%) apps to help you to organise your time (%hesitation%) reminders for to different (%hesitation%) things to do and don't confuse
SI114J-00300-P50020 1 SI114J-00300 0.00 1.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> course
SI114J-00300-P50020 1 SI114J-00300 1.04 9.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i am totally totally (%hesitation%) according to this because (%hesitation%) i am from the old school
SI114J-00300-P50020 1 SI114J-00300 9.60 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i need to have to the professor to ask my questions and to have different (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00300-P50021 1 SI114J-00300 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) a good question because (%hesitation%) when you work with a group (%hesitation%) you develop your skills to (%hesitation%) to manage different (%hesitation%) people different time different
SI114J-00300-P50022 1 SI114J-00300 0.00 13.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> of course because when you are attending when you are attending lectures you you are exposed to (%hesitation%) new ideas from the from different people
SI114J-00300-P50022 1 SI114J-00300 13.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) and when you are (%hesitation%) reading alone you are exposed to your
SI114J-00300-P50023 1 SI114J-00300 0.00 2.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's very important
SI114J-00300-P50023 1 SI114J-00300 2.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because if you have a wonderful space where you can study you probably you could concentrate more in your (%hesitation%) project in your study area (%hesitation%) than if you
SI114J-00302-P10005 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 13.21 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries because when i learn about the other country i can also learn about our own countries
SI114J-00302-P10005 1 SI114J-00302 13.21 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i can compare (%hesitation%) many things between the two countries
SI114J-00302-P10006 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 14.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my free time i usually enjoy jogging because (%hesitation%) when i do jogging i can feel breeze outside and also i can enjoy the birds singing
SI114J-00302-P10006 1 SI114J-00302 14.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that is very relaxing to me
SI114J-00302-P10007 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way for me to improve english is that (%hesitation%) watching (%hesitation%) english movies because (%hesitation%) by means of the watching english movies i can learn how to pronounce the words exactly
SI114J-00302-P10008 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i would like to get the skill to play piano properly because (%hesitation%) if i can play piano i can (%hesitation%) express my feeling through the piano playing and (%hesitation%) that is very (%hesitation%) relaxing to me
SI114J-00302-P30017 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 22.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> given that (%hesitation%) all university students do part time jobs while they are studying the advantage is that (%hesitation%) they can learn how they can apply their knowledge to (%hesitation%) their job or in a real society
SI114J-00302-P30017 1 SI114J-00302 22.71 34.84 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) they have to spend their (%hesitation%) learning time to prepare their job
SI114J-00302-P30017 1 SI114J-00302 34.84 39.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> that result in (%hesitation%) reducing their learning time
SI114J-00302-P30017 1 SI114J-00302 39.71 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion (%hesitation%) all university students should do part time jobs because while they can learn how to apply their skill to the real life maybe their learning skill is also improved

SI114J-00302-P40018 1 SI114J-00302 41.48 49.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this rain or snowing are falling to the ground and these are known as (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) acid rain
SI114J-00302-P40018 1 SI114J-00302 49.77 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) these acid rain can (%hesitation%) put negative impact on the ground or trees
SI114J-00302-P50019 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 12.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you like to have eating good eating habits the best way is to (%hesitation%) have three meals per day regularly
SI114J-00302-P50019 1 SI114J-00302 12.27 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> one is breakfast the other is lunch and the last one is dinner
SI114J-00302-P50020 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 9.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> drinking a lot of water is very important because our body is made of (%hesitation%) seventy percent water
SI114J-00302-P50020 1 SI114J-00302 9.96 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so if we don't have enough amount of water that can cause a very heavy (%hesitation%) disease
SI114J-00302-P50021 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion doing exercise every day is not so (%hesitation%) essential but just keep (%hesitation%) doing exercises twice a week that can improve your health enough
SI114J-00302-P50022 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think that everyone need (%hesitation%) eight hours sleeping because (%hesitation%) sleeping time totally depends on that person

SI114J-00302-P50022 1 SI114J-00302 17.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that depends on the person totally
SI114J-00302-P50023 1 SI114J-00302 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the technology generally have a negative impact on our health because (%hesitation%) we usually (%hesitation%) develop technology to reduce our labour force and that causes a low doing exercises

SI114J-00304-P30017 1 SI114J-00304 0.00 8.03 <o,Q4,C,P3> all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI114J-00304-P30017 1 SI114J-00304 8.03 10.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> there are pros and cons
SI114J-00304-P30017 1 SI114J-00304 10.02 19.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> for the advantages i would say it's very be very useful for them to find a job (%hesitation%) when they need some foreign languages
SI114J-00304-P30017 1 SI114J-00304 19.99 29.27 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also learning another foreign language will help them to better understand the culture which the country have own

SI114J-00304-P30017 1 SI114J-00304 40.41 47.36 <o,Q4,C,P3> because sometimes it's not easy to get hang of a new foreign language in short terms

SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 10.45 18.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all you have to travel to by airport by transportations such as cars buses and trains
SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 18.31 23.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then arriving at after arriving at the airport you (ha-) all you have to do is three phases
SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 23.77 28.74 <o,Q5,C,P4> the first of all you have to check in in front of a check in counter by airlines
SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 28.74 32.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the second you have to go document control
SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 32.02 38.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> if you board on international flights you have to submit your passport to the airport staff
SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 38.58 41.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you are you you are boarding

SI114J-00314-P40018 1 SI114J-00314 57.74 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so i think this is all

SI114J-00314-P50020 1 SI114J-00314 0.00 3.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it depends on the situation
SI114J-00314-P50020 1 SI114J-00314 3.01 10.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because the students living in (%hesitation%) near the (st-) (%hesitation%) university it is very effective for them

SI114J-00314-P50021 1 SI114J-00314 14.42 18.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the leader has to integrated those opinions or ideas

SI114J-00315-P50023 1 SI114J-00315 0.00 7.17 <o,Q5,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think that is true
SI114J-00315-P50023 1 SI114J-00315 7.17 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> because when you live in the other country on the other flat alone you must learn from (big-)

SI114J-00316-P10006 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 4.22 <o,Q5,C,P1> i actually enjoy being lazy a little bit
SI114J-00316-P10006 1 SI114J-00316 4.22 9.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like just being on the sofa reading or watching tv
SI114J-00316-P10006 1 SI114J-00316 9.41 15.14 <o,Q5,C,P1> but i also want like hiking in the woods with my dogs
SI114J-00316-P10006 1 SI114J-00316 15.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and they prefer that option than being lazy to be honest

SI114J-00316-P10008 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 8.08 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would like to be a university professor and that's where i'm trying to go with my academic career

SI114J-00316-P10008 1 SI114J-00316 14.29 17.17 <o,Q5,C,P1> maybe i'll stay in a research center and that's ok too
SI114J-00316-P10008 1 SI114J-00316 17.17 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's it's good
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 7.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> i do think students should get (%hesitation%) part time jobs while they're studying at university

SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 12.39 22.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> and also obviously (%hesitation%) they will have their own money to spend it any way they want (%hesitation%) even if they want to save or they want to spend it it's just their money
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 22.48 27.33 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i do not think that these jobs should be to pay for the university study
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 27.33 30.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> should be an extra
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 30.23 38.38 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think scholarships should be more widely available to students so they wouldn't have to worry about paying for their studies
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 38.38 39.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> they just

SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 42.31 52.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> we we will need to pay them for our new generations because of course maybe if they are working a full time job their grades will suffer
SI114J-00316-P30017 1 SI114J-00316 52.52 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> but if it's a part time job maybe they will have more time to study and just prepare themselves for the life after (univers-)
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 10.05 <o,Q5,C,P4> travelling by plane (%hesitation%) can be anxiety inducing because you need to plan with a lot of time and just pass the controls
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 10.05 14.52 <o,Q5,C,P4> and but if you just organise yourself it's easier
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 14.52 16.59 <o,Q5,C,P4> first you need to travel to the airport
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 16.59 24.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can go there by bus by your own car or train or you need to look before at alternatives
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 24.45 26.90 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to check in
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 26.90 29.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> it's easier if you check in online
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 29.14 33.96 <o,Q5,C,P4> now that you have your own boarding ticket in your phone it's easier
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 33.96 38.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to go through document control and security
SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 38.38 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> that's that can be (%hesitation%) a problem if it's (%hesitation%) the rush hour and there are a lot of people but usually if you just have your all all your things organise it'll be quick and you'll have time to wait and just eat something go to the bathroom and before it's time to board and just leave
SI114J-00316-P50019 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can use technology like their computer or even their phone to search (%hesitation%) for concepts they don't understand maybe
SI114J-00316-P50019 1 SI114J-00316 10.59 18.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's easier than going through books in the reference part of the the curriculum of the course
SI114J-00316-P50019 1 SI114J-00316 18.38 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it just (wikiped-)
SI114J-00316-P50020 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 13.51 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes i believe learning face to face in a classroom environment is much easier than just doing online classes like it's in it's happening now with the pandemia with coronavirus
SI114J-00316-P50020 1 SI114J-00316 13.51 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but (%hesitation%) maybe technology with zoom meetings more organised can be of help
SI114J-00316-P50021 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 10.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> honestly patience because group projects can be very bad if you're the (on-) the only one who is doing anything
SI114J-00316-P50021 1 SI114J-00316 10.26 14.17 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you need patience and learn to work as a group
SI114J-00316-P50021 1 SI114J-00316 14.17 18.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> and everybody needs to contribute something but with patience
SI114J-00316-P50021 1 SI114J-00316 18.98 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah that's the key
SI114J-00316-P50022 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 8.78 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes because after attending a lecture maybe you're not paid a lot of attention but you got something
SI114J-00316-P50022 1 SI114J-00316 8.78 11.89 <o,Q5,C,P5> you heard some the professor talk about some things
SI114J-00316-P50022 1 SI114J-00316 11.89 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and then when you go over the the curriculum then when you read alone you'll remember what the professor (s-)
SI114J-00316-P50023 1 SI114J-00316 0.00 5.21 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is very important because it's the only way to go forward
SI114J-00316-P50023 1 SI114J-00316 5.21 14.05 <o,Q5,C,P5> and university who don't want to adapt to the modern world well they'll fall behind in the in the charts for best university of the year
SI114J-00316-P50023 1 SI114J-00316 14.05 18.55 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it it will just be bad for them because less students will enrol
SI114J-00316-P50023 1 SI114J-00316 18.55 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so they need to

SI114J-00323-P30017 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 24.10 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the advantages to the foreign language is you can the opportunity for learn a new language and you you can travel to the world and you you can understand the language of this country
SI114J-00323-P30017 1 SI114J-00323 24.10 33.73 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but if you don't understand this language it's more complicate to visit the place
SI114J-00323-P30017 1 SI114J-00323 33.73 43.88 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is don't don't have the time to learn this language
SI114J-00323-P30017 1 SI114J-00323 43.88 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> my opinion is that study one language is better for our future in the university
SI114J-00323-P50019 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the best international news for student is the internet because you can find anything that you you should like the
SI114J-00323-P50020 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i agree because in the future the newspaper disappear (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) more people read the news in the on the internet and is more easy
SI114J-00323-P50021 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the social media is better influence than the new because people is young and they enjoy with social media
SI114J-00323-P50022 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> is very important because people need to know the local news for keep informed to pass in the local country
SI114J-00323-P50023 1 SI114J-00323 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that is important to know bad news because you need to to know if if it happen bad thing
SI114J-00326-P10005 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 4.38 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm now living in manila which is the capital city of the philippines
SI114J-00326-P10005 1 SI114J-00326 4.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it is a hot and humid city because it has only one (se-) season which is summer and it is a crowded city with many traffic
SI114J-00326-P10006 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 9.70 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i have holiday i always go travel together with my mother and my dog because i like to visit different places together with my families
SI114J-00326-P10006 1 SI114J-00326 9.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i feel relaxed and comfortable when i am staying somewhere with beautiful views
SI114J-00326-P10007 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 7.30 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to spend time with my dog most because he loves me so much
SI114J-00326-P10007 1 SI114J-00326 7.30 13.61 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i am seeing him i feel like i am the most significant person in the world because i am his whole world
SI114J-00326-P10007 1 SI114J-00326 13.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so whenever i feel upset i will just hug him and i will feel much better
SI114J-00326-P10008 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i could choose i would become a psychologist because (%hesitation%) some people including me will feel upset when under when suffering from the difficulties in our lives
SI114J-00326-P10008 1 SI114J-00326 13.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would feel happy if i could help people and make them feel better
SI114J-00326-P30017 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 24.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantage of a student to get jobs to pay for his university studies is that (%hesitation%) he or she can gain some job (ex-) experience and it would help him after he graduated from school and (%hesitation%) for his employment
SI114J-00326-P30017 1 SI114J-00326 24.06 29.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and also (%hesitation%) he will have less stress and has steady payment
SI114J-00326-P30017 1 SI114J-00326 29.55 42.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantages is that it might (%hesitation%) it might cost their time so that they cannot concentrate on their studies
SI114J-00326-P30017 1 SI114J-00326 42.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion (%hesitation%) it's good for us to get a job while studying in university but we have to (%hesitation%) balance the time we are spending on jobs and our studies
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 10.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the first time the first first step (%hesitation%) of travelling by airplane is that you have to go to the airport
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 10.86 20.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) you can ride (%hesitation%) whether subway or bus or car
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 20.95 31.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after you arrive the airport you have to go to check in desk and check in and get your boarding pass
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 31.74 37.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they will check your document and you will go through a security check
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 37.41 44.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that you just find your airplane gate and wait there until the boarding time
SI114J-00326-P40018 1 SI114J-00326 44.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after the broadcast is calling the your airplane you can board on the airplane and then you fly
SI114J-00326-P50019 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 14.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology helps us a lot a lot (%hesitation%) when studying because it is it makes our studying more convenient and it is a good source of informations
SI114J-00326-P50019 1 SI114J-00326 14.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and we can (%hesitation%) use the search engine to search
SI114J-00326-P50020 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> actually face to face (%hesitation%) interaction is better than online because (%hesitation%) if we learn face to face with a teacher we can understand more about her words and her teaching
SI114J-00326-P50021 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> by working together with other (%hesitation%) group mates it can develop our skills on teamworking and also (s-) maybe our skills on leadership and communicate with others solving problems (toge-)

SI114J-00326-P50023 1 SI114J-00326 0.00 1.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it is
SI114J-00326-P50023 1 SI114J-00326 1.88 8.91 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course it's necessary for like students to have better learning facilities
SI114J-00326-P50023 1 SI114J-00326 8.91 17.67 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but also (%hesitation%) it's not like (%hesitation%) student study is not depend on the (f-) facilities
SI114J-00326-P50023 1 SI114J-00326 17.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is depend on a student

SI114J-00333-P50023 1 SI114J-00333 5.28 15.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's true that technology (%hesitation%) facilitate our life (%hesitation%) every every day coz we have mobile phone we can search a lot of information
SI114J-00333-P50023 1 SI114J-00333 15.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it is also a downside
SI114J-00335-P10005 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 8.65 <o,Q5,B2,P1> yeah i'm very interested in learning about foreign countries about foreign culture foreign politics

SI114J-00335-P10006 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i think i really enjoy playing football doing exercises being with friends talking a lot drinking beers and (%hesitation%) having parties i dunno travelling a lot
SI114J-00335-P10007 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i am sure that the best way is practising a lot having and finding times moments places where you can use it communicate a lot with foreign people foreign friends and use tools new tools
SI114J-00335-P10008 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 5.47 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm sure it would be being more patient

SI114J-00335-P10008 1 SI114J-00335 18.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm sure that
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 9.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i tend to think that (%hesitation%) students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 9.92 12.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's really important for them
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 12.45 25.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they will be able to look for a job in the future and have more skills and work experience
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 25.63 27.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it's really important
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 27.87 35.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) they won't be able to use all their time to study to focus on the study
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 35.86 49.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the average it (%hesitation%) necessary i think i mean it's mandatory to should do part times jobs while they were studying
SI114J-00335-P30017 1 SI114J-00335 49.00 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it will be very helpful for them for all of them

SI114J-00335-P40018 1 SI114J-00335 9.38 21.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollutions means that acid particles goes to the air in the way of smoke
SI114J-00335-P40018 1 SI114J-00335 21.42 51.64 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by wind and some of them fall as dust but others mix with cloud water and it could finish in being part of (%hesitation%) rain or (%hesitation%) snowing and (%hesitation%) falling in that way causing disaster (%hesitation%) for our environment
SI114J-00335-P40018 1 SI114J-00335 51.64 54.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is a really important matter
SI114J-00335-P40018 1 SI114J-00335 54.60 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so
SI114J-00335-P50019 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i would say to everybody that (%hesitation%) what is really good for me it's eating food without (%hesitation%) fat and (%hesitation%) avoid to processing food
SI114J-00335-P50020 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 8.15 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's (%hesitation%) really important too important to drink water (%hesitation%) during a day

SI114J-00335-P50021 1 SI114J-00335 2.17 7.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's very important to do exercise every day
SI114J-00335-P50021 1 SI114J-00335 7.21 18.45 <o,Q5,B2,P5> people to feel healthy and to have healthy lifestyle needs to do exercise every day (%hesitation%) minimum thirty minutes a day
SI114J-00335-P50021 1 SI114J-00335 18.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it could be enough
SI114J-00335-P50022 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 2.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that
SI114J-00335-P50022 1 SI114J-00335 2.75 19.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) people need need to to sleep (%hesitation%) at minimum eight hours a day to be relaxed and to be energetic (%hesitation%) when they woke up
SI114J-00335-P50022 1 SI114J-00335 19.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's
SI114J-00335-P50023 1 SI114J-00335 0.00 6.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it depends on the context in which (%hesitation%) we are talking about technology
SI114J-00335-P50023 1 SI114J-00335 6.25 15.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if (%hesitation%) we think about (%hesitation%) medical care technology definitely helps (%hesitation%) people
SI114J-00335-P50023 1 SI114J-00335 15.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) another way we don't know
SI114J-00337-P10005 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i try to take care of our environment as much as possible because i really think that we have to (%hesitation%) discuss with the climate change because it's really dangerous
SI114J-00337-P10006 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 8.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we try to spend our free time practicing different sports (%hesitation%) for example tennis
SI114J-00337-P10006 1 SI114J-00337 8.58 14.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and as well we try to visit other countries

SI114J-00337-P10007 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the way i see it it's my sister the most similar because she is in (%hesitation%) senior eight so we have more or less the same interests and we have to try to do things together
SI114J-00337-P10008 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to live in united kingdom specifically in wales because i lived there (%hesitation%) two years ago and i would like to go back there
SI114J-00337-P30017 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 7.54 <o,Q3,B2,P3> as a p e teacher i think i have a good opinion about the subject
SI114J-00337-P30017 1 SI114J-00337 7.54 20.07 <o,Q3,B2,P3> if i have to speak about the advantages i think it's remarkable that (%hesitation%) students will feel better with themselves
SI114J-00337-P30017 1 SI114J-00337 20.07 33.49 <o,Q3,B2,P3> and if i have to choose one disadvantage i this it will be that some students don't like a lot to practise sports
SI114J-00337-P30017 1 SI114J-00337 33.49 37.53 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so be less reward for them
SI114J-00337-P30017 1 SI114J-00337 37.53 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> the way i see it (%hesitation%) it is that we have to try to do it in schools but especially in the universities and college because video games and tvs are (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00337-P40018 1 SI114J-00337 0.00 8.62 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well first of all we can see that bees make honey from nectar in bee hives
SI114J-00337-P40018 1 SI114J-00337 8.62 14.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they transport it to flowers
SI114J-00337-P40018 1 SI114J-00337 14.30 28.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so after it beekeepers (%hesitation%) will be able to collect honey and to put it in some glass bottles or similars
SI114J-00337-P40018 1 SI114J-00337 28.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the next step will be than a van (%hesitation%) will come to take it and put it in supermarkets and shops

SI114J-00337-P50023 1 SI114J-00337 3.07 14.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to cook on your own and to wash your dishes to wash (%hesitation%) your clothes
SI114J-00337-P50023 1 SI114J-00337 14.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so of course yeah it will be a really good experience
SI114J-00339-P30017 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 6.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> well the statement it offers a host of (%hesitation%) benefits
SI114J-00339-P30017 1 SI114J-00339 6.92 23.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> one thing that really stands out is that (%hesitation%) students (%hesitation%) can learn how to spend their money and how manage they time and et cetera
SI114J-00339-P30017 1 SI114J-00339 23.13 29.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) well in my view (%hesitation%) they have a number of shortcomings
SI114J-00339-P30017 1 SI114J-00339 29.21 51.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there is no doubt that the most significant is that (%hesitation%) get jobs to pay their university studies (%hesitation%) have a bad effect on their studies know because (%hesitation%) they couldn't have focused on their studies
SI114J-00339-P30017 1 SI114J-00339 51.42 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> and in my opinion it's really important that the students (%hesitation%) just have focus on their (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00339-P40018 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 10.36 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the diagram shows the different stages in the process of travelling by airplane
SI114J-00339-P40018 1 SI114J-00339 10.36 34.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) as can be seen (%hesitation%) at the first stage (%hesitation%) for travelling to airport (%hesitation%) we have to get a taxi take a taxi or buses or use of metro (%hesitation%) in order to get into the airport
SI114J-00339-P40018 1 SI114J-00339 34.52 47.19 <o,Q5,B2,P4> following that (%hesitation%) check in and documents control and after that the security (%hesitation%) you have to pass
SI114J-00339-P40018 1 SI114J-00339 47.19 55.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) you wait into the salon (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) for a moment
SI114J-00339-P40018 1 SI114J-00339 55.23 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) after that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) you have to board the
SI114J-00339-P50019 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i'm in opinion that (%hesitation%) technology is the best way for studying and learning because it provide a wide range of (%hesitation%) information in websites (%hesitation%) that can you find everything that you want for learning
SI114J-00339-P50020 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 13.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) face to face with a teacher is (%hesitation%) is the best way for learning because we can see the body language of the teacher or the students
SI114J-00339-P50020 1 SI114J-00339 13.46 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) also (%hesitation%) the feeling about the sentences we can catch
SI114J-00339-P50021 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) work in a team (%hesitation%) at the group projects it's a (%hesitation%) it provides a great opportunity to broaden (%hesitation%) students' horizons and also learns from others
SI114J-00339-P50022 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 2.40 <o,Q5,C,P5> not at all
SI114J-00339-P50022 1 SI114J-00339 2.40 8.85 <o,Q5,C,P5> actually (%hesitation%) reading alone is most effective than attending lectures
SI114J-00339-P50022 1 SI114J-00339 8.85 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00339-P50023 1 SI114J-00339 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> actually modern (%hesitation%) learning facilities can improve (%hesitation%) the motivation and the passion of the students for studying and learning and (%hesitation%) you know (%hesitation%) make (%hesitation%) the teaching enjoyable for (st-) (%hesitation%) students
SI114J-00342-P10005 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 5.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interesting that's why i go on holidays every time i can
SI114J-00342-P10005 1 SI114J-00342 5.62 12.38 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love food and i try to (%hesitation%) learned the new food from another countries
SI114J-00342-P10005 1 SI114J-00342 12.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i also love languages so i try to speak that language and meet people from the new country
SI114J-00342-P10006 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 8.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love sports so when i have time i play tennis with my friends and i surf when i can
SI114J-00342-P10006 1 SI114J-00342 8.36 14.51 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i also love music so i try to go to some concerts every day
SI114J-00342-P10006 1 SI114J-00342 14.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love (%hesitation%) music live
SI114J-00342-P10007 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for me the best way is by speaking
SI114J-00342-P10007 1 SI114J-00342 4.34 11.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i have english friends which i try to speak to him (%hesitation%) every two three days
SI114J-00342-P10007 1 SI114J-00342 11.13 14.54 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i also watch english movie every night
SI114J-00342-P10007 1 SI114J-00342 14.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like to use subtitle with the movies so i can read the writing words
SI114J-00342-P10008 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 4.08 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to learn how to paint with watercolour
SI114J-00342-P10008 1 SI114J-00342 4.08 14.29 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i know that it's very difficult so i joined to a class a couple of months ago and finally i'm learning the best way to paint
SI114J-00342-P10008 1 SI114J-00342 14.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i have a great teacher which who gave me some nice tips
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 12.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> some of the advantage that students might find when they have a part time jobs are that they can get they can earn money so they can help to pay their studies
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 12.14 17.30 <o,Q4,C,P3> they also become more mature (%hesitation%) when they work
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 17.30 21.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) and also they know the value of money
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 21.13 26.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) they can't also feel more confident at work
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 26.02 39.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> in the other side the disadvantage are that some students are no good in languages so it may takes for them to learn the language and to approve and to pass the subject
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 39.91 47.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> and then of all the also they are not focus on other subjects which may be more important their degree
SI114J-00342-P30017 1 SI114J-00342 47.95 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> my conclusion is that part time jobs should be good for the student but not essentialled for them
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 5.29 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the acid rains is very dangerous for our environment
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 5.29 11.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) so the factories and vehicles create pollutions
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 11.22 19.37 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and that pollution inside the pollution are the acid partics which are in the smoke
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 19.37 28.50 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some of the acid partics are carried by the wind and fall down as a dust in the ground
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 28.50 34.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the other acid partic (%hesitation%) mix with the the cloud water
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 34.34 50.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when it's raining or snow the acid partic fall in the ground or in the water (%hesitation%) damaging the trees so the trees become weaker and weaker until they die
SI114J-00342-P40018 1 SI114J-00342 50.95 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and if the acid particle falls in the water they would kill the fishes which means that we don't have
SI114J-00342-P50019 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 6.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it's how i (%hesitation%) the best way to start my day is having breakfast
SI114J-00342-P50019 1 SI114J-00342 6.12 11.92 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's (hea-) a healthy way to have some vegetables instead of sugar
SI114J-00342-P50019 1 SI114J-00342 11.92 18.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and another way is to eat fish (%hesitation%) at least two time per week
SI114J-00342-P50019 1 SI114J-00342 18.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) eat (veg-)
SI114J-00342-P50020 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 5.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think we should drink between two two to three liters every day
SI114J-00342-P50020 1 SI114J-00342 5.63 13.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> our body is made of waters like i think the seventy percent of of us are water
SI114J-00342-P50020 1 SI114J-00342 13.25 15.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we need it to survive
SI114J-00342-P50020 1 SI114J-00342 15.62 18.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if we don't drink water we die
SI114J-00342-P50020 1 SI114J-00342 18.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's also worth
SI114J-00342-P50021 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 7.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we should do some exercise between two to three days per week
SI114J-00342-P50021 1 SI114J-00342 7.38 14.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we can also improve our health (%hesitation%) by walking at least half an hour every day
SI114J-00342-P50021 1 SI114J-00342 14.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so at the ends is health to work out like five
SI114J-00342-P50022 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 6.47 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we should sleep between seven to eight hours every night
SI114J-00342-P50022 1 SI114J-00342 6.47 14.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if we don't sleep we are not able to to think and to develop our ideas properly
SI114J-00342-P50022 1 SI114J-00342 14.36 18.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also sleeping is good for our skin
SI114J-00342-P50022 1 SI114J-00342 18.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it keeps us beautiful
SI114J-00342-P50023 1 SI114J-00342 0.00 4.45 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in general i think has beens very good for our health
SI114J-00342-P50023 1 SI114J-00342 4.45 12.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00342-P50023 1 SI114J-00342 12.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so now nowadays we are able to live more years because we have a lot of machine which provide us
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 0.00 4.19 <o,Q5,C,P4> the origin of acid rain is pollution
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 4.19 14.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> pollution coming from factories and vehicles is (%hesitation%) transformed in acid particles that are carried by the wind
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 14.04 19.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> this acid particles fall down to earth in two ways
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 19.63 24.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> on one hand there are acid particles falling down as dust
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 24.84 37.16 <o,Q5,C,P4> on the other hand some acid particles combine with cloud (%hesitation%) water or snow and fall down as rain or snow (%hesitation%) on earth
SI114J-00343-P40018 1 SI114J-00343 37.16 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> both acid particles and acid rain or acid snow are the main cause of damage to the environment
SI114J-00345-P10005 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 10.24 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) let me put it this way (%hesitation%) i've been learn english for almost six years or so and i've arrived at the conclusion that the cultural thing comes to your mind unconsciously
SI114J-00345-P10005 1 SI114J-00345 10.24 14.01 <o,Q5,B2,P1> because in my case (%hesitation%) i always listen to the british radio station
SI114J-00345-P10005 1 SI114J-00345 14.01 20.28 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i don't really pay attention to all those you know little details that the that the that the person
SI114J-00345-P10006 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 13.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) well every time i have leisure time which unfortunately is not my case because i have to work all day long (%hesitation%) i like making some calls and invite some friends over uh huh to eat dinner here at home
SI114J-00345-P10006 1 SI114J-00345 13.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> or we could even go to a pub have of a couple of drinks play play some pool and you know play
SI114J-00345-P10007 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 3.67 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) i haven't (%hesitation%) run into an effective method
SI114J-00345-P10007 1 SI114J-00345 3.67 17.73 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but the one that i've used recently and has given me amazing results is by (%hesitation%) listen to the to the to the radio and watching programmes (%hesitation%) in english without subtitles
SI114J-00345-P10007 1 SI114J-00345 17.73 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and believe it or not i've improved
SI114J-00345-P10008 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 11.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> all right (%hesitation%) given the choice (%hesitation%) i would probably say i would like to master any instrument although i haven't bought one but i have searched once to do it in the future
SI114J-00345-P10008 1 SI114J-00345 11.52 16.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) many people find (%hesitation%) learning an instrument quite baffling
SI114J-00345-P10008 1 SI114J-00345 16.13 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but because (i-) (i-) sometimes it's hard uh huh to get
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 4.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> all right teachers (%hesitation%) welcome to this presentation on part time jobs
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 4.42 9.11 <o,Q4,C,P3> now (%hesitation%) before going any further (%hesitation%) i would like to say thank you for coming by
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 9.11 16.84 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i will try to be i will try to be as brief as possible so please (%hesitation%) just stick around for a couple of minutes right
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 16.84 32.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> now one of the advantages of letting your students do part time jobs (%hesitation%) while they're studying is that once they finish (%hesitation%) let's say let's say studying their degree uh huh they will be able to find a job yeah easier than than the rest
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 32.88 35.44 <o,Q4,C,P3> so for me that is a huge advantage
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 35.44 49.94 <o,Q4,C,P3> but one of the disadvantages and i always throw this out is that if your students (%hesitation%) aren't careful enough they could end up falling behind with their let's say scheme of work homework assignments and so on
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 49.94 57.50 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you'd better have a word with them in the very beginning uh huh and tell them the importance of of doing things right
SI114J-00345-P30017 1 SI114J-00345 57.50 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my own opinion i think this is a perfect
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 3.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now teachers welcome to this presentation on acid rain
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 3.79 14.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now i think everybody knows a couple of facts about (%hesitation%) the acid rain itself but i'll try to go let's say in depth in order for you to understand a little bit more
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 14.65 20.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now i think everybody agrees with me when i say that factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 20.74 26.05 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but did you know that afterwards these acid particles turn into smoke
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 26.05 32.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and two things could happen when these acid particles are let's say transported by wind
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 32.81 40.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first one is that some of these acid particles (%hesitation%) could be seen falling from the sky but i wouldn't worry about that
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 40.73 51.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> what i would worry about however is when the those acid particles mix with cloud water because when it rains it's what this rain contains that can cause some sort of skin ger skin rash on your skin
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 51.92 56.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and what's even worse it can damage the environment which is my today's topic
SI114J-00345-P40018 1 SI114J-00345 56.34 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now i hope you have brought (%hesitation%) a notebook because you'll be
SI114J-00345-P50019 1 SI114J-00345 0.00 5.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> now people welcome to this little presentation on healthier lifestyles
SI114J-00345-P50019 1 SI114J-00345 5.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> now (%hesitation%) regarding any habits i would say that you really want to lose weight the way i did my first recommendation is that you better cut out certain types of fried ups for example hamburgers hotdogs pancakes fries

SI114J-00354-P30017 1 SI114J-00354 0.00 24.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> okay if you are questioning me about if all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies i have to say that the main advantage (%hesitation%) of that will be that they will work with professionals in their industry and probably that students will grow up
SI114J-00354-P30017 1 SI114J-00354 24.32 34.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand they will spend too much time too much time working and probably the amount of stress will be important
SI114J-00354-P30017 1 SI114J-00354 34.48 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) students shouldn't do get jobs to pay their university studies and they should be focused on their own studies

SI114J-00354-P50019 1 SI114J-00354 10.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example (%hesitation%) it's a wonderful way to to have an easy access to information
SI114J-00354-P50020 1 SI114J-00354 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i consider face to face learning burning the (%hesitation%) better than online learning because you'll be able to concentrate harder on your learning with less distraction that if you are stay in home

SI114J-00356-P50019 1 SI114J-00356 10.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example for improving their english they could be a good idea using this program
SI114J-00356-P50020 1 SI114J-00356 0.00 10.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i am totally agree with this information because in this way the students can share their doubts or questions with a teacher
SI114J-00356-P50020 1 SI114J-00356 10.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and of course the teachers can solve those doubts or questions and teach in a good way

SI114J-00356-P50022 1 SI114J-00356 0.00 10.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it isn't because i think it's better to read alone

SI114J-00357-P30017 1 SI114J-00357 0.00 16.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> about the practical work experience it is could be said that it's advantage because the student will have a previous (%hesitation%) experience

SI114J-00357-P40018 1 SI114J-00357 35.46 48.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and how i see it (%hesitation%) this app never worked well because it's well it's it was working in the four or five days
SI114J-00357-P40018 1 SI114J-00357 48.30 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and nevertheless music now (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it could be said it start with strength and the end (%hesitation%) failed (%hesitation%)

SI114J-00357-P50020 1 SI114J-00357 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the problem is that in the end they (%hesitation%) have known (%hesitation%) to each other and the ideas could be sock sock in in the future because they don't have enough

SI114J-00357-P50022 1 SI114J-00357 0.00 5.35 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the best way to communicate is face to face

SI114J-00357-P50023 1 SI114J-00357 0.00 12.75 <o,Q4,B1,P5> that is exactly i have see it how i see it (%hesitation%) because i know you need to be concentrate a specific (%hesitation%) task
SI114J-00357-P50023 1 SI114J-00357 12.75 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) however if you want more result you need more ideas or a a a brainstorm
SI114J-00367-P10005 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 13.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the favourite time of year for me is spring festival because on that day i have the opportunity to stay with my grandparents and play with my cousins
SI114J-00367-P10005 1 SI114J-00367 13.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy spending times with them and staying up late for the new year
SI114J-00367-P10006 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well it has already been a necessity for me to listen or to read about news because reading or listening about news help help me to know what had happened recently in the world and it could broaden my horizon as well
SI114J-00367-P10007 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 7.54 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i was a child i usually spent my free times watching cartoons on (sit-) on the tv
SI114J-00367-P10007 1 SI114J-00367 7.54 14.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> also i would sometimes invite some friends of mine to come to my house and play toys with them
SI114J-00367-P10007 1 SI114J-00367 14.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy those happy moments i have spent when i was young
SI114J-00367-P10008 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 3.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to be a composer in the future
SI114J-00367-P10008 1 SI114J-00367 3.62 10.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> recently i have been learning to compose and i found it entertaining and interesting
SI114J-00367-P10008 1 SI114J-00367 10.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it is a good thing for me to makes turn this hobby into a job in a future and enjoy it as well
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 9.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> my opinion i support the idea that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 9.87 25.54 <o,Q4,C,P3> as a university students who are going to (s-) (ch-) skip into the society it is important for them to learn about practical work experience
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 25.54 31.28 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this could enrich their social experiences
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 31.28 38.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> employers would more likely to admit those who had enough social experiences
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 38.75 44.36 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this would help them help them find works in the future
SI114J-00367-P30017 1 SI114J-00367 44.36 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> although studying such courses would be a distraction of their studies i still think it a really genius idea to include a period of practical work experience
SI114J-00367-P40018 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 31.53 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the amount of visitors who (whi-) who (vi-) which visited the site music now has been rising for the first three days and then it has a (fluc-) fluctuated patterns for the following two days and then it gradually falls from the fifth day to the seventh day from one an amount of one hundred thousands of people to eighty thousands of people
SI114J-00367-P40018 1 SI114J-00367 31.53 45.99 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and for the site songs four you in general the numbers of visitors has been decreasing from (fif-) about fifty five thousands of people to only eighteen thousands of people
SI114J-00367-P40018 1 SI114J-00367 45.99 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at last for the site tunes net the numbers of visitors rises gradually in the (f-) first fifth day and then rises rapidly and turns
SI114J-00367-P50019 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 4.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think a good team leader should be rich in leadership
SI114J-00367-P50019 1 SI114J-00367 4.63 11.86 <o,Q4,C,P5> he should be determined to make decisions and he should let all the team members listen to him
SI114J-00367-P50019 1 SI114J-00367 11.86 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> he should have the power to control the whole team and to lead them forward
SI114J-00367-P50020 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 5.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> there could be different points of views from different members
SI114J-00367-P50020 1 SI114J-00367 5.30 9.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> and sometimes they would argue with each other
SI114J-00367-P50020 1 SI114J-00367 9.79 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> to solve these problems all we need is cooperations and communication
SI114J-00367-P50021 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes because disagreeing with each other can expand more points of views to the project they are doing
SI114J-00367-P50021 1 SI114J-00367 10.59 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it can provide more useful suggestions
SI114J-00367-P50022 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 2.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> not really
SI114J-00367-P50022 1 SI114J-00367 2.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> since social media is developing fastly nowadays online (%hesitation%) conversations could be as well (a-) also efficiently as well as the face to face conversations
SI114J-00367-P50023 1 SI114J-00367 0.00 2.58 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it depends
SI114J-00367-P50023 1 SI114J-00367 2.58 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> because teams working together may the the members of them may argue with each other while person a person who works alone could do what he want and make it efficient
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 11.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> yes (%hesitation%) i think the schools and college should make time to the school day for all the students to do fitness class
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 11.12 18.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages are that they can make a sport (%hesitation%) where they are studying so they always have time
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 18.50 32.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) maybe some people have to work and cannot move the courses so for them it's not (%hesitation%) possible to attend the fitness classes
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 32.99 36.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion i think it's a good idea
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 36.35 39.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i would like to have this in my college
SI114J-00379-P30017 1 SI114J-00379 39.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for sure i will go to all the fitness classes as it's possible because i love to do sport and sometimes i'm not able to get to the fitness studio because i am too late for the classes
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 6.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello i will explain how honey is produced from flowers to shop
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 6.88 11.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all bees should collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 11.59 20.61 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after they fly to the hive where they make honey from nectar in the beehive
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 20.61 27.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when everything is full the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 27.30 36.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they can get more or less (%hesitation%) about ten litres honey from every beehive
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 36.22 43.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the last step is to put the honey in jars
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 43.63 46.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they should be like half kilo and one kilo
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 46.54 50.64 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they are the usually measures for the honey jars
SI114J-00379-P40018 1 SI114J-00379 50.64 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then after they are transported to the
SI114J-00379-P50019 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the two most important things that a student face when he moves to a new country one side is to choose a good (%hesitation%) study program and the other thing is to find a good residence
SI114J-00379-P50020 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 16.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think one of the bigger advantage advantage advantage to study in a second language is that you can improve your skills in that language and also that you are developing all different areas in your brain

SI114J-00379-P50021 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think one of the difficults that (%hesitation%) a student (%hesitation%) can find when they move to another country is (%hesitation%) to understand the new language and also to make new friends
SI114J-00379-P50022 1 SI114J-00379 0.00 11.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way to (%hesitation%) to learn about local culture is to speak with locals with the people that is living in the place you are moving in

SI114J-00382-P10007 1 SI114J-00382 8.02 16.56 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we have the same humour the same (%hesitation%) the same rage sometimes the same (%hesitation%) level of (%hesitation%) humour
SI114J-00382-P10007 1 SI114J-00382 16.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so you we are very alike
SI114J-00382-P10008 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 13.48 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in the future i would like to live in the u k or in the united states because i think (thi-) (%hesitation%) this countries will (impr-) will improve my (%hesitation%) veterinarian in small animal medicine skills
SI114J-00382-P10008 1 SI114J-00382 13.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think they are the best (%hesitation%) countries for me
SI114J-00382-P30017 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 16.75 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i think that (%hesitation%) students (%hesitation%) doing fitness is a very (%hesitation%) well (%hesitation%) structure (%hesitation%) plan (%hesitation%) to help them to improve their mood in the day and to make them stay in shape
SI114J-00382-P30017 1 SI114J-00382 16.75 28.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think it's a very good idea (%hesitation%) for all the students that they don't have don't have time in in other (%hesitation%) part of the day to do some exercise
SI114J-00382-P30017 1 SI114J-00382 28.59 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think that will improve their (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) their notes and their scores and it's it's going to be (%hesitation%) healthier (%hesitation%) for them and for her their lives
SI114J-00382-P40018 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 5.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) well first the bees make it honey from nectar
SI114J-00382-P40018 1 SI114J-00382 5.12 13.49 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and then (%hesitation%) the people is charge like a bek bay beekeeper collect the honey from beehives
SI114J-00382-P40018 1 SI114J-00382 13.49 17.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) they he put it in a in a jar
SI114J-00382-P40018 1 SI114J-00382 17.57 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) a truck (%hesitation%) carries the the (%hesitation%) the the honey to a store and then the store sell it to the people
SI114J-00382-P50019 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the most important thing is to see the quality of life that this city of this country (%hesitation%) offers to the student and to learn about the university (%hesitation%) that the student is going to attend
SI114J-00382-P50020 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the most important things to learn another (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) language is that you can study in the language country and you can improve (%hesitation%) your skills and be more (%hesitation%) prepared for for the future
SI114J-00382-P50021 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can face (%hesitation%) barriers like (%hesitation%) cultural barriers or immigrant barriers and (%hesitation%) perhaps (%hesitation%) the people is not very friendly with you
SI114J-00382-P50022 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you could make some friends you could go to the public library in the town and you could just like (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) do a little research to know how the things in this town or this city are doing
SI114J-00382-P50023 1 SI114J-00382 0.00 7.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm totally agree because if you study abroad (%hesitation%) you have to learn to do the things by yourself
SI114J-00382-P50023 1 SI114J-00382 7.83 14.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (noth-) no one near you is going to help and you don't have your family or your friends so you are alone
SI114J-00382-P50023 1 SI114J-00382 14.24 14.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you
SI114J-00382-P50023 1 SI114J-00382 14.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) you will grow a lot if you study abroad
SI114J-00384-P10005 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 4.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00384-P10005 1 SI114J-00384 4.61 8.33 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's amazing to know about culture and history
SI114J-00384-P10005 1 SI114J-00384 8.33 16.03 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's fabulous how people can interact from each other how they can communicate their feelings differently
SI114J-00384-P10005 1 SI114J-00384 16.03 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> slangs vocabulary expressions they are so
SI114J-00384-P10006 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 6.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending time by my free time by watching tv or series
SI114J-00384-P10006 1 SI114J-00384 6.88 11.16 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really like reading and singng as well
SI114J-00384-P10006 1 SI114J-00384 11.16 16.11 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love reading science fiction for example
SI114J-00384-P10006 1 SI114J-00384 16.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i am really fond of doing sport
SI114J-00384-P10007 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 8.97 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way for me to improve my english is by using speak and improve and by using write and improve
SI114J-00384-P10007 1 SI114J-00384 8.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i also use cambridge dictionary to look up the words i don't know and to be able to understand complex texts and ideas
SI114J-00384-P10008 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 14.74 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would really like to gain the skill of being able to understand all writings of being able to to use the words i learn in every of my speakings
SI114J-00384-P10008 1 SI114J-00384 14.74 18.99 <o,Q5,B2,P1> thus i would become an advanced speaker
SI114J-00384-P10008 1 SI114J-00384 18.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and that's
SI114J-00384-P30017 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 17.85 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages of doing part time job as studying are that you can gain a lot of experience you can learn a lot about real life about (re-) the work reality
SI114J-00384-P30017 1 SI114J-00384 17.85 35.13 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you can engage with the job you can make friends you can think about what are the aspects what are what is the kind of job that you like
SI114J-00384-P30017 1 SI114J-00384 35.13 47.27 <o,Q5,B2,P3> however the advantages are that if you are studying maybe you won't have much time to to relate with that job
SI114J-00384-P30017 1 SI114J-00384 47.27 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you have to think about ways to get a balance between the job and the study
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 5.17 <o,Q4,B2,P4> everything starts with factories
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 5.17 9.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> factories are from the businesses
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 9.73 32.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we might blame the businesses and their factories to the pollution that we live currently because factories make up these pollution because of the acid particles that are in the smoke they let free
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 32.74 38.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by wind
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 38.14 48.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they are spilled over the place close to those factories
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 48.63 53.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid particles fall as dust
SI114J-00384-P40018 1 SI114J-00384 53.42 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they damage the (environme-)
SI114J-00384-P50019 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 8.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to eat a variety of food such as salad meat fruit and vegetables

SI114J-00384-P50019 1 SI114J-00384 12.00 17.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example the lack in certain vitamins might cause a problem in your health
SI114J-00384-P50019 1 SI114J-00384 17.94 20.78 <o,Q5,B2,P5> when planning meals you should think about
SI114J-00384-P50020 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 4.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's extremely important to drink water
SI114J-00384-P50020 1 SI114J-00384 4.84 13.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you did you know that (th-) we are made with (%hesitation%) seventy percent of water
SI114J-00384-P50020 1 SI114J-00384 13.79 19.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> without it we can't doing our daily activities
SI114J-00384-P50020 1 SI114J-00384 19.02 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we can't
SI114J-00384-P50021 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 17.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's essential doing exercise maybe not necessarily every day but at least twice a week because you need to do exercise to step up from your bed not to be quiet or still all day
SI114J-00384-P50021 1 SI114J-00384 17.77 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you need to work out
SI114J-00384-P50022 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 7.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think sleeping is crucial in our health
SI114J-00384-P50022 1 SI114J-00384 7.44 17.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if we don't sleep at least eight hours per night it can be really harmful for our health
SI114J-00384-P50022 1 SI114J-00384 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we need to take a rest
SI114J-00384-P50023 1 SI114J-00384 0.00 14.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology has had a negative effect in people's life because they spend more time as watching the screen than writing or than than working out
SI114J-00384-P50023 1 SI114J-00384 14.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they are not focused in developing that skill
SI114J-00396-P30017 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 6.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> i try to explain about jobs for university payment
SI114J-00396-P30017 1 SI114J-00396 6.92 17.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> at first merit of part time job is a opportunity for students to get to know society
SI114J-00396-P30017 1 SI114J-00396 17.95 20.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> next drawbacks of it
SI114J-00396-P30017 1 SI114J-00396 20.74 25.07 <o,Q5,C,P3> it's that job will reduce their study time
SI114J-00396-P30017 1 SI114J-00396 25.07 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> at last in my opinion it would be beneficial for students to consider the job they would like to get in the future
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 7.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> please see the picture about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 7.31 13.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now i'd like to explain how to go through to travel by airplane
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 13.91 23.71 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at first you have to travel to airport by car or bus or train
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 23.71 32.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and next when you arrive airport you have to check in the counter
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 32.23 40.16 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then you have to show passport document control
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 40.16 45.68 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and next you should (%hesitation%) security
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 45.68 50.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you can wait in airport lounge
SI114J-00396-P40018 1 SI114J-00396 50.03 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> finally you can board airplane and it will departure
SI114J-00396-P50019 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can use information technology for example internet or public domain source information for their specialised field
SI114J-00396-P50020 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 12.32 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion to learn something mutual understanding will be effective than studying alone
SI114J-00396-P50020 1 SI114J-00396 12.32 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree with the idea
SI114J-00396-P50021 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 5.42 <o,Q5,C,P5> in that case depend on the situation
SI114J-00396-P50021 1 SI114J-00396 5.42 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can will get experience and knowledge and they will develop their collaboration and the communication skills
SI114J-00396-P50022 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 3.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes i think so
SI114J-00396-P50022 1 SI114J-00396 3.86 11.18 <o,Q5,C,P5> attending lecture will conversation will give them more information
SI114J-00396-P50022 1 SI114J-00396 11.18 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but sometimes reading alone would give them concentration and deep soul
SI114J-00396-P50023 1 SI114J-00396 0.00 12.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the most important things for university must be high quality research and education
SI114J-00396-P50023 1 SI114J-00396 12.04 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 10.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> all right guys so let me tell you my point of view on practical work experience (%hesitation%) for students when they are at university
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 10.05 23.68 <o,Q5,B2,P3> now some of the advantages that i can find by doing this is that students can acquire meaningful experience and they can also learn how to use the this experience at their workplaces
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 23.68 30.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so for instance (%hesitation%) in my end (%hesitation%) i was about to send one of my students to a company
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 30.62 43.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if this person could acquire the experience (%hesitation%) i need (%hesitation%) that would be meaningful for me because i would say okay i'm doing my job (re-) really really well
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 43.72 57.79 <o,Q5,B2,P3> however one of the disadvantages is that students can (s-) become dropouts because they're gonna start any money they're gonna say ah you know what i don't need (%hesitation%) university anymore i'm just going to focus on my job
SI114J-00402-P30017 1 SI114J-00402 57.79 60.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) finally i think
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 7.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> all right guys welcome to this presentation on visits visits to three online pop music sites
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 7.46 15.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now the first thing you need to take into account is that we're gonna focus on tunes net music now and songs four you
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 15.41 32.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now (%hesitation%) i need to point out that (%hesitation%) even though music now started as the strongest and toughest company for music (%hesitation%) they ended up being on (%hesitation%) coming in second place
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 32.77 38.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that's why you shouldn't trust the first company you see
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 38.07 41.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you always need to see figures like these ones
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 41.12 58.06 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now regarding tunes net (%hesitation%) they they started pretty bad but eventually (%hesitation%) their increase was smoothly and by by day number five their increase was sharply
SI114J-00402-P40018 1 SI114J-00402 58.06 60.21 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and they bumped up
SI114J-00402-P50019 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think a good team leader is a person who is caring (%hesitation%) it's open minded when it comes to receive new ideas and give ideas
SI114J-00402-P50019 1 SI114J-00402 12.18 16.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however it is also really important to see the time management
SI114J-00402-P50019 1 SI114J-00402 16.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you need to be good at (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00402-P50020 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 4.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well first and foremost is the lack of ideas
SI114J-00402-P50020 1 SI114J-00402 4.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if you are not if you don't have a huge team we can say but i'm just saying like (%hesitation%) like a team of ten thousand people overall is a good team i can say (%hesitation%) you can no longer see the big
SI114J-00402-P50021 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 1.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it depends on the idea
SI114J-00402-P50021 1 SI114J-00402 1.71 11.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean if if i don't know sixty percent of the group (s-) (%hesitation%) says that it's not worth it i think it's a good idea to disagree
SI114J-00402-P50021 1 SI114J-00402 11.48 14.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> nevertheless you need to do in a polite way
SI114J-00402-P50021 1 SI114J-00402 14.22 19.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> otherwise i think will be quite rude and you can end up having problems
SI114J-00402-P50021 1 SI114J-00402 19.05 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that's
SI114J-00402-P50022 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 1.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not really
SI114J-00402-P50022 1 SI114J-00402 1.02 14.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you know technology has improved to a level in which now we can have (%hesitation%) online conversations by using skype or hotmail or even facetime if you own iphone stuff

SI114J-00402-P50023 1 SI114J-00402 0.00 6.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> let me tell you that the answer of this question relies on the kind of person we're talking about
SI114J-00402-P50023 1 SI114J-00402 6.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for instance if we're talking about someone who is shy and doesn't want to share ideas with other people and just want to focus on him or herself i think
SI114J-00405-P30017 1 SI114J-00405 0.00 25.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that all the university courses should include a period of pla practical work experience because in the advantages you are going to be more prepared when you graduate for the future and for and you are going to know what you want to do in your life
SI114J-00405-P30017 1 SI114J-00405 25.34 30.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you are going to know about the work and the money
SI114J-00405-P30017 1 SI114J-00405 30.20 39.16 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantages are that maybe you're not going to have a lot of time for you and for your friends and family
SI114J-00405-P30017 1 SI114J-00405 39.16 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion it's a good idea to take them and to have them because you are going to have more experience and maybe a better curriculum if you include a period of practical work
SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 0.00 6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in this graph you can see three new online pop music sites

SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 13.97 25.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the black one is music now that you can see that it elevates a lot from the third and five day but it returns to the same point
SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 25.09 31.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the tune net that it's the red start to very low but it increase a lot
SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 31.82 43.85 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the songs four you this decreased a lot and it's the lowest one at the end of the week
SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 43.85 46.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the best one was tune net
SI114J-00405-P40018 1 SI114J-00405 46.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it is the one that maybe the persons like the most so it's one of the online music site more visited right now and the best one for you to use it

SI114J-00412-P10006 1 SI114J-00412 9.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so every day you should read the newspaper or watch the news tv for example

SI114J-00412-P30017 1 SI114J-00412 0.00 20.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> many (s-) university courses include a period of practical work experience and it is very good because on the one hand you should (%hesitation%) do job and to to have experience of that

SI114J-00412-P30017 1 SI114J-00412 30.88 37.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you have to do a job without (%hesitation%) without pay without cost

SI114J-00412-P40018 1 SI114J-00412 20.85 34.57 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but in the four and five days there are a big increase until (%hesitation%) ten thousand until one hundred thousand people
SI114J-00412-P40018 1 SI114J-00412 34.57 48.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the case of songs four you there are over forty or sixty thousand of people and there are a increase

SI114J-00412-P50019 1 SI114J-00412 0.00 11.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the skills that it's very important to have a team leader is to be very responsible
SI114J-00412-P50019 1 SI114J-00412 11.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because if you are not responsible (%hesitation%) follow (th-)

SI114J-00412-P50020 1 SI114J-00412 14.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think is good to try to to work

SI114J-00412-P50022 1 SI114J-00412 0.00 12.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think it's so important to be face to face to talk to explain to to treat or something like that
SI114J-00412-P50022 1 SI114J-00412 12.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think it's very important that's (%hesitation%) a a good team
SI114J-00412-P50023 1 SI114J-00412 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think (%hesitation%) the result are better if you work with other people than alone because one head think less than four head
SI114J-00413-P10005 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm really interested in about learning about other countries (%hesitation%) specifically ireland because i really th i really think it's a really interesting country with tradition costumes food and people very cheerful
SI114J-00413-P10006 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my free time i like to play football exercise my body work out at gym reading books visit (%hesitation%) theatres museums (%hesitation%) travel to other countries and hang out with my friends
SI114J-00413-P10007 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 13.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that my the best way for improve my level of english is basically checking some specific course or official exams
SI114J-00413-P10007 1 SI114J-00413 13.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> also reading books and practice (%hesitation%) speaking with people
SI114J-00413-P10008 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it would be the piano to know how to play the piano to learn about it because i really like music and specifically classic music
SI114J-00413-P10008 1 SI114J-00413 12.77 16.57 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and the sounds of the piano i think it is just beautiful
SI114J-00413-P10008 1 SI114J-00413 16.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and it's a really good skill
SI114J-00413-P30017 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 17.97 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantage is like they gain some experience during these part time jobs that is absolutely essential (%hesitation%) for the future so they can (%hesitation%) enrich itself
SI114J-00413-P30017 1 SI114J-00413 17.97 28.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and also (%hesitation%) another advantage is that they will have some extra money that it they could spend in whatever they want
SI114J-00413-P30017 1 SI114J-00413 28.50 29.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so
SI114J-00413-P30017 1 SI114J-00413 29.41 52.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) they also they (%hesitation%) establish some new connections (%hesitation%) in this labour market for the future for the future because they maybe could get (%hesitation%) a full job in the in the place that they they were working during his university studies
SI114J-00413-P30017 1 SI114J-00413 52.13 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think that they this is they are the main advantages of the part time job while they are studying
SI114J-00413-P40018 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 13.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i have been asked to give a presentation about acid rain and i'm going to take into account the information that shows this diagram (%hesitation%) that contains information about the formation and effects of (as-) acid rain
SI114J-00413-P40018 1 SI114J-00413 13.70 20.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) expulse some (%hesitation%) pollutions and emissions to the air
SI114J-00413-P40018 1 SI114J-00413 20.84 28.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so these acid particles are in the smoke and these arcid (par-) and these acid particles are carried by the wind through the air
SI114J-00413-P40018 1 SI114J-00413 28.41 34.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some of these acid particles fall as dust but others acid particles mix with cloud water
SI114J-00413-P40018 1 SI114J-00413 34.67 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then when it rains or snow (%hesitation%) they they go to the ground and affects to all (%hesitation%) all the environment damaging it and (%hesitation%) and having a really bad impact in our lives
SI114J-00413-P50019 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 10.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> my advice for people that want to develop good eating habits is that they have to be concerned about the importance of this matter
SI114J-00413-P50019 1 SI114J-00413 10.16 18.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they need to have a (%hesitation%) great variety of food at his home
SI114J-00413-P50019 1 SI114J-00413 18.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it's very important
SI114J-00413-P50020 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 15.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's absolutely important to drink lots of water during day because the human body needs to be hydrated and the human body it's almost more than a half of simply water
SI114J-00413-P50020 1 SI114J-00413 15.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's absolutely necessary for you to drink a lot of water
SI114J-00413-P50021 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 18.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i really think that it is essential to do some exercise every day because it affects to firstly to your health that is more important but also you will have some fun and diminish your level of stress
SI114J-00413-P50021 1 SI114J-00413 18.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's really important
SI114J-00413-P50022 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 7.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that because it's really important to sleep at least eight hours day
SI114J-00413-P50022 1 SI114J-00413 7.86 15.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you could sleep few hours more but it's really important because your your body needs to rest
SI114J-00413-P50022 1 SI114J-00413 15.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and all the energy that you spend day before it should be recovered
SI114J-00413-P50023 1 SI114J-00413 0.00 18.65 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology have a really good effect on people's health because it can help you to reach new goals to controlled (%hesitation%) your level of sugar your blood pressure and a lot of things that are really important for your health
SI114J-00413-P50023 1 SI114J-00413 18.65 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it is

SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 0.00 5.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in this presentation i will explain how honey is produced
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 5.09 11.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first and essential thing is that the bees collect the nectar from the flowers
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 11.27 21.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then they go inside the hive in the shape of a box where the bees produce the honey with the nectar from the flowers
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 21.96 36.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> later beekeepers collect the honey from the hives and bottle it for distribution and transporters take it to the shop so that consumers can buy it
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 36.91 49.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the function of bee is very important on our planet because apart from providing honey they pollinate flowers and this make us have flowers
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 49.23 53.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> life without bees will be a global disaster
SI114J-00422-P40018 1 SI114J-00422 53.74 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> for example now our planet they have to
SI114J-00422-P50019 1 SI114J-00422 0.00 17.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the choice of a country is fundamental since depending on what we want to study (%hesitation%) we (wan-) we'll have to choose one country or another that will provide us with what we need
SI114J-00422-P50019 1 SI114J-00422 17.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in addition we must
SI114J-00422-P50020 1 SI114J-00422 0.00 8.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the advantage of studying a second language is that we can communicate with other people
SI114J-00422-P50020 1 SI114J-00422 8.23 17.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because if we want to live in any other city in the world the language cannot be an impediment
SI114J-00422-P50020 1 SI114J-00422 17.52 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it's essential
SI114J-00422-P50021 1 SI114J-00422 0.00 7.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the studying in another country must be complicate at first in time

SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 0.00 2.16 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i'm not sure
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 2.16 4.94 <o,Q5,B2,P3> there are different points of view
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 4.94 23.42 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the one hand we can think that is a good way to for for them for for consider how hard is a job (%hesitation%) and and help to earn the money to pay their their studies their studies
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 23.42 32.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but on the other hand we can think that if they have (%hesitation%) a job they have less time to to (s-) to study
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 32.66 35.10 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and it's their money
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 35.10 40.42 <o,Q5,B2,P3> they can spend in different things and and have less time to study
SI114J-00433-P30017 1 SI114J-00433 40.42 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in general in my opinion i think is a good way for for them to grow up and be more mature in the future (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) better better persons
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 0.00 7.01 <o,Q5,C,P4> according to the picture firstly you have to do is going to the airport
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 7.01 11.66 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can go by car by bus or by train
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 11.66 21.25 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you you arrive to the airport and the first thing you have to do there is check in (%hesitation%) check in your your bag
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 21.25 21.99 <o,Q5,C,P4> eh
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 21.99 33.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after that you have to go to the office to and show your document control (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to a security man
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 33.38 37.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) he check your your your bag
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 37.62 40.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you have to wait to boarding
SI114J-00433-P40018 1 SI114J-00433 40.68 48.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> you maybe (c-) you can go to toilet or eat something (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) while you are waiting

SI114J-00433-P50019 1 SI114J-00433 0.00 4.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's a good way to have more information
SI114J-00433-P50019 1 SI114J-00433 4.84 13.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can you can check out on the website or reading different articles on the website
SI114J-00433-P50019 1 SI114J-00433 13.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it's a good it's a good way to have more information
SI114J-00433-P50020 1 SI114J-00433 0.00 15.87 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i'm i'm not sure maybe it have some advantage for example when you when you are with other with other person you can you can you have more more information about it
SI114J-00433-P50020 1 SI114J-00433 15.87 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but not not is not always is the best
SI114J-00433-P50021 1 SI114J-00433 0.00 3.57 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's a good way of learning

SI114J-00439-P30017 1 SI114J-00439 19.55 24.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but if you are working and studying at the same time you won't be able to have time for you
SI114J-00439-P30017 1 SI114J-00439 24.28 27.27 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and you wanna study as good as you like
SI114J-00439-P30017 1 SI114J-00439 27.27 32.67 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion is not better to do one of the things because you can end up stressed
SI114J-00439-P30017 1 SI114J-00439 32.67 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00439-P50019 1 SI114J-00439 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i would like to say to the people who wants do eating habits that (%hesitation%) he if he if he if they do it they they they will feel very good with with they because it's a very good idea
SI114J-00439-P50020 1 SI114J-00439 0.00 15.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) is drink water is the most important things to to have (%hesitation%) a healthy life because the water clean your your yourself and your worry and your health
SI114J-00439-P50020 1 SI114J-00439 15.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's important to to drink water because it's a way to
SI114J-00439-P50021 1 SI114J-00439 0.00 10.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it isn't essential to do exercise every day but yes (%hesitation%) to do it (%hesitation%) maybe twice a week or something like this
SI114J-00439-P50021 1 SI114J-00439 10.83 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but we have to do some exercise on the week because it's very important to to to our bodies
SI114J-00439-P50022 1 SI114J-00439 0.00 11.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's very important to sleep (%hesitation%) a slee at least eight hours (%hesitation%) a day because we have to rest our ourselves
SI114J-00439-P50022 1 SI114J-00439 11.23 14.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and and we have to to
SI114J-00439-P50022 1 SI114J-00439 14.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and and if we (%hesitation%) sleep (%hesitation%) eight hours we feel better than if we
SI114J-00439-P50023 1 SI114J-00439 0.00 4.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are some advantages and disadvantages with technology
SI114J-00439-P50023 1 SI114J-00439 4.02 19.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) one of the advantages i can can see that (%hesitation%) can be that (%hesitation%) with technology we have many videos or or or things to to do to (mo-) for motivate us to do exercise
SI114J-00439-P50023 1 SI114J-00439 19.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and one of the
SI114J-00440-P10005 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 16.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> to make a long (%hesitation%) story short a study about other countries (%hesitation%) change say (%hesitation%) the mind of of people because it offer a different (%hesitation%) vision of other lifestyles
SI114J-00440-P10005 1 SI114J-00440 16.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i recommend travel in order to do it

SI114J-00440-P10006 1 SI114J-00440 9.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to go trekking (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) galicia is full of routes (%hesitation%) over the mountains
SI114J-00440-P10007 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 10.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> watching series and tv films (%hesitation%) in english and listen to music in english too
SI114J-00440-P10007 1 SI114J-00440 10.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i recommend people (%hesitation%) study the grammar (%hesitation%) doing lots of exercise and practice the writings and the speaking (ba-)
SI114J-00440-P10008 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 4.22 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it could be snorkelling because i love the sea
SI114J-00440-P10008 1 SI114J-00440 4.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i imagine myself (%hesitation%) doing snorkelling and (%hesitation%) having a different view of the underwater (%hesitation%) wildlife wildlife sea
SI114J-00440-P30017 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 4.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it has about some advantage and disadvantage
SI114J-00440-P30017 1 SI114J-00440 4.93 21.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example students who want to work in part time jobs want to earn some laboral experience and to acquire too (%hesitation%) transversal skills to their own (%hesitation%) studies
SI114J-00440-P30017 1 SI114J-00440 21.21 39.27 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) on the other hand (%hesitation%) students who want to to work in part time jobs (%hesitation%) must know that they probably (%hesitation%) would (li-) (%hesitation%) have (%hesitation%) less time to their studies
SI114J-00440-P30017 1 SI114J-00440 39.27 50.18 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i'm considering it positive on balance (%hesitation%) but i'm thinking that education must be free for everybody
SI114J-00440-P30017 1 SI114J-00440 50.18 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if the state pay the education students probably would enjoy more opportunities in the laboral market
SI114J-00440-P40018 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 13.95 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the graph shows how acid rain is (%hesitation%) produced (%hesitation%) because of (%hesitation%) activity of factories and vehicles
SI114J-00440-P40018 1 SI114J-00440 13.95 29.48 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in fact (%hesitation%) the pollution generated produce acid particles (%hesitation%) in smoke and it (%hesitation%) are probably carried by wind in the atmosphere
SI114J-00440-P40018 1 SI114J-00440 29.48 55.58 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) in the steps four and five i can see how some acid particles fall as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water (%hesitation%) reaction with other particles and falling to the grounds in form of acid particles of rain and snow damaging our environment
SI114J-00440-P40018 1 SI114J-00440 55.58 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in fact it probably cause (da-) damage to
SI114J-00440-P50019 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 6.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> recommend people eat lots of vegetables and fruit
SI114J-00440-P50019 1 SI114J-00440 6.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in fact i think the best diet is the mediterranean diet which includes (%hesitation%) most of these (%hesitation%) meals and lots of water
SI114J-00440-P50020 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 9.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> our body is (%hesitation%) in most part water so i'm consider drink water very important
SI114J-00440-P50020 1 SI114J-00440 9.24 16.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) but i'm not sure about (%hesitation%) if it's really important drinks lots of water
SI114J-00440-P50020 1 SI114J-00440 16.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's important drinks at least one
SI114J-00440-P50021 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> absolutely because doing exercise every day (%hesitation%) really leaves our mind clear of (%hesitation%) the stressful (%hesitation%) things and i consider it the best way to recover our essence
SI114J-00440-P50022 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 8.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) sleep is the best (%hesitation%) food of our body
SI114J-00440-P50022 1 SI114J-00440 8.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> what i want to mean is everybody must sleep at least eight (%hesitation%) hours per per day in order to recover (%hesitation%) and to rest their body
SI114J-00440-P50023 1 SI114J-00440 0.00 11.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> both because it depends (%hesitation%) of (%hesitation%) how people use technology in order to to sustain a healthy lifestyle
SI114J-00440-P50023 1 SI114J-00440 11.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if people use (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) tutorials of youtube for some kind of
SI114J-00445-P30017 1 SI114J-00445 0.00 17.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion this is a good idea because our students will be more likely to be hired by enterprises because these because these enterprises will these companies will know them before they graduate
SI114J-00445-P30017 1 SI114J-00445 17.56 40.45 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand the main disadvantage is that some students at the time they receive money they are more probably to leave the school and this is not this is not good (f-) for us because if we do not have students we will not get enough money to cover our expenses or outgoings
SI114J-00445-P30017 1 SI114J-00445 40.45 44.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00445-P30017 1 SI114J-00445 44.42 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but we need to make statistics to make sure our students will not leave will not leave school
SI114J-00445-P40018 1 SI114J-00445 0.00 1.37 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hey everyone

SI114J-00445-P40018 1 SI114J-00445 2.85 10.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i'm gonna explain the next line graph about visits to three new online pop music sites in seven days
SI114J-00445-P40018 1 SI114J-00445 10.74 34.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> firstly as you can appreciate music now line fluctuates over these days with two peaks in the third and fifth day (%hesitation%) whereas tunes net line goes (g-) goes up very quickly more specifically in the last three days when it when it went when it went up very sharply
SI114J-00445-P40018 1 SI114J-00445 34.80 45.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally songs for you fluctuates from the first to the fifth name and finally it plunged very very quickly
SI114J-00445-P40018 1 SI114J-00445 45.52 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i think tunes net took users from songs for you and music now because when tunes net (%hesitation%) increases the other platforms go down
SI114J-00450-P30017 1 SI114J-00450 0.00 15.32 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some people believe that all the students should have jobs to pay for their university students whereas i tend to think that they that it's their duty they focus on their studies and not in working or something like that
SI114J-00450-P30017 1 SI114J-00450 15.32 25.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the main advantage is if that they pay their own students they are going to feel more independent and this feeling is very is really worth it
SI114J-00450-P30017 1 SI114J-00450 25.93 43.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages is that you need for in order to gain money you need to work and you don't have enough time to study and get best as best as (be-) as well marks if you are not studying
SI114J-00450-P30017 1 SI114J-00450 43.86 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion the students need to focus on their studies and to later on working
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 0.00 7.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this diagram shows the steps people need to do through to travel by airplane
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 7.96 12.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all you needs to go to the airport
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 12.22 20.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you can go by bus by car or in whatever transport you have
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 20.44 25.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> to later on you arrive in the airport you need to check in

SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 34.75 44.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) later on you must to pass the document control show your passport and your d n i
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 44.77 48.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that there are a security control
SI114J-00450-P40018 1 SI114J-00450 48.30 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally you have to wait in an area where there are a lot of restaurants shops and many overprices product
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 0.00 2.87 <o,Q5,B2,P3> that's a very interesting topic to speak about
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 2.87 6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P3> all students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 6.53 11.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and there're advantages and disadvantages in this (%hesitation%) question
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 11.30 13.81 <o,Q5,B2,P3> first let's begin with the advantages
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 13.81 19.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> students who are doing a part time job when they are studying will be more independent
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 19.54 23.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> they will know how to (%hesitation%) manage their own budget
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 23.05 32.55 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and also they will be able to build their network which will be very interesting when they will be looking for a job after their study
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 32.55 35.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there are also disadvantages
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 35.20 43.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> to begin with some students doesn't have the maturity to be (%hesitation%) grown up enough and to be able to work because they are still young
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 43.52 51.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) also there are students who have some difficulty to find the right balance between their work time study time and freedom
SI114J-00452-P30017 1 SI114J-00452 51.22 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> to my views it (be-) it also depends on the attitude of (%hesitation%) students so it should not be mandatory mandatory
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 0.00 4.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> acid rain is a very interesting topic because it's not well known
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 4.46 6.38 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so let me tell you what is it
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 6.38 11.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> acid rains come from the pollution (%hesitation%) from the vehicles and factories
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 11.24 17.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this pollution is rising in the air and is transforming into acid particles that you can find in the smoke
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 17.72 20.64 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by wind
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 20.64 27.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then they will go hot at or as (%hesitation%) cloud or they will fall as dust on the ground
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 27.42 35.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the particules that are in the clouds (%hesitation%) will be very tiny but you can find it into the rain or the snow
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 35.00 45.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once all that particules and that acid particules comes to the ground either as (%hesitation%) dust or rain or snow it will damage to the environment
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 45.41 54.20 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) for example it will fall into the lake and it will (%hesitation%) kill some fish and it will (%hesitation%) damage a tree which can be very dangerous
SI114J-00452-P40018 1 SI114J-00452 54.20 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we need to be very careful with pollution because it comes back at us
SI114J-00453-P30017 1 SI114J-00453 0.00 25.21 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages of university students to do part time jobs would be that they get the chance to learn how to be responsible at work and they also (%hesitation%) could can save up money for their future
SI114J-00453-P30017 1 SI114J-00453 25.21 36.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantage would be that they have not the same time as they did before to dedicate to their studies
SI114J-00453-P30017 1 SI114J-00453 36.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but it's not really in my opinion it's really not a disadvantage because when you are grown up you will need to have even more responsibilities that you maybe could not manage at all
SI114J-00453-P40018 1 SI114J-00453 0.00 21.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> acid rain is a very dangerous problem that we have nowadays because the pollution released from factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) makes acid particles be in the smoke
SI114J-00453-P40018 1 SI114J-00453 21.88 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and that particles are carried by wind and some of them fall as dust to the atmosphere and other acid particles mix up with cloud water which cause that acid rain to be in like in a rain way or a (sn-) snow way and that causes great damage to the environment
SI114J-00455-P10005 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 2.73 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love listen music

SI114J-00455-P30017 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 24.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the principal advantages to study a foreign language to pass a university course are that you can improve your skills and the abilities to speaking and listening comprehension from the second language and are useful to understand the situation that the actual jobs are involved to the students
SI114J-00455-P30017 1 SI114J-00455 24.76 37.61 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00455-P30017 1 SI114J-00455 37.61 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion i think that all students needs to have this kind of process in order to level up your skills of grammatical english or any kind of language that they need to have to increase job opportunities to get you a (j-) a good job and increase your incomes in the economic way
SI114J-00455-P50019 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 9.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the best way to find international views is that you can search this information on social media or internet
SI114J-00455-P50019 1 SI114J-00455 9.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it depends of this kind of pages or blogs websites or still from the (%hesitation%) searching of good good materials of news international
SI114J-00455-P50020 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 8.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree but it's a bad notice because we cannot lose this traditional part of knowing this kind of information
SI114J-00455-P50020 1 SI114J-00455 8.52 18.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and for the other we have the new system of technologies that are useful to have the information by the websites and wifi connections
SI114J-00455-P50020 1 SI114J-00455 18.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's kind of good and bad
SI114J-00455-P50021 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 5.81 <o,Q5,B2,P5> just depends of the pages that you are that you are searching for
SI114J-00455-P50021 1 SI114J-00455 5.81 16.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but we have like these specialised blogs that you can search and they have information for a good (%hesitation%) reliable system
SI114J-00455-P50021 1 SI114J-00455 16.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think that it's a good way also too
SI114J-00455-P50022 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 10.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's a good idea to keep up with local news because it's around the information that it involves the place that you are living that you're living
SI114J-00455-P50022 1 SI114J-00455 10.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) to take care of the local news (in-) increase the probability that you are notice for what happen in your town or your
SI114J-00455-P50023 1 SI114J-00455 0.00 7.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that it's that there exists some bad news but it depend ha the importance we give to them
SI114J-00455-P50023 1 SI114J-00455 7.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) in that case the papers the people just need to have the will of searching to identify whether it's a bad or good new
SI114J-00456-P10005 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> maybe it's (%hesitation%) about (help-) (%hesitation%) it's about helping me to (%hesitation%) to work in abroad and also to (%hesitation%) to to meet (%hesitation%) others people (whe-) when they they didn't speak the same (%hesitation%) the same language as me
SI114J-00456-P10006 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 10.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm a very active person so i like doing some outdoor activities like swimming
SI114J-00456-P10006 1 SI114J-00456 10.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i (%hesitation%) travel with my i travelled with my friends (als-) (%hesitation%) too
SI114J-00456-P10007 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 12.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my opinion the best way (%hesitation%) of improving your english or other language it's about (%hesitation%) reading the newspaper or (%hesitation%) or something
SI114J-00456-P10007 1 SI114J-00456 12.94 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and also speak to other people who they can who they didn't speak other language
SI114J-00456-P10008 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 14.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i (%hesitation%) when i when i was (%hesitation%) young i wanted to be a pilot but (%hesitation%) but it it (inc-) it involves a lot of study and it's very expensive
SI114J-00456-P10008 1 SI114J-00456 14.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i'll (%hesitation%) i still (p-) i still program to take (%hesitation%) flying lessons
SI114J-00456-P30017 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 17.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> all university students should do part jobs while they are studying because there (ad-) the there are (s-) some advantages like to be more independent learn more and to be able to follow the course (%hesitation%) in classroom
SI114J-00456-P30017 1 SI114J-00456 17.99 32.44 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and for me the disadvantages it's when (%hesitation%) when they have when they have more (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) exercise and more more courses and more activities
SI114J-00456-P30017 1 SI114J-00456 32.44 43.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's (disad-) disadvantage because the the students is very saturated and can (%hesitation%) can't follow each can't follow each course
SI114J-00456-P30017 1 SI114J-00456 43.22 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion you should (%hesitation%) you should have you should give one exercise per course and not a lot of exercise because it's very difficult for students
SI114J-00456-P40018 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 6.53 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this diagram shows the formation and effects of acid rains
SI114J-00456-P40018 1 SI114J-00456 6.53 11.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> as you can see the vehicles and factories produce pollution

SI114J-00456-P40018 1 SI114J-00456 53.39 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) and in the final they damage to environment like
SI114J-00456-P50019 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion to have a healthy lifestyle lifestyle you should you should eat (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) legumes and fruits because it's very it's very nice for your health and (%hesitation%) and for your lifestyle

SI114J-00456-P50023 1 SI114J-00456 0.00 14.02 <o,Q4,B1,P5> for me if the person navigate in the internet on the internet long hour it's very it's negative for (%hesitation%) for her health for her health
SI114J-00456-P50023 1 SI114J-00456 14.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because the technology (ha-) the technology have their (%hesitation%)

SI114J-00460-P30017 1 SI114J-00460 0.00 22.17 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) the students should study at least one foreign language because they can get the advantages which when which when they get (we-) hired some company it's (ve-) useful for them

SI114J-00460-P30017 1 SI114J-00460 40.64 48.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> it's very (%hesitation%) bad time cruel for some student

SI114J-00460-P50019 1 SI114J-00460 0.00 10.05 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to use smartphone there are lots of international news apps and (%hesitation%) also we can catch up the news in the social media
SI114J-00460-P50019 1 SI114J-00460 10.05 15.70 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so if you have the smartphone you could catch up the international news very easily

SI114J-00463-P10005 1 SI114J-00463 11.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite music is the rap because i think rap music is very exciting
SI114J-00463-P10006 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 8.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interesting in travelling to different places because different places have different cultures different climates and different thought

SI114J-00463-P10006 1 SI114J-00463 15.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i am very interesting in travelling to different places
SI114J-00463-P10007 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 11.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i will choose the albert einstein because i think albert einstein have the (%hesitation%) (bri-) brilliant mind and remarkable theories

SI114J-00463-P10007 1 SI114J-00463 17.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> by the way i like his theories very much
SI114J-00463-P10008 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 9.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think (%hesitation%) speaking (eng-) studying english can help me a lot in the future because i want to go abroad in the future

SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 10.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> today let us talk about a topic about (%hesitation%) students should (st-) study at last at least one foreign language in order to pass their university courses
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 10.86 14.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are both advantages and disadvantages on this topic
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 14.49 17.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first let us talk about some advantages
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 17.49 23.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) students who study foreign languages can give them more chance than others
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 23.24 29.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 29.95 33.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but there are also some disadvantages
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 33.22 44.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) they it will learning foreign languages will deter their mind from their origin (%hesitation%) study goals (%hesitation%) like they will not have enough time for their homework
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 44.38 54.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion is students should stay at least one foreign languages but (%hesitation%) you should make it (%hesitation%) stay every day and less than two hours
SI114J-00463-P30017 1 SI114J-00463 54.23 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> that is a balance between your language studying and your origin studying
SI114J-00463-P50019 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 16.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think the best way for students to find out international news is use their laptop or (m-) or phones to check it in the on the (com-) on the internet because as everyone knows internet is very fast and make everything no boundary
SI114J-00463-P50019 1 SI114J-00463 16.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it is internet
SI114J-00463-P50020 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 11.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that true because the faster developments of the internet will make people can search for the news news they want only from the internet easily
SI114J-00463-P50020 1 SI114J-00463 11.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and the the speed of internet is far more quicker than newspaper so i think (%hesitation%) newspaper will go in the future
SI114J-00463-P50021 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 13.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion the social media isn't a reliable source of news because the editors on the social media will be allowed to choose just for more people to see it
SI114J-00463-P50021 1 SI114J-00463 13.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think is not actually true in the social media when you just think about it and decide
SI114J-00463-P50022 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 11.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is very important for us to know the local news because local news is very important in our neighbourhoods and for our city
SI114J-00463-P50022 1 SI114J-00463 11.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> can make the relationship (%hesitation%) between me and our and my neighbour neighbourhoods stronger
SI114J-00463-P50023 1 SI114J-00463 0.00 5.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes of course there are actually too many bad news in the media
SI114J-00463-P50023 1 SI114J-00463 5.16 15.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but what (%hesitation%) we need you do is just (%hesitation%) read the bad news and think why it happened and what should i do to (%hesitation%) avoid it and not happen
SI114J-00463-P50023 1 SI114J-00463 15.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that is i think that is the most important that we need to do after we see the bad news
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> okay let's explain how pollution cause the acid rain
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 4.88 10.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all our vehicles and factories make some air pollution
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 10.33 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and in the pollution there is a lots of acid particles
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 15.49 21.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and of this particles there is a tiny piece of acid and they're in smoke
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 21.07 32.29 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the acid particles are carried by window and and drew to the drew and spread anywhere
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 32.29 37.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some acid particles fall as dust and make some damage to the environment
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 37.92 44.19 <o,Q5,B2,P4> also other (par-) other acid particles were mixed with cloud water
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 44.19 47.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the cloud makes rain or snow
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 47.59 56.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and and these fall as fall as rain or snow and (aft-) then makes damage to the environment
SI114J-00477-P40018 1 SI114J-00477 56.34 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and that's the all steps (%hesitation%) how (po-)
SI114J-00480-P40018 1 SI114J-00480 0.00 16.13 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) there there are many reasons to cause (polluti-) pollution but the main one can be considered as the aid rain pollution which is caused by factory and vehicle (%hesitation%) production
SI114J-00480-P40018 1 SI114J-00480 16.13 34.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) smoke (%hesitation%) produced by factories could pollute the air and increases (%hesitation%) the the risk of polluting the lakes and the environmental of the agricultural environment
SI114J-00480-P40018 1 SI114J-00480 34.74 37.53 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) can be that
SI114J-00480-P40018 1 SI114J-00480 37.53 49.32 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) i mean the the smoke rises in the sky and get mixed with the with the clouds
SI114J-00480-P40018 1 SI114J-00480 49.32 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some of the (%hesitation%) these smoke falls down (%hesitation%) parts as dust in the in the lakes and some falls in

SI114J-00487-P30017 1 SI114J-00487 52.63 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion i think that they have to pay their student because i have

SI114J-00487-P50023 1 SI114J-00487 1.65 11.89 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because the modern learning is better (%hesitation%) the student (%hesitation%) because the new can generation (%hesitation%) always like doing new thing
SI114J-00487-P50023 1 SI114J-00487 11.89 17.12 <o,Q4,B1,P5> moreover teacher have to (%hesitation%) motivate with modern learning

SI114J-00488-P30017 1 SI114J-00488 0.00 28.13 <o,Q5,B1,P3> one of the advantages of (%hesitation%) working when you are studying it's like you will get experience and for the next stage when you finished your your your career you're having (%hesitation%) a better grade and you you will for next stage will will be easier to for to to have a work

SI114J-00490-P30017 1 SI114J-00490 8.07 18.83 <o,Q5,B2,P3> indeed they will earn their own money and prove that they could be more independent and organised and self confident at working and studying
SI114J-00490-P30017 1 SI114J-00490 18.83 23.57 <o,Q5,B2,P3> thus they will no longer depend on their parents

SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 0.00 7.48 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the following diagram shows the formation of acid rain and the effects of this
SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 7.48 15.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> acid rain is caused by the smoke from factories and vehicles which is the first step
SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 15.56 22.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> secondly smoke carries some acid particles and they are carried by the wind
SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 22.12 30.35 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but some of them fell as dust while others are mixed with cloud water
SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 30.35 37.54 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally these acid particles fell during the snow or the rain
SI114J-00490-P40018 1 SI114J-00490 37.54 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as a result we have acid rain damage of environment such as deforestation lack of oxygen water contamination and of course air pollution since that first step of of the formation
SI114J-00495-P10005 1 SI114J-00495 0.00 3.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i love so much the music

SI114J-00495-P10008 1 SI114J-00495 0.00 6.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think the english it's something that all the people (%hesitation%) have to to learn you know
SI114J-00495-P10008 1 SI114J-00495 6.72 12.01 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and you can get advantage from other people who doesn't know (%hesitation%) about other language
SI114J-00495-P10008 1 SI114J-00495 12.01 15.74 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and a lot of companies are looking with (%hesitation%) that kind of people
SI114J-00495-P10008 1 SI114J-00495 15.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also i i dunno if you know but of twenty percent of the world it know
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 0.00 5.50 <o,Q5,B2,P3> let's talk about all the students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 5.50 8.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think (%hesitation%) that is something great
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 8.59 22.57 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) you can get a lot of advantage and benefits (%hesitation%) if you know another foreign language because now (%hesitation%) if you travel to another country you have to speak in the in the language that they know
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 22.57 35.81 <o,Q5,B2,P3> or if the language that they (%hesitation%) speak it's very inusual (%hesitation%) you can (%hesitation%) communicate (%hesitation%) by the best (%hesitation%) or the main language of the world that it's english
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 35.81 42.27 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but then (%hesitation%) in your country you can find a lot of advantage you know
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 42.27 58.25 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example a lot of companies in mexico (%hesitation%) are looking for people with this kind of skills (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) well all depends on the area that you are going to work but if you are going to travel to another country you have to know (%hesitation%) minimal another language
SI114J-00495-P30017 1 SI114J-00495 58.25 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and that's (%hesitation%) the fact

SI114J-00495-P50019 1 SI114J-00495 4.61 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the best way to (%hesitation%) to search about international news it's in internet and you can find a lot of (%hesitation%) international news there
SI114J-00495-P50019 1 SI114J-00495 15.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also the social medias are very important to find a lot of international
SI114J-00495-P50020 1 SI114J-00495 0.00 10.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm agree because well a lot of people now can find the news the news in internet and that kind of things in social medias
SI114J-00495-P50020 1 SI114J-00495 10.48 18.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you only have to (%hesitation%) turn on your cell phone (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) go to google and find the things that you want
SI114J-00495-P50020 1 SI114J-00495 18.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it's more easy than the

SI114J-00495-P50021 1 SI114J-00495 1.09 14.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think you all depends on the people who is looking the (%hesitation%) the news because you can find a lot of fake news but also you can find (%hesitation%) a (corre-) a true news
SI114J-00495-P50021 1 SI114J-00495 14.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that's the thing you know you have to to have a criterial to know what things are
SI114J-00495-P50022 1 SI114J-00495 0.00 3.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my experience i think it's very important you know
SI114J-00495-P50022 1 SI114J-00495 3.50 8.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because you have to (%hesitation%) you have to know what happen around of you

SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 8.18 13.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well those advantages would be for example you start taking some responsibilities
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 13.52 14.79 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you're not a children anymore

SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 15.64 22.45 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so you should start (%hesitation%) knowing how much effort it takes to earn some money in order to pay for what you really want to do
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 22.45 26.79 <o,Q5,B2,P3> that first of all it should be the university your university studies
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 26.79 32.18 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) also (%hesitation%) they give you some some some
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 32.18 33.55 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (ho-) how would say it
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 33.55 36.95 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well it (m-) it was mostly all the advantages
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 36.95 46.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> disvantages maybe your schedule or your timetable didn't fit too much with your with your friends' schedule so you are not able to see them as as as much as you would like
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 46.82 53.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) also you maybe you're not able to study as much as you would like for an example the university
SI114J-00497-P30017 1 SI114J-00497 53.28 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my opinion is that it it's a great option because you should start taking some responsibility as you're not a kid
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 5.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well first of all you should get to the to the airport and how you do it
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 5.80 10.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it could be by bus by train taxi for example a cab or your own car
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 10.87 14.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once you are in the airport you must do the check in
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 14.02 37.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> lately you'll be going through some for example document controls in order that you are the person that booked that landing card and also you will go through some security in order that you don't you don't have with you some illegal (o-) objects that are not allowed to pass in a or you to have in in the airplane
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 37.44 50.20 <o,Q5,B2,P4> lately when you have also lately right after all that when when you have passed all the security and control documents you just have to wait until the the the pilot make the call
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 50.20 52.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then you will board to the plane
SI114J-00497-P40018 1 SI114J-00497 52.30 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and after all you just have to wait to to take off and and arrive to your destiny
SI114J-00497-P50019 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 4.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> there are many ways that you can use technology to study effectively
SI114J-00497-P50019 1 SI114J-00497 4.04 19.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> first of all for example if you are (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a person that (d-) do have a have have job a (par-) have part job maybe the technology allows you to see those topics of those classes that you couldn't assist to
SI114J-00497-P50019 1 SI114J-00497 19.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so it's really help
SI114J-00497-P50020 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well it really depends on the person because if you there are persons that they are not going to be focused if they don't have a teacher in front of them like saying please shut shut up like going making them be focused
SI114J-00497-P50020 1 SI114J-00497 14.77 18.47 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but there are some peoples that they are focused or are better at their homes
SI114J-00497-P50020 1 SI114J-00497 18.47 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it depends on the person
SI114J-00497-P50021 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 9.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well they learn a skill that the the people or that show someone would learn about these one about work in group projects
SI114J-00497-P50021 1 SI114J-00497 9.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> first of all this (%hesitation%) work with with other people work teamwork would say that it's really really important to our future job
SI114J-00497-P50022 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 2.78 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well it depends on the person
SI114J-00497-P50022 1 SI114J-00497 2.78 14.31 <o,Q5,B1,P5> another time as i told you there are some persons that they prefer to read alone and they understood all the things that they have read better than if if someone is speaking
SI114J-00497-P50022 1 SI114J-00497 14.31 18.84 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but there are others there are many other people that prefer that someone explain it
SI114J-00497-P50022 1 SI114J-00497 18.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and then they will
SI114J-00497-P50023 1 SI114J-00497 0.00 17.24 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well it's mandatory to the universities to to provide those learning facilities because you are there to to well to to understand all the topics or the the themes that are that you go through during all this time
SI114J-00497-P50023 1 SI114J-00497 17.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so you really need those learning facilities in order to
SI114J-00498-P10005 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 2.46 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am deeply interest in it
SI114J-00498-P10005 1 SI114J-00498 2.46 15.18 <o,Q5,B2,P1> you know every time that i have one second of free time i try to enjoy this music thing you know and i go to theatres and to concerts
SI114J-00498-P10005 1 SI114J-00498 15.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i walk about and ask everybody how they feel about this (mu-)
SI114J-00498-P10006 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 2.31 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy it a lot
SI114J-00498-P10006 1 SI114J-00498 2.31 15.74 <o,Q5,B2,P1> you know for me i i fancy travelling to another places and being around with different people (%hesitation%) getting to know the architecture of the country and the way of life
SI114J-00498-P10006 1 SI114J-00498 15.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i have already been into many places all around the world
SI114J-00498-P10007 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 14.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> whoa that's a really difficult question because i would like to meet too many but i would say i would like to meet (%hesitation%) robert redford
SI114J-00498-P10007 1 SI114J-00498 14.09 18.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think he's gorgeous and he's intelligent
SI114J-00498-P10007 1 SI114J-00498 18.42 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and for me it would be
SI114J-00498-P10008 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well it would raise my consciousness and my (a-) (auto-) (m-)
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> main advantages of this is that (%hesitation%) we are living in a global world so you're gonna need to speak (%hesitation%) as much languages as you can in order to have a really good job or your dream job let's say
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 14.77 24.08 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the contrary side when we have this is that (%hesitation%) you're not taking into account just the other subjects related to your p d h
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 24.08 29.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so somebody could say that is that one's enough you know
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 29.05 39.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) from my personal point of view i would say that as much as you can just try to speak (%hesitation%) too many different languages
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 39.02 53.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and it would be a plus if you can talk (%hesitation%) arabian or even chinese or japanese because those are the ones (%hesitation%) that are forgotten by all everybody and are the tough ones
SI114J-00498-P30017 1 SI114J-00498 53.59 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if you can speak that you're gonna have a really good job you know for all your
SI114J-00498-P50019 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 6.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well they have to go to foreign (%hesitation%) newspapers
SI114J-00498-P50019 1 SI114J-00498 6.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) using the internet is the best option for them to have this international being (%hesitation%) aware of what's happening in the world today
SI114J-00498-P50020 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 1.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> absolutely not
SI114J-00498-P50020 1 SI114J-00498 1.44 5.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i do not agree because i think that is a nonsense
SI114J-00498-P50020 1 SI114J-00498 5.21 9.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> how come there are not gonna be some newspapers in the future
SI114J-00498-P50020 1 SI114J-00498 9.05 18.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you know (%hesitation%) even if we are using this net (%hesitation%) every second there are too many people that love paper news
SI114J-00498-P50020 1 SI114J-00498 18.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00498-P50021 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 0.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not
SI114J-00498-P50021 1 SI114J-00498 0.89 2.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i wouldn't say so
SI114J-00498-P50021 1 SI114J-00498 2.36 5.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is not a reliable source of news
SI114J-00498-P50021 1 SI114J-00498 5.07 19.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00498-P50021 1 SI114J-00498 19.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't understand
SI114J-00498-P50022 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 3.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it depends on your work you know
SI114J-00498-P50022 1 SI114J-00498 3.06 5.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and if (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00498-P50022 1 SI114J-00498 5.72 14.15 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't really think it's such an important thing to to be updated with this local news you know
SI114J-00498-P50022 1 SI114J-00498 14.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> coz normally nothing happens so it's ok for you just to relax and
SI114J-00498-P50023 1 SI114J-00498 0.00 11.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's true but you know nowadays we're in this (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) pandemic environment so what would you want to have
SI114J-00498-P50023 1 SI114J-00498 11.68 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would like to have to to be in in in another planet but that is not the the question
SI114J-00498-P50023 1 SI114J-00498 18.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so yes there are too many bad
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 0.00 15.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it is generally accepted that honey is so well known and also well consumed by all humans because it is so delicious and it has a lot of (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a lot of uses
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 15.91 17.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but how are we gonna get it
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 17.49 22.36 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well first bees collect the nectar from every type of flower
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 22.36 32.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> afterwards of course these bees go to their beehives and they start (%hesitation%) to make this honey in there
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 32.02 42.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so when it's already done there is a time for the beekeeper to go and to get all that nectar or all the honey that has been made and produced
SI114J-00501-P40018 1 SI114J-00501 42.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> to go to continue (%hesitation%) its process for example this honey is put into different containers which later are transport and carried to different (%hesitation%) shops supermarkets and they are stored there for selling
SI114J-00511-P10005 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 8.40 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm not really interested in music because i've never learn to play any instruments
SI114J-00511-P10005 1 SI114J-00511 8.40 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) however i think it would be great (%hesitation%) to take time to learn a little bit of piano because i think the sound of this instrument is magical
SI114J-00511-P10006 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 5.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> i've always been interested in travelling in different places
SI114J-00511-P10006 1 SI114J-00511 5.29 9.13 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i do it as much as i can
SI114J-00511-P10006 1 SI114J-00511 9.13 16.55 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example this summer i visited (%hesitation%) the the island of madeira
SI114J-00511-P10006 1 SI114J-00511 16.55 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and it was a beautiful island
SI114J-00511-P10007 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i had the chance to meet a famous person i will definitely chose to meet the president of the french republic because i think it's a very important job
SI114J-00511-P10008 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 13.95 <o,Q5,C,P1> speaking english will help help me in the future both for travelling all around the world because everyone nowadays speaks english but also for my job
SI114J-00511-P10008 1 SI114J-00511 13.95 18.19 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it will improve a lot (%hesitation%) my career
SI114J-00511-P10008 1 SI114J-00511 18.19 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so yes it's important
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 7.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> think there is a lot of advantages about studying at least one foreign language
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 7.82 12.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you will be able to travel in this country
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 12.88 17.09 <o,Q5,C,P3> but also (%hesitation%) you will be more open minded
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 17.09 24.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> but the disadvantage is that maybe some people don't want to travel abroad
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 24.91 41.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my opinions it's a better thing because even if you don't want to travel abroad you will be able to speak with other people coming in your country to visit you
SI114J-00511-P30017 1 SI114J-00511 41.53 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> or you will be able to find a job more easily because this kind of skills are very expected in a lots of different working field
SI114J-00511-P50019 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion internet is the best way to find international news because it's free it's intan instantaneous and you've got access to the contain (%hesitation%) and the media of all around the world
SI114J-00511-P50020 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 2.92 <o,Q5,C,P5> i totally disagree with this sentence
SI114J-00511-P50020 1 SI114J-00511 2.92 18.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> for me it is very important to have a paper in my hands and the experience of reading is totally different between reading in a screen and reading on a paper
SI114J-00511-P50020 1 SI114J-00511 18.38 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so no i disagree
SI114J-00511-P50021 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 9.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion social media is not a good way to inform yourself because anyone can post anything
SI114J-00511-P50021 1 SI114J-00511 9.11 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> in consequence there's a lot of fake news of fake information and it's a very dangerous way to inform yourself
SI114J-00511-P50022 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is very important to keep up to date with local news if you want for example to be active on your neighborhood if you want to be a full citizen with a lot of activity with your proach environment
SI114J-00511-P50023 1 SI114J-00511 0.00 12.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> i totally agree there is a lot of bad news in the media especially on the tv flash and i totally disagree with this kind of information
SI114J-00511-P50023 1 SI114J-00511 12.07 17.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's only in order to increase the audience
SI114J-00511-P50023 1 SI114J-00511 17.63 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's not good
SI114J-00517-P10005 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 6.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i really like to listen music but i don't know how to make music
SI114J-00517-P10005 1 SI114J-00517 6.42 9.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i really enjoy to listen music
SI114J-00517-P10005 1 SI114J-00517 9.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and and (al-) and also my favourite (%hesitation%) (mu-) music style is reggaeton or urban music
SI114J-00517-P10006 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 6.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love travel because you can learn a lot of things during this time well during that time
SI114J-00517-P10006 1 SI114J-00517 6.93 14.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and you can learn about the culture about the the yeah the the food all of that
SI114J-00517-P10006 1 SI114J-00517 14.93 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and you can have a new experience that it's (fore-)
SI114J-00517-P10007 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 18.20 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00517-P10007 1 SI114J-00517 18.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so yeah
SI114J-00517-P10008 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 6.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think will help me to (%hesitation%) communicate with another persons that
SI114J-00517-P10008 1 SI114J-00517 6.15 9.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00517-P10008 1 SI114J-00517 9.94 12.14 <o,Q5,B2,P1> everybody needs to know how to speak english
SI114J-00517-P10008 1 SI114J-00517 12.14 19.65 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so if you know how to speak english you can speak with another person from another country and maybe get a job in another country
SI114J-00517-P10008 1 SI114J-00517 19.65 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> or
SI114J-00517-P30017 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 1.67 <o,Q5,C,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00517-P30017 1 SI114J-00517 1.67 14.94 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think it's important to (%hesitation%) for (s-) for students to learn at least one foreign language in order to open new doors if they want to apply for a job in another country
SI114J-00517-P30017 1 SI114J-00517 14.94 25.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> more (int-) it's more (interest-) well (%hesitation%) it's more effective if that country speaks their (lang-) the same language that they learn during their university time
SI114J-00517-P30017 1 SI114J-00517 25.56 44.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) one disadvantage it's may the language can be (%hesitation%) could yeah could be difficult so if the students (%hesitation%) spend a lot of time learning this language in order to pass this order (%hesitation%) it's not (%hesitation%) so good
SI114J-00517-P30017 1 SI114J-00517 44.30 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think it's important first of all for all the students should (%hesitation%) learn english (%hesitation%) because it's a world (%hesitation%) language and then another language that they want if they have time for it
SI114J-00517-P50019 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that the best way is to search in the internet about international news because it's a (cu-) a good tool that you can use and have information in just seconds
SI114J-00517-P50019 1 SI114J-00517 14.84 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so yes that will be the best way
SI114J-00517-P50020 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 7.58 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah because the world's changing and all everything is going now in in a digital way
SI114J-00517-P50020 1 SI114J-00517 7.58 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the newspapers maybe will disappear in a future and will be replaced for digital newspapers if i can say that term
SI114J-00517-P50021 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 13.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> it depends in the source because maybe one source can say (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) wrong information about (%hesitation%) news but others (%hesitation%) say the truth
SI114J-00517-P50021 1 SI114J-00517 13.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so yeah you should check first of all the source if you want to check that
SI114J-00517-P50022 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 9.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's very important because the local news are happening in your country well in your society
SI114J-00517-P50022 1 SI114J-00517 9.38 16.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> so if something bad happens you should be yeah you should be alert
SI114J-00517-P50022 1 SI114J-00517 16.81 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) and all the only the local news show
SI114J-00517-P50023 1 SI114J-00517 0.00 8.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah of course only the news will show you all the bad news because everything's bad in this world
SI114J-00517-P50023 1 SI114J-00517 8.68 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but maybe you as a person should check also (%hesitation%) good news to to change how you (g-) the way you see the world and how you live
SI114J-00522-P10005 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 12.84 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i am really interested in the environment because nowadays i think it's very necessary to take care of the environment because (%hesitation%) this have a lot of problem
SI114J-00522-P10005 1 SI114J-00522 12.84 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think it's very important to take care of this and to take to take
SI114J-00522-P10006 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 5.21 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i usually spend long time with my friend or family
SI114J-00522-P10006 1 SI114J-00522 5.21 14.86 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i actually do different activities like to do exercise or (%hesitation%) to go to the restaurant or cinema
SI114J-00522-P10006 1 SI114J-00522 14.86 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i usually do different leisure activity with them
SI114J-00522-P10007 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 4.06 <o,Q5,A2,P1> my father is really similar me
SI114J-00522-P10007 1 SI114J-00522 4.06 11.86 <o,Q5,A2,P1> (%hesitation%) every people say when (%hesitation%) see me they say you are similar your (f-) father
SI114J-00522-P10007 1 SI114J-00522 11.86 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i really like this because i really like spend time with him and to do the same thing
SI114J-00522-P10008 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 10.79 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i would like to learn (%hesitation%) cook (%hesitation%) because i think it's a useful and entertaining skill for my life
SI114J-00522-P10008 1 SI114J-00522 10.79 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> and i think it's i would i wouldn't have to attend any course or any private class to learn this useful
SI114J-00522-P30017 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 17.06 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think in the school is necessary to do fitness class because every people need to learn the the the people need to improve (%hesitation%) their health habit
SI114J-00522-P30017 1 SI114J-00522 17.06 26.16 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) (de-) (de-) this have a lot of advantage like to the fitner fitter and healthier
SI114J-00522-P30017 1 SI114J-00522 26.16 48.63 <o,Q4,B1,P3> however these (%hesitation%) (ha-) have (%hesitation%) disadvantages to do include this in the in the school because you need have a lot of time to enough time to (%hesitation%) have (%hesitation%) a clean and you have a shower and you need to prepare any facility to have shower
SI114J-00522-P30017 1 SI114J-00522 48.63 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> therefore i think the best way to solve this situation it's to include this class and you use good facility to solve this situation
SI114J-00522-P40018 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 9.50 <o,Q4,A2,P4> i'm going to talk about the different stage necessary to gain honey
SI114J-00522-P40018 1 SI114J-00522 9.50 24.22 <o,Q4,A2,P4> as you can see in the (ima-) in the image (%hesitation%) the first stage is the bees collect the nectar from the flower and then (%hesitation%) bring this honey (%hesitation%) to the beehive
SI114J-00522-P40018 1 SI114J-00522 24.22 39.86 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) when there are enough honey in the beehive any people collect the honey and put in into different glass bottle
SI114J-00522-P40018 1 SI114J-00522 39.86 50.58 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) these this product way is really difficult because need to be need people prepare le called beekeeper
SI114J-00522-P40018 1 SI114J-00522 50.58 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then this the honey is transport by by van to the supermarket
SI114J-00522-P50019 1 SI114J-00522 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> my opinion when the student need to study in other country and need had in consideration different thing like what is the culture in this country what is the type of the school or the university and other thing

SI114J-00531-P40018 1 SI114J-00531 37.57 48.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i think that we have to stop it because the health is suffering from our activities
SI114J-00531-P40018 1 SI114J-00531 48.15 53.19 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we have to stop it as earlier as we can

SI114J-00531-P50020 1 SI114J-00531 0.00 13.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it is so important because our bodies need much water so we should to drink a lot of glasses of water
SI114J-00531-P50020 1 SI114J-00531 13.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and moreover all the lives comes from the water
SI114J-00531-P50021 1 SI114J-00531 0.00 7.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that do exercise is so good for us and for our bodies because we can be fit
SI114J-00531-P50021 1 SI114J-00531 7.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but doing exercise all the days i think that it is unhealthy because we have to do a great effort so it is so exhausting
SI114J-00531-P50022 1 SI114J-00531 0.00 13.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm agree with this because i think that each people should sleep at least eight hour a days because we have to be focused on all our tax
SI114J-00531-P50022 1 SI114J-00531 13.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think that it is so helpful for our minds
SI114J-00531-P50023 1 SI114J-00531 0.00 11.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology has (%hesitation%) evolution for all these years so i think that it is the best way for learn new skill

SI114J-00532-P10007 1 SI114J-00532 4.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) i like to watch some serials (%hesitation%) without subtitles and i try to study at least two hours a day

SI114J-00532-P30017 1 SI114J-00532 0.00 10.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think that (%hesitation%) a part time job is a good way to improve some skills
SI114J-00532-P30017 1 SI114J-00532 10.00 24.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> of course the (th-) this kind of job has to be related with the career and is a way to learn different things that than the things that you learn in university
SI114J-00532-P30017 1 SI114J-00532 24.47 29.06 <o,Q5,C,P3> at the same time a disadvantage could be the time

SI114J-00532-P30017 1 SI114J-00532 40.80 47.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) sometimes university could be really hard and you don't have time for do any other things
SI114J-00532-P30017 1 SI114J-00532 47.95 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) it could be work but it's necessary to complement both things in a in a good way
SI114J-00532-P40018 1 SI114J-00532 0.00 9.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well so (%hesitation%) pollution (%hesitation%) is caused by for example vehicles and factories

SI114J-00532-P40018 1 SI114J-00532 46.11 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this is the process of acid rain
SI114J-00532-P50019 1 SI114J-00532 0.00 4.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well first is necessary to have a schedule

SI114J-00546-P10007 1 SI114J-00546 12.57 21.71 <o,Q3,B1,P1> so when we have a time we can say a lot about our ideas

SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 0.00 6.10 <o,Q5,C,P3> all right teachers and principals welcome to this presentation on part time jobs
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 6.10 16.07 <o,Q5,C,P3> now this presentation comes under the title (%hesitation%) part time jobs for (%hesitation%) elementary and university students
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 16.07 26.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> now the first thing we need to bear in mind is that because there are some (dis-) some disadvantages there's also a bunch of (ad-) (%hesitation%) advantages
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 26.74 41.35 <o,Q5,C,P3> now the first thing to bear in mind as i said is that some of your students will be working and will be acquired meaningful experience that they (cou-) that they could use later on in your in your classes
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 41.35 44.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> so that's why they pretty much could complement your classes
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 44.92 53.29 <o,Q5,C,P3> but if you are not careful enough your students could fall behind with their with their projects or with their assignments
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 53.29 58.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> so when you notice this (%hesitation%) you need to have a word with those students right away
SI114J-00547-P30017 1 SI114J-00547 58.41 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my own opinion you should give it a
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 0.00 4.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> right teachers now welcome to this presentation on acid rain
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 4.73 13.20 <o,Q5,C,P4> now the first thing we need to consider before going any further is that factories and vehicles produce (%hesitation%) this awful pollution
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 13.20 15.34 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think everybody knows that right
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 15.34 23.64 <o,Q5,C,P4> but some of these acid particles can turn into smoke and that's the one that you can see for example all over the cities
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 23.64 30.52 <o,Q5,C,P4> nevertheless (%hesitation%) because some of these acid particles are carried by wind (%hesitation%) two things could happen
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 30.52 50.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> the first one is that (%hesitation%) some of these acid particles could fall as dust whereas (%hesitation%) other particles (%hesitation%) mix with cloud water and that's pretty much what this rain contains or this water contains that can cause the skin rash (%hesitation%) on your skin as well as other diseases
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 50.41 59.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> but i think overall what we really need to focus on is that (%hesitation%) these acid particles can damage the environment
SI114J-00547-P40018 1 SI114J-00547 59.31 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> so

SI114J-00553-P10005 1 SI114J-00553 16.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i have older (s-) (%hesitation%) (ger-) sister
SI114J-00553-P10006 1 SI114J-00553 0.00 10.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i prefer the holiday at the sea because you can (%hesitation%) swim into the wave you can get (%hesitation%) tanned

SI114J-00553-P10007 1 SI114J-00553 0.00 7.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to spend my time with my brother because i have a twin brothers

SI114J-00553-P30017 1 SI114J-00553 0.00 33.91 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that studying and (%hesitation%) working at the same time is (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) absolutely a good things (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) for you because it can (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) give you the possibility to pay for your university studies
SI114J-00553-P30017 1 SI114J-00553 33.91 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and i think it is (%hesitation%) also a dangerous thing because (%hesitation%) working need time and you have to spend the time in your job instead of studying your subject and (%hesitation%) well pass the exam
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 0.00 8.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> to travel by train you have to follow some easy (%hesitation%) stage
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 8.73 14.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all you have to travel to the airport
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 14.20 19.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and at the airport you have to do the check in
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 19.03 39.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) at first is the control your document and your (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) luggage (%hesitation%) to to check that you you not have some dangerous things
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 39.75 42.11 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to wait
SI114J-00553-P40018 1 SI114J-00553 42.11 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and go on board the plane and then you you can fly to your destination
SI114J-00553-P50019 1 SI114J-00553 0.00 13.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> student can (%hesitation%) use technologies for example to search (%hesitation%) for information online on the website
SI114J-00553-P50019 1 SI114J-00553 13.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) and maybe to (%hesitation%) share their their information with

SI114J-00558-P30017 1 SI114J-00558 44.13 54.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantage maybe it's the time and the difficult do (%hesitation%) their university courses

SI114J-00562-P10007 1 SI114J-00562 15.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it's interesting that he teach me about it
SI114J-00562-P10008 1 SI114J-00562 0.00 13.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in the future i would like to have a good job in (%hesitation%) production in (%hesitation%) television or maybe in radio in radio

SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 0.00 27.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion the students who have a job when they are a student study good i think because i consider the learning about they have learnings about some topic in this job and they have experience of that and they have money for the for the university studies
SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 27.64 30.52 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantages are a lot
SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 30.52 38.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they have less time for having a student they distracted and they feeling tired
SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 38.50 48.09 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think it's a good option but we need to remember the importance that we have for studies
SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 48.09 53.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i think the best option for a job is the part time job
SI114J-00562-P30017 1 SI114J-00562 53.82 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's good than the job in all time

SI114J-00562-P40018 1 SI114J-00562 27.42 36.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> for that reason we need to have the next pass stop and wait

SI114J-00562-P50019 1 SI114J-00562 0.00 7.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think we have to use the technology in our favor
SI114J-00562-P50019 1 SI114J-00562 7.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we have some pages (%hesitation%) we have some dictionaries and pages when we have videos to study and learn some things (abopu-)

SI114J-00562-P50020 1 SI114J-00562 8.47 17.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but some people need to technology for learning or theirselves

SI114J-00562-P50021 1 SI114J-00562 17.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's a good (wel-)

SI114J-00563-P30017 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 17.42 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think the advantages of the part time jobs while they're studying is that they can get the experience of the working
SI114J-00563-P30017 1 SI114J-00563 17.42 29.34 <o,Q5,B1,P3> meanwhile the disadvantages it is they could waste their own time their studying time
SI114J-00563-P30017 1 SI114J-00563 29.34 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion the part time jobs is a very good thing because he can get (individu-) individual sense to work

SI114J-00563-P50019 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 14.34 <o,Q5,B1,P5> you don't have to eat the food which contain too much fat for example fry (%hesitation%) (f-) fried potato and hamburger
SI114J-00563-P50019 1 SI114J-00563 14.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> meanwhile you have to eat the organic food
SI114J-00563-P50020 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 6.18 <o,Q5,B1,P5> drinking water is a very important thing for us
SI114J-00563-P50020 1 SI114J-00563 6.18 15.56 <o,Q5,B1,P5> if you running or walking and sleeping you can lack the water in your body
SI114J-00563-P50020 1 SI114J-00563 15.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so you charge the water
SI114J-00563-P50021 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think doing exercise every day is a very important thing because if you (ex-) doing exercise every day you will get the habit of doing exercise
SI114J-00563-P50022 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 3.14 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think so too
SI114J-00563-P50022 1 SI114J-00563 3.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> everyone have to sleep at the least eight hours every day because everyone get the tired for example walking and work so we have to refresh to sleep
SI114J-00563-P50023 1 SI114J-00563 0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the technology will give us the positive effect (%hesitation%) because technology could management our health to improve
SI114J-00563-P50023 1 SI114J-00563 14.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so technology is useful for us

SI114J-00568-P40018 1 SI114J-00568 47.24 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as for the tunes net it increase rapidly over the week reaching almost one thousand one hundred thousand visit
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 0.00 2.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> production of honey is very interesting
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 2.55 8.34 <o,Q5,C,P4> so let me tell you how you go for from a bee to honey
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 8.34 15.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> well the first steps is for the bees to collect the honey from flowers to flowers (%hesitation%) in a (p-) in a small perimeter
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 15.68 20.60 <o,Q5,C,P4> once they have collected the nectar from the flowers they will go back to the beehives
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 20.60 25.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> there they will make the honey from the nectar that's been collected
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 25.30 29.18 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 29.18 40.27 <o,Q5,C,P4> it can be very dangerous because you can be (bi-) bite (f-) by the bees so it is very important to have the right (%hesitation%) the right protection (%hesitation%) clothes
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 40.27 49.47 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) when the beekeepers have collected the honey it is important to (%hesitation%) store it into glass can (%hesitation%) in order to protect the honey
SI114J-00569-P40018 1 SI114J-00569 49.47 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that you just need to drive the honey to the stores and to decide how much you want to sell it and how much you want to buy it
SI114J-00570-P10005 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 2.96 <o,Q5,B2,P1> really interested in music

SI114J-00570-P10006 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 4.31 <o,Q5,B2,P1> travelling i think is the best thing ever

SI114J-00570-P10006 1 SI114J-00570 15.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's the it's (%hesitation%) really nice to travel

SI114J-00570-P10008 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 4.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the main language in science is english
SI114J-00570-P10008 1 SI114J-00570 4.35 12.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) because i want to be a really good researcher i need to have a fluency in english
SI114J-00570-P10008 1 SI114J-00570 12.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it's very important for me to get a good level in this language
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 10.14 <o,Q5,C,P3> my point of view there are not disadvantage of studying a foreign language (%hesitation%) for university students
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 10.14 15.46 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) moreover i think that there are more advantage than disadvantage
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 15.46 21.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> this is because studying a foreign language (%hesitation%) is very enriching for students
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 21.82 36.44 <o,Q5,C,P3> they probably will use it (%hesitation%) in their future in in the development of their of their of their occupancy of their different jobs
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 36.44 50.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> and knowing (%hesitation%) different language and being fluency in another de language that is not the the mother language is useful for their for their future jobs
SI114J-00570-P30017 1 SI114J-00570 50.81 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion it's very important to learn a language nowadays because we are very
SI114J-00570-P50019 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 6.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> past it was necessary to buy a newspaper to be informed about international news
SI114J-00570-P50019 1 SI114J-00570 6.57 12.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but nowadays yes using social media you can be well informed
SI114J-00570-P50019 1 SI114J-00570 12.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can use for example (%hesitation%) twitter or
SI114J-00570-P50020 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 1.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> agree with that
SI114J-00570-P50020 1 SI114J-00570 1.85 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because there are still many people that prefer reading things from paper and there is people that hate using social media and (%hesitation%) going through going through networks
SI114J-00570-P50021 1 SI114J-00570 0.00 4.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> media it can be a really good tool to be informed
SI114J-00570-P50021 1 SI114J-00570 4.20 6.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but you have to be careful with it
SI114J-00570-P50021 1 SI114J-00570 6.38 16.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe you can establish you can change the settings (%hesitation%) of this and put for example which kind of music you prefer
SI114J-00570-P50021 1 SI114J-00570 16.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because sometimes for

SI114J-00570-P50022 1 SI114J-00570 4.75 14.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but the thing is that (%hesitation%) at the end i think that is very important to get up to date and to be informed
SI114J-00570-P50022 1 SI114J-00570 14.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because sometimes you don't get all the information that

SI114J-00570-P50023 1 SI114J-00570 9.57 14.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) being over informed informed it can be really bad
SI114J-00570-P50023 1 SI114J-00570 14.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and for example such as with coronavirus

SI114J-00571-P10005 1 SI114J-00571 3.39 8.25 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think due to is something that my sister is really carrying on

SI114J-00571-P10005 1 SI114J-00571 14.57 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think that this is the key factor because i love music

SI114J-00571-P10008 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 14.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> well actually in my case i will say that (%hesitation%) speak english give me the opportunity to to maybe apply to a job in in a different country (%hesitation%) different from spain
SI114J-00571-P10008 1 SI114J-00571 14.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think that also on the same time i can travel to other country and (%hesitation%) speak right
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 9.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> it's widely argued (%hesitation%) among teachers that all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass university course
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 9.45 12.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) nevertheless some people ask themselve
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 12.39 17.86 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all there are so many advantages and disadvantages that we need to talk about
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 17.86 33.32 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example (%hesitation%) the more than students (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) study a language the more knowledge that they will have about them and the more opportunity that they will have in their future (li-) labour for example in kind of works and jobs
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 33.32 44.49 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) however at the same times (%hesitation%) is really horrible to students who think that if we don't have other language (%hesitation%) they can't pass their university course
SI114J-00571-P30017 1 SI114J-00571 44.49 54.96 <o,Q5,C,P3> so as far as comparing i'm inclinate to believe that in my opinion i think that (%hesitation%) student (%hesitation%) needs to have like a minimum minim (%hesitation%) of level in other language

SI114J-00571-P50019 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 16.78 <o,Q5,C,P5> in the case of of a student they use social medias (%hesitation%) every time and every day so the best way to find international new maybe it's it's in social media due as just say they use all the time
SI114J-00571-P50019 1 SI114J-00571 16.78 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> also in newspaper for example or in

SI114J-00571-P50021 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 17.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) nowadays i would say that social media is no a reliable form of new you know due to everyone can post (%hesitation%) imaging or information that sometimes i want to say that that is the true it is false
SI114J-00571-P50021 1 SI114J-00571 17.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so but also happen the same in
SI114J-00571-P50022 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 18.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> well it is a fact that we live in a technological society but if we live in a town for example local news are really important due to they are like the key factor of the the the star of the news like newspaper and radio for example
SI114J-00571-P50022 1 SI114J-00571 18.45 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that try to
SI114J-00571-P50023 1 SI114J-00571 0.00 5.05 <o,Q5,C,P5> that depend about what you understand with the word bad news
SI114J-00571-P50023 1 SI114J-00571 5.05 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> for example we have so many fake new but if you say bad news for example if you (%hesitation%) watch the television (%hesitation%) like in my case every day (%hesitation%) in the world we have so many horrible things that happen and i think that this is life you know
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 0.00 5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> what are the advantages
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 5.62 13.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> when it comes to advantages (%hesitation%) you need to you will get the funds from the university because you will be doing the job
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 13.69 22.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and (i-) in this case you will not (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) be taking funds from the your parents and you will be not worried about your thesis
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 22.57 30.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) when it comes to disadvantages disadvantages are for example you will be not focused properly when it comes to studies
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 30.24 36.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the (m-) the most important thing is time management how you will manage the time
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 36.72 42.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion on this is (%hesitation%) it's really good idea to get the job from the university
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 42.94 51.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) when it comes to me (%hesitation%) i can see i can easily manage this as i am doing already job with my studies
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 51.14 56.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it will be really good for me because i will be not taking funds from my parents
SI114J-00573-P30017 1 SI114J-00573 56.55 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> thank you
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 0.00 9.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all you need to take a taxi or bus or train to get to the airport
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 9.47 13.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after reaching the airport you need to check in
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 13.82 17.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you need to show your (%hesitation%) boarding pass
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 17.25 25.57 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that you will show your all documents belongings for example passport and other i d documentation
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 25.57 30.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that you will go through the security to check your luggages that what you are bringing
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 30.71 35.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that you will wait in the waiting area for the boarding
SI114J-00573-P40018 1 SI114J-00573 35.89 43.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and there you can go to the toilet you can eat food have coffee or buy some souvenirs

SI114J-00578-P10008 1 SI114J-00578 5.51 12.46 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i have just gone the bachata classes
SI114J-00578-P10008 1 SI114J-00578 12.46 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> it is very interesting
SI114J-00578-P50022 1 SI114J-00578 0.00 2.01 <o,Q5,A2,P5> of course
SI114J-00578-P50022 1 SI114J-00578 2.01 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> the people do need eighteen hours every day because your body and your mind it is better when you are sleeping eight hours
SI114J-00579-P10005 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 10.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like music as everyone does but no i'm not so so much interesting
SI114J-00579-P10005 1 SI114J-00579 10.45 12.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i recognise it
SI114J-00579-P10005 1 SI114J-00579 12.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) normal recon dron normal interested
SI114J-00579-P10006 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 9.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm keen on travelling to different places (%hesitation%) mostly to different cities and countries
SI114J-00579-P10006 1 SI114J-00579 9.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am an architect and i like to to see different architecture and a cosmolitan place
SI114J-00579-P10007 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 3.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think i would like to meet obama
SI114J-00579-P10007 1 SI114J-00579 3.84 14.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think he's an interesting person that has treated (%hesitation%) quite important issue
SI114J-00579-P10007 1 SI114J-00579 14.91 18.46 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think he's a good person too
SI114J-00579-P10007 1 SI114J-00579 18.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think
SI114J-00579-P10008 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 6.38 <o,Q4,B2,P1> speaking english it won't help me my job
SI114J-00579-P10008 1 SI114J-00579 6.38 13.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but as everyone it would be nice to speak it well when i travel
SI114J-00579-P10008 1 SI114J-00579 13.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it will be useful
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 9.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 9.29 23.33 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the advantage of it i think is that is quite useful (%hesitation%) (f-) to (%hesitation%) looking for a work (%hesitation%) can speak in other language
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 23.33 28.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it could be useful to their job in the future
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 28.29 34.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> about the disvantage (%hesitation%) i don't think there are really any disvantage
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 34.76 48.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> perhaps in the last courses they don't have enough time (%hesitation%) because they have a lot of material (%hesitation%) of his own course but it's not really a disvantage
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 48.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion as more language you know is would be better for you
SI114J-00579-P50019 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 8.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> students to find out international news i guess is the the internet
SI114J-00579-P50019 1 SI114J-00579 8.57 14.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) there they can find every type of news and it's free
SI114J-00579-P50019 1 SI114J-00579 14.75 18.91 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for them is very easy to use the technology
SI114J-00579-P50019 1 SI114J-00579 18.91 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they are used to
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 3.53 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i am of this opinion
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 3.53 8.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) every day we use more and more technology
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 8.05 13.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we have to reduce our consume of (pap-) our paper consume
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 13.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i suppose (%hesitation%) the news we'll search the news in the internet
SI114J-00579-P50021 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 6.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion social media are not a reliable way of news

SI114J-00579-P50022 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 7.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think to keep up to day on local news is very important
SI114J-00579-P50022 1 SI114J-00579 7.36 11.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i find for my work is necessary
SI114J-00579-P50022 1 SI114J-00579 11.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you can do better when you are good well informed about your news (%hesitation%) your local news
SI114J-00579-P50023 1 SI114J-00579 0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by other by one way i i guess (%hesitation%) to know the bad news to to know it (%hesitation%) is important to know what happen in the world
SI114J-00579-P50023 1 SI114J-00579 11.94 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but by other way other hand (%hesitation%) you we get used to the bad news and is not so important
SI114J-00580-P40018 1 SI114J-00580 0.00 10.21 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the following diagram show how honey is produce from the nectar of the flowers to then be sold in stores
SI114J-00580-P40018 1 SI114J-00580 10.21 14.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> is already known that bees make honey
SI114J-00580-P40018 1 SI114J-00580 14.34 24.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so first they collect nectar from flowers for then (%hesitation%) take it to the beehives in order to make honey
SI114J-00580-P40018 1 SI114J-00580 24.27 38.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> is also known that bees make honey in their bee combs but in the case of marketing (%hesitation%) beehives are used to (%hesitation%) get honey made by bees
SI114J-00580-P40018 1 SI114J-00580 38.03 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then beekeepers collect honey from the beehives and then (%hesitation%) fill their containers which they will be distributed in every stores and markets for then be sold by the customers
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 0.00 10.63 <o,Q5,C,P3> i remember two years ago when i was travelling to the united states and there as an student i got a job
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 10.63 20.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> indeed i realised that moment that i was able to broaden my horizons to open up new opportunities and develop a professional career
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 20.88 26.40 <o,Q5,C,P3> these are indeed the most important advantages of having a job while studying
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 26.40 29.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> nevertheless there are some drawbacks to consider
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 29.74 42.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> for instance it is said that if we work while studying our marks will be lowered and therefore perhaps our future will be even worse
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 42.00 47.14 <o,Q5,C,P3> it is said as well that (%hesitation%) we are all very important people
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 47.14 48.27 <o,Q5,C,P3> what would you do
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 48.27 58.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> if i were you i would definitely combine two kind of activities coz the future will be improved whether you're able to do all of these activities
SI114J-00582-P30017 1 SI114J-00582 58.56 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> let's do it
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 0.00 3.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> afternoon everyone
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 3.23 7.17 <o,Q5,C,P4> to this lecture is about travelling about airplane
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 7.17 9.64 <o,Q5,C,P4> i'm going to explain to you how to do that
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 9.64 20.28 <o,Q5,C,P4> of course first of all we should decide which means of transport to use whereas cars train or just bus
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 20.28 24.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> i would recommend you to use the bus coz it's close to the bus station
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 24.91 30.29 <o,Q5,C,P4> once we arrive to the terminal it is of utmost importance to do the check in
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 30.29 37.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> of course then we'll pass document control through the security people who are there waiting for us
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 37.91 46.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> afterwards we'll have enough time for waiting in the wait room for having some beverages and drinks
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 46.13 54.60 <o,Q5,C,P4> if i were you i would definitely have some water just because you are not permitted to use that during the flight
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 54.60 58.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> and finally you'll be able to board and to take off the plane
SI114J-00582-P40018 1 SI114J-00582 58.31 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> i hope that this (use-)

SI114J-00591-P10005 1 SI114J-00591 10.75 13.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think is a really nice district
SI114J-00591-P10005 1 SI114J-00591 13.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can i can go by walk to every place i need to be like my job for
SI114J-00591-P10006 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 4.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> on holidays i will enjoy to spend time with my family and my friends
SI114J-00591-P10006 1 SI114J-00591 4.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and my most (%hesitation%) favourite way to pass this time is going to some pub or some bar having dinner outside but mostly have some beers with my people

SI114J-00591-P10007 1 SI114J-00591 4.47 6.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we have many things in common
SI114J-00591-P10007 1 SI114J-00591 6.78 14.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we would like to go to bars we would like to do some easy sport go for example go for a long walkings around the town
SI114J-00591-P10007 1 SI114J-00591 14.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we enjoy talking to each other a lot
SI114J-00591-P10008 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 8.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00591-P10008 1 SI114J-00591 8.11 11.33 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i i would really like to get in
SI114J-00591-P10008 1 SI114J-00591 11.33 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i would really love to spend the rest of my life working there
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i can see that one of advantages of having a job for your university fees could be that you feel like i don't know self like a self achievement
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 14.76 20.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think that the disadvantages are far more important
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 20.45 33.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> like if you spend most of the time working at a job it is difficult for you to really (%hesitation%) get (%hesitation%) good student time
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 33.49 44.26 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that university students students have to work for paying their studies
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 44.26 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand there should be the government who provide (%hesitation%) scholarships for all the people to go the university in case that they really want to do it
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 7.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first part you need to achieve is to get into the airport
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 7.03 14.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so for this you could choose your own vehicle or just get some of the public transport that your city provide
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 14.29 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it could be buses or the metro
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 17.66 22.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you get into the airport you should check in firstly
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 22.14 32.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you will have to show your (%hesitation%) i d information your i d document for the (%hesitation%) security people
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 32.97 43.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> also you will need to show your luggage (%hesitation%) in order for the security people to control that there's not any weapon inside
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 43.91 48.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just need to wait for your plane to leave
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 48.34 53.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the moment of getting into the into the plane is very easy
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 53.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you just need to follow the arrows and then you will be ready to fly
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 7.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> the main way to use technology for studying is to use it to get information
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 7.25 13.15 <o,Q4,C,P5> now with internet we just have all the information in the world handwritten
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 13.15 18.39 <o,Q4,C,P5> so you just need to have a laptop or maybe a phone
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 18.39 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> that's all
SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i believe face to face learning with a teacher it's the best way i think to create some confidence between the lecturer and the and the pupils
SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591 10.61 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and to and for the students to be confident about resolving doubts asking questions and maybe get more information
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 7.82 <o,Q4,C,P5> group projects provide the students the opportunity to (%hesitation%) work in collaboration to other person
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591 7.82 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and the most important thing of this i think it is that they can (%hesitation%) learn how to improve their work with the opinion of the other colleagues
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 7.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> attending lectures is more effective than reading alone only when the lecturer is a good one
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591 7.63 11.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> but sadly this is not always the situation
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591 11.04 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i think this question just depends on what are the lecturing skills in education
SI114J-00591-P50023 1 SI114J-00591 0.00 11.10 <o,Q4,C,P5> nowadays it is vital for universities to provide modern facilities because universities can't (%hesitation%) run by living outside the real world
SI114J-00591-P50023 1 SI114J-00591 11.10 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so it is very important that students could learn using their day to day skills and opportunities
SI114J-00595-P30017 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 11.68 <o,Q5,B1,P3> there are (%hesitation%) some advantage if this (%hesitation%) this idea (%hesitation%) is implemented in all the universities
SI114J-00595-P30017 1 SI114J-00595 11.68 32.88 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example i think that the most important advantage is that if the if the part time job are (%hesitation%) are obligatory in schools it will help to increase the rate of (%hesitation%) labour experience in the university students
SI114J-00595-P30017 1 SI114J-00595 32.88 39.80 <o,Q5,B1,P3> there is a (require-) a requirement that the companies need to hire new staff
SI114J-00595-P30017 1 SI114J-00595 39.80 52.79 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the but disadvantage could be that the the students could (%hesitation%) feel overwhelment about the this exhausted activity
SI114J-00595-P30017 1 SI114J-00595 52.79 60.35 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but in my opinion i think it is very important because i would like to get (%hesitation%) labour experience
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 6.56 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) i'm going to present information that are being showed (%hesitation%) in the picture
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 6.56 13.52 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the information is about acid rained that about the cycle of ash rained
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 13.52 21.14 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the cycle of acid rain starts (%hesitation%) in the factories that produce (%hesitation%) pollution
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 21.14 35.36 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) due to the wind (%hesitation%) the acid particles marks are mixed (%hesitation%) with the air and in with the clouds
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 35.36 53.41 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it produce that some of acid particles fell down (%hesitation%) in the in the wind but (%hesitation%) the other part (%hesitation%) fall down in the drops of the (r-) of the rain when the weather is rained
SI114J-00595-P40018 1 SI114J-00595 53.41 60.35 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it produce that (%hesitation%) a lot of damage in the flora and fauna in the area
SI114J-00595-P50019 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 20.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> my best (%hesitation%) advice is eating more fruits and vegetables because some people (%hesitation%) forget that these group of aliments are very important (%hesitation%) to our health
SI114J-00595-P50020 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 6.54 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's very important because our body is conformed by seventy percent of water
SI114J-00595-P50020 1 SI114J-00595 6.54 18.66 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so if we don't drink enough water our body will (%hesitation%) not be doing the functions as the best way
SI114J-00595-P50020 1 SI114J-00595 18.66 20.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's very important
SI114J-00595-P50021 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes it's very important because the working out we improve our metabolism and also it's very important because our muscles need to be movement by ourself
SI114J-00595-P50022 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 13.33 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i am not completely agree because for example i have (s-) (s-) sleeped (%hesitation%) six hours since i am in the university and i feel very well
SI114J-00595-P50022 1 SI114J-00595 13.33 20.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so i think (%hesitation%) that does not all people need a lot of (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00595-P50023 1 SI114J-00595 0.00 18.29 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it depends of each people because some people only use the technology for their leisure but (%hesitation%) the other part in the other hand (%hesitation%) we have the people that use the technology for their work or for their studies
SI114J-00595-P50023 1 SI114J-00595 18.29 20.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example i am one
SI114J-00597-P10005 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 10.84 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries because i like a lot geography and i (li-) like a lot travelling
SI114J-00597-P10005 1 SI114J-00597 10.84 15.38 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like to travel to france because i love paris
SI114J-00597-P10005 1 SI114J-00597 15.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i would like to travel to germany too
SI114J-00597-P10006 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 6.81 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i spending my free time with my family or with my friends
SI114J-00597-P10006 1 SI114J-00597 6.81 14.12 <o,Q5,B1,P1> for example i like a lot (%hesitation%) going to the beach or (%hesitation%) going to the cinema
SI114J-00597-P10006 1 SI114J-00597 14.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> also i like a lot eating (%hesitation%) in a restaurant
SI114J-00597-P10007 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 4.67 <o,Q5,B1,P1> the best way to improve my english is travelling abroad
SI114J-00597-P10007 1 SI114J-00597 4.67 10.28 <o,Q5,B1,P1> for example in my last trip i was in london
SI114J-00597-P10007 1 SI114J-00597 10.28 15.45 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i could practise english with native people
SI114J-00597-P10007 1 SI114J-00597 15.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it was a great experience
SI114J-00597-P10008 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 9.90 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if i could learn a new skill i think that i could learn to play the piano
SI114J-00597-P10008 1 SI114J-00597 9.90 18.30 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i was a child i always (%hesitation%) dreamed (%hesitation%) about the idea of learning to play the piano
SI114J-00597-P10008 1 SI114J-00597 18.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's my dream
SI114J-00597-P30017 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 12.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i'd agree with the idea that students should do part time jobs while they are studying because it has a lot of advantages
SI114J-00597-P30017 1 SI114J-00597 12.52 25.91 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one advantage could be for example that they would have their own money in order to spend them in all what they want
SI114J-00597-P30017 1 SI114J-00597 25.91 41.42 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some disadvantages for example could be that in this case they haven't or they (%hesitation%) wouldn't have enough time in order to study
SI114J-00597-P30017 1 SI114J-00597 41.42 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) i would like to be brief i think that (%hesitation%) it would be a very good idea that they should do part time because they have money for them
SI114J-00597-P40018 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 5.63 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about acid rain and its effects
SI114J-00597-P40018 1 SI114J-00597 5.63 20.13 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) as you can see in the image in the picture (%hesitation%) firstly (%hesitation%) pollution goes up (%hesitation%) in acid particles which are in smoke
SI114J-00597-P40018 1 SI114J-00597 20.13 39.51 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) these acid particulars are carried by wind (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) then (%hesitation%) some acid particle fall as dust (%hesitation%) and it can fall (%hesitation%) over rivers for example or over the the forest
SI114J-00597-P40018 1 SI114J-00597 39.51 54.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then other acid particles makes with cloud water and when it rains acid particulars (%hesitation%) that are in rain or snow (%hesitation%) fall over (%hesitation%) the trees
SI114J-00597-P40018 1 SI114J-00597 54.12 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it damage to the environment and it's dangerous for it
SI114J-00597-P50019 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i should tell to this kind of peoples (%hesitation%) who want (%hesitation%) to have eating habits that (%hesitation%) they should eat (%hesitation%) food (%hesitation%) that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it hasn't carbohydrates
SI114J-00597-P50020 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 8.87 <o,Q5,B1,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00597-P50020 1 SI114J-00597 8.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and your blood (%hesitation%) will be (%hesitation%) much healthier than it (%hesitation%) you didn't drink water
SI114J-00597-P50021 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 11.71 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's very important to do exercise every day and it's very important to be active in in order to be (%hesitation%) an active person
SI114J-00597-P50021 1 SI114J-00597 11.71 18.71 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it (%hesitation%) will allow you to burn bad sort of things that are in your organism
SI114J-00597-P50021 1 SI114J-00597 18.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and
SI114J-00597-P50022 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 6.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think you should sleep (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) between six and eight hours a day
SI114J-00597-P50022 1 SI114J-00597 6.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my case i used to sleep (%hesitation%) six hours a days and when i wake up i am very very well i am very powerful and i can do all what you i want
SI114J-00597-P50023 1 SI114J-00597 0.00 17.64 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it can have (%hesitation%) a very bad (%hesitation%) effect a negative (%hesitation%) effect because (%hesitation%) there are really a lot of people who spends a lot of hour (%hesitation%) a lot of who spends a lot of time with (%hesitation%) their mobile phones
SI114J-00597-P50023 1 SI114J-00597 17.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but you can use
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 0.00 4.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in the one hand some advantages
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 4.23 13.52 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) they can (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) experience about (%hesitation%) (wor-) (fut-) future (%hesitation%) work
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 13.52 21.41 <o,Q5,B1,P3> moreover they can (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) organise in your in your in their work
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 21.41 24.80 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in the other hand some disadvantages
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 24.80 27.83 <o,Q5,B1,P3> they have less time to study
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 27.83 35.30 <o,Q5,B1,P3> they has (%hesitation%) less (%hesitation%) time to (%hesitation%) study (%hesitation%) other (%hesitation%) subject
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 35.30 44.61 <o,Q5,B1,P3> they they have less energy to study (%hesitation%) when they (%hesitation%) go to university
SI114J-00599-P30017 1 SI114J-00599 44.61 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion both option is (%hesitation%) both option are good because (%hesitation%) they can have (%hesitation%) a lot of experience about (fu-) future work
SI114J-00599-P40018 1 SI114J-00599 0.00 9.68 <o,Q5,B1,P4> further i can see a excellent fantastic and incredible (%hesitation%) diagram about (%hesitation%) music
SI114J-00599-P40018 1 SI114J-00599 9.68 26.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and i can see (t-) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) at diagram i can (%hesitation%) see (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a lot of people (%hesitation%) visited to three new online pop music site

SI114J-00604-P30017 1 SI114J-00604 8.19 25.25 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) the advantage may be that student will can develop news skill and learn a new language to be more intelligent
SI114J-00604-P30017 1 SI114J-00604 25.25 28.35 <o,Q5,B1,P3> it's positive for them also

SI114J-00604-P30017 1 SI114J-00604 41.99 50.60 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and the disadvantage maybe is they they will have less time to study or less free time
SI114J-00604-P30017 1 SI114J-00604 50.60 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so in my opinion is positive because we can develop (%hesitation%) relationships and (mo-)

SI114J-00611-P50020 1 SI114J-00611 0.00 12.24 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i disagree this question because i think in the future alls newspaper (%hesitation%) can be less
SI114J-00611-P50020 1 SI114J-00611 12.24 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> but (%hesitation%) i all people like reading a newspaper

SI114J-00627-P30017 1 SI114J-00627 0.00 7.86 <o,Q5,C,P3> i know that most of the university students have to have a part time job to make ends meet
SI114J-00627-P30017 1 SI114J-00627 7.86 26.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion the main advantage about this is that you can learned about the real world and have more conscious about the value of the money and probably if is an internship you can have a lot of experience in your future job
SI114J-00627-P30017 1 SI114J-00627 26.57 35.96 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) consequently the main disadvantage is that these people have less time to (%hesitation%) focus on their studies or to socialise
SI114J-00627-P30017 1 SI114J-00627 35.96 40.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> that is something essential during your young years

SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 4.38 10.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all you know that factories and vehicles create a lot of pollution
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 10.09 18.28 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at at the end this pollution (%hesitation%) swim up to the air like acids particles in smoke
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 18.28 22.32 <o,Q5,B2,P4> thens the acid particle are carry on by the wind
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 22.32 33.83 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some of them (%hesitation%) fall down in water like rivers or sea which at the end ends in the fish that we are eating
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 33.83 50.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> other of these acid particulars (%hesitation%) become clouds and when it rains (%hesitation%) these (%hesitation%) rain is acid which effect to the forest or even ourselves because it it can touch you
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 50.70 55.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> probably you will (%hesitation%) suffer burns in your skin
SI114J-00627-P40018 1 SI114J-00627 55.02 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so at the end if we don't take care of the pollution we are the most affected
SI114J-00628-P10007 1 SI114J-00628 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> (%hesitation%) i have improve in my english the vocabulary the (%hesitation%) reading and the comprehension of the text
SI114J-00628-P30017 1 SI114J-00628 0.00 9.41 <o,Q5,A2,P3> the advantage are that the topics are more learned because the brain has more reception capacity
SI114J-00628-P30017 1 SI114J-00628 9.41 16.89 <o,Q5,A2,P3> and the disvantage are the great fatigue that produce so much information

SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 0.00 19.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so the first music site is called (%hesitation%) tuner net and it's been it was fluctuating for three days in a row and then it (%hesitation%) suddenly began to rise the visiting of this site began to rise
SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 19.00 38.44 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) comparing to it (%hesitation%) the site song for you has been fluctuating for a while then it leveled off and then all of a sudden it started to plummet and (%hesitation%) there was a considerable (%hesitation%) downturn in visiting this site among different visitors
SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 38.44 41.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> the last music site is called music now
SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 41.63 50.27 <o,Q5,C,P4> and comparing to the previous two sites (%hesitation%) there was (%hesitation%) dramatic growth at the very beginning
SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 50.27 53.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> that then it was fluctuating and levelling off
SI114J-00637-P40018 1 SI114J-00637 53.38 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then there was a small fall (%hesitation%) but it kept its positions
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 0.00 1.66 <o,Q5,C,P3> all right guys
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 1.66 3.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> let me put this straight
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 3.16 15.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) one of the things that you need to consider when you start your bachelor's degree is that while you're studying (%hesitation%) it is compulsory for some students to get a job
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 15.02 28.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think one of the problems that you could get if you did that is that (%hesitation%) when you work and study at the same time (%hesitation%) you balanced out (%hesitation%) that experience
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 28.91 32.71 <o,Q5,C,P3> in other words you can use what you learn and use it in your workplace
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 32.71 40.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> nevertheless (%hesitation%) you need to manage your time properly because most of the time students don't do it
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 40.39 48.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> and they end up having problems with the teachers because of their homework or even projects i don't know seminar something like that
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 48.58 59.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my own opinion i think students (%hesitation%) should do this if they want to improve their skills and want to get a better job once they finish
SI114J-00638-P30017 1 SI114J-00638 59.62 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> (ye-)
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 0.00 5.10 <o,Q5,C,P4> all right guys welcome to this presentation on acid rains
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 5.10 17.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> now before we start i just want to let you know that this presentation is going to affect the way you (%hesitation%) you think about (%hesitation%) (environ-) the environment
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 17.77 26.15 <o,Q5,C,P4> now the first thing you need to take into account is that factories and vehicles or cars if you wanna call them (%hesitation%) produce pollution
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 26.15 29.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> now what happens to this pollution
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 29.11 36.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> this pollution goes into the air in in smoke (%hesitation%) and here is what happens
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 36.73 41.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) some of this smoke can turn into particles and they fall as dust
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 41.13 53.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> but others mix (w-) with cloud water and when your rains it's what this water contains that causes (%hesitation%) the skin rash that you could develop on your skin
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 53.85 55.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> so you'd better be careful
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 55.13 58.66 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it is also what damages the environment
SI114J-00638-P40018 1 SI114J-00638 58.66 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> so that's pretty much the
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 0.00 3.36 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now teachers welcome to this presentation on honey
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 3.36 5.94 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i decided to name it from flower to shop
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 5.94 11.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now the very first thing we need to understand is that bees collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 11.07 17.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i think everybody knows that (%hesitation%) so there's no point on repeating the same information over and over again
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 17.86 25.69 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now after after that (%hesitation%) these bees carry these this (%hesitation%) nectar to the beehives
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 25.69 27.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now a beehive is like a house for bees
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 27.89 34.37 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can pretty much see them on the top part of trees yeah it's where you can find them
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 34.37 42.17 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then beekeepers show up to collect all that nectar that in this case is now honey because of the process
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 42.17 44.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then this honey is put in jars
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 44.22 47.90 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and in other words it's industrialised
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 47.90 49.85 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then these jars are sealed
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 49.85 54.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they're put in boxes and they are loaded up into vans
SI114J-00643-P40018 1 SI114J-00643 54.80 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then they're carried to supermarkets where you can find them and enjoy it with
SI114J-00651-P10005 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 3.60 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in this moment i live in salamanca
SI114J-00651-P10005 1 SI114J-00651 3.60 5.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's a beautiful place
SI114J-00651-P10005 1 SI114J-00651 5.41 7.50 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00651-P10005 1 SI114J-00651 7.50 12.11 <o,Q4,B1,P1> you must to to know the university
SI114J-00651-P10005 1 SI114J-00651 12.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) the university is the most beautiful old university in spain
SI114J-00651-P10006 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 13.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) one of the thing i enjoy most is when i go to the beach because i love the sea and i can swim every day
SI114J-00651-P10006 1 SI114J-00651 13.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i love go with my son
SI114J-00651-P10007 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P1> i would prefer to spend my free time with my son because (%hesitation%) we love go to the cinema together
SI114J-00651-P10008 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P1> i would love to be a tourist teacher because i am (%hesitation%) liking travel and there are a few many people travelling in this in this moment
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 6.49 <o,Q4,A2,P4> in the first moment moment you have to go to airport
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 6.49 15.76 <o,Q4,A2,P4> you could go at car in the train in the in the bus
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 15.76 26.21 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) the second moment you carried (%hesitation%) your bag and going to check in
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 26.21 42.36 <o,Q4,A2,P4> for (af-) after go to the control for for (%hesitation%) control your document for the security control
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 42.36 51.56 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after you go to the plane and sit down for few time
SI114J-00651-P40018 1 SI114J-00651 51.56 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after the plane fly
SI114J-00651-P50021 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> in my opinion work in group project is positive for the student because they could to learn of other person and other student
SI114J-00651-P50022 1 SI114J-00651 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> is very important in my opinion with student attending lectures because they have to learn every day with different materials and different (%hesitation%) lectures
SI114J-00653-P10005 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 4.87 <o,Q4,C,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00653-P10005 1 SI114J-00653 4.87 15.49 <o,Q4,C,P1> ever since i was little whenever i see those documentaries about other countries and their customs i always get so excited
SI114J-00653-P10005 1 SI114J-00653 15.49 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> if i had the chance i would love to go there and explore myself
SI114J-00653-P10006 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i normally spend my free time by watching films but if the weather is good i enjoy going out to the park with my friends to have a little picnic or just to lie on the grass field and enjoy the beautiful sunshine and catch up with each other
SI114J-00653-P10007 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 9.01 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think the best way to improve my english is to get exposed to more materials that is in english
SI114J-00653-P10007 1 SI114J-00653 9.01 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> if i had the time i would love to learn some new phrases with native speakers and watch a lot of english shows
SI114J-00653-P10008 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 2.77 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to learn how to surf
SI114J-00653-P10008 1 SI114J-00653 2.77 8.71 <o,Q4,C,P1> ever since i was a little kid i have always by fascinated by the ocean
SI114J-00653-P10008 1 SI114J-00653 8.71 14.37 <o,Q4,C,P1> the idea of being able to surf on the grand ocean excites me a lot
SI114J-00653-P10008 1 SI114J-00653 14.37 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and if i have the enough time and money i would love to learn how to surf
SI114J-00653-P30017 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 17.16 <o,Q4,C,P3> far as i'm concerned students with part time jobs where they are studying will provide them with the experience to explore the world and (provi-) prepare them for their work out there when they started working
SI114J-00653-P30017 1 SI114J-00653 17.16 23.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> while there are many advantages the disadvantages are clear to see too
SI114J-00653-P30017 1 SI114J-00653 23.71 35.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> working may distract the students from their initial schoolwork and will result in worse academic performances
SI114J-00653-P30017 1 SI114J-00653 35.22 51.97 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion all the students with part time jobs are (s-) required to balance their work time and study time and try to make the most of the time while they are studying and try to be efficient as much as possible
SI114J-00653-P30017 1 SI114J-00653 51.97 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> even though part time jobs provide you with real life experiences you should not forget that school life is very (imp-)
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 6.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> hi i'm here to give a presentation about acid rain
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 6.04 12.63 <o,Q4,C,P4> and let me tell you how acid rain are caused by pollution
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 12.63 24.40 <o,Q4,C,P4> with the development of modern industries factories and vehicles produce pollution with in the form of smoke which has acid particles in them
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 24.40 29.17 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the wind comes acid particles are carry out by it
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 29.17 43.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the acid particles come to the higher level of of the atmosphere some acid particles fall as dust while other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 43.59 52.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the temperature drops some acid particles falls in the form of rain or snow
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 52.59 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and eventually it will do damage to the environment
SI114J-00653-P50019 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 6.32 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think eating regularly is the best suggestion i can give right now
SI114J-00653-P50019 1 SI114J-00653 6.32 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and apart from that i personally think that eating the right amount of fat (car-) carbs and protein are also important to your health
SI114J-00653-P50020 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 5.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's of vital importance to drink lots of water every day
SI114J-00653-P50020 1 SI114J-00653 5.71 17.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is recommended by scientists to drink at least two point five liter of water every day to keep yourself energetic and hydrated
SI114J-00653-P50020 1 SI114J-00653 17.23 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you are not hydrated enough you will not be (ab-)
SI114J-00653-P50021 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 4.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> (l-) like you have to exercise every single day of the week
SI114J-00653-P50021 1 SI114J-00653 4.26 12.83 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i do believe that it is very important to exercise regularly at like four times a week
SI114J-00653-P50021 1 SI114J-00653 12.83 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i i work out four times a week and it helps me keep energetic and motivated
SI114J-00653-P50022 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 5.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion your sleep duration should depend on your own condition
SI114J-00653-P50022 1 SI114J-00653 5.86 16.14 <o,Q5,C,P5> while it is recommended a eight hour night of sleep every day by scientists it's not something everyone is required to do
SI114J-00653-P50022 1 SI114J-00653 16.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can adjust your sleep time during your own
SI114J-00653-P50023 1 SI114J-00653 0.00 15.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i believe that technology have a negative affect on our health because in nowadays a lot of young peoples stay up late to be on their phone to play video games or watch tv series
SI114J-00653-P50023 1 SI114J-00653 15.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's now affecting their sleep and thus affecting their (wh-)
SI114J-00656-P10005 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 11.41 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i have a lot of interested in music because i think the music help the people to disconnect from their routine and to (%hesitation%) help to them relax
SI114J-00656-P10005 1 SI114J-00656 11.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) therefore i usually listen (%hesitation%) music every day when i do a sport or when i meet or have any party
SI114J-00656-P10006 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 10.64 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i usually enjoy when visiting other country or to learn about other culture when i have any try
SI114J-00656-P10006 1 SI114J-00656 10.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> therefore i usually travel two or three days a week because i think it's very important to learn and understand other (t-) other culture and to communicate with other person
SI114J-00656-P10007 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 7.04 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my country there are a famous person (%hesitation%) who is a professional actor

SI114J-00656-P10008 1 SI114J-00656 15.41 18.61 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i need the english to communicate with my co worker

SI114J-00656-P50019 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 12.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to get information about the international news is to goes in online newspaper on your computer

SI114J-00656-P50020 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 9.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion i think this this is is possible because nowadays there are a lot of offer of news news online
SI114J-00656-P50020 1 SI114J-00656 9.50 17.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however i think this is a problem because i think the best ways is that read the newspaper the the traditional way
SI114J-00656-P50020 1 SI114J-00656 17.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't know if it's important
SI114J-00656-P50021 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 5.42 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion nowadays there are a lot of people who get information by the social media
SI114J-00656-P50021 1 SI114J-00656 5.42 17.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however i think this is really mistake a mistake because i think in the social media there are a lot of information (%hesitation%) which could be fake news
SI114J-00656-P50021 1 SI114J-00656 17.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> or there are a lot of information which is

SI114J-00656-P50023 1 SI114J-00656 0.00 9.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with the statement because nowadays there are lot of fake news online or or in or on tv
SI114J-00656-P50023 1 SI114J-00656 9.92 18.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think the best way to solve this situation is (%hesitation%) find out (op-) other opinion and (%hesitation%) a lot of information
SI114J-00656-P50023 1 SI114J-00656 18.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you then you

SI114J-00659-P10005 1 SI114J-00659 2.26 14.73 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am music lover and i usually listen to a to a wide variety of music for example rock pop (%hesitation%) rap
SI114J-00659-P10005 1 SI114J-00659 14.73 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it depends on the on the way that i am feeling
SI114J-00659-P10006 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 4.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the second thing that i love is travelling
SI114J-00659-P10006 1 SI114J-00659 4.36 8.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like travelling to everywhere
SI114J-00659-P10006 1 SI114J-00659 8.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it doesn't matter if i don't like the city i probably i find i will find a thing to
SI114J-00659-P10007 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 8.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i don't have (%hesitation%) a a famous person that i want to meet
SI114J-00659-P10007 1 SI114J-00659 8.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but for example i (%hesitation%) probably like meeting some (f-) (%hesitation%) music people that are
SI114J-00659-P10008 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 13.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think english is the tool to have (%hesitation%) jobs (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) new adventures (%hesitation%) travel in the future
SI114J-00659-P10008 1 SI114J-00659 13.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think english is (%hesitation%) essential for me to have a future
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 12.68 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i totally agree with the fact that the students (%hesitation%) must (%hesitation%) (l-) (%hesitation%) learn a foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 12.68 23.42 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantages are that (%hesitation%) not all people are interesting interested in (%hesitation%) studying (%hesitation%) a foreign language
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 23.42 30.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion english is the language that is going to control the world
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 30.43 32.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so they must study it
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 32.98 46.53 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it is (advanta-) the advantages are that (%hesitation%) they are going to to have a good future if they (%hesitation%) know for example english
SI114J-00659-P30017 1 SI114J-00659 46.53 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion i totally agree with study with studying english because (%hesitation%) i probably need it for all of my future
SI114J-00659-P50019 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 6.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way is the is the internet
SI114J-00659-P50019 1 SI114J-00659 6.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) in internet students have all the newspaper and magazines (%hesitation%) which (%hesitation%) talk about international news
SI114J-00659-P50020 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i totally agree with these people because (%hesitation%) nowadays (%hesitation%) we only use the internet to check (%hesitation%) the (m-) the majority of the news so i think it is true
SI114J-00659-P50021 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that social media is not (%hesitation%) the best way to to transmit news because (%hesitation%) a lot of people use them to make (%hesitation%) false news or to make (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00659-P50022 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 18.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it is important important but not (%hesitation%) in a huge way because (%hesitation%) sometimes when we (%hesitation%) know about everything it is (%hesitation%) worst for us
SI114J-00659-P50022 1 SI114J-00659 18.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think in a
SI114J-00659-P50023 1 SI114J-00659 0.00 15.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) from ma my point of view (%hesitation%) the media usually (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) give us only (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) twenty percent of the news
SI114J-00659-P50023 1 SI114J-00659 15.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it is the bad (%hesitation%) way
SI114J-00661-P10005 1 SI114J-00661 0.00 14.40 <o,Q5,A2,P1> (%hesitation%) music is very important because i i need to (%hesitation%) listen to different (%hesitation%) music for example pop classic (%hesitation%) romantic music and so on

SI114J-00661-P30017 1 SI114J-00661 8.30 17.09 <o,Q4,B1,P3> moreover they can have (%hesitation%) other skills such as languages french italy and so on
SI114J-00661-P30017 1 SI114J-00661 17.09 21.95 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in addition they can be best student in the future

SI114J-00661-P50020 1 SI114J-00661 0.00 15.38 <o,Q5,A2,P5> more or less because i always think that is the in future newspaper (%hesitation%) they will be no because nowaday we have new technology which help us to look for everything
SI114J-00661-P50020 1 SI114J-00661 15.38 18.02 <o,Q5,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) that's to say international no

SI114J-00661-P50021 1 SI114J-00661 0.00 10.03 <o,Q5,A2,P5> because i have always thought that they (%hesitation%) there will be bad place where you can no reading a good new
SI114J-00661-P50021 1 SI114J-00661 10.03 17.16 <o,Q5,A2,P5> but i always see that there are good place where you can read the best new

SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 0.00 6.93 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well (%hesitation%) the process to travel by airplane could be complex
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 6.93 14.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but i would like to explain (%hesitation%) in a few step how to travel (%hesitation%) by plane
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 14.84 21.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all you have to travel to the airport maybe by taxi by bus
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 21.46 25.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then you arrive to the airport
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 25.80 28.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you have to make the check in

SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 33.44 36.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then you go to the (%hesitation%) document (%hesitation%) control
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 36.98 42.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you have to (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) show to the security (%hesitation%) your passport
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 42.80 50.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) you have to wait (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) in a place
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 50.03 57.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can (ta-) (%hesitation%) have a coffee or maybe (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) reading a newspaper
SI114J-00662-P40018 1 SI114J-00662 57.31 60.16 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you then go on board
SI114J-00669-P40018 1 SI114J-00669 0.00 7.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'd i'd like to talk about the fall of acid rain created
SI114J-00669-P40018 1 SI114J-00669 7.04 33.14 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first the pollution from factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) are carried by smoke to the air and next the acid particles are carried by wind and some of them (%hesitation%) fall as dust to the earth
SI114J-00669-P40018 1 SI114J-00669 33.14 47.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and next other acid particles mix with cloud water and it (%hesitation%) it makes (%hesitation%) it it makes rain or snow
SI114J-00669-P40018 1 SI114J-00669 47.44 55.19 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally it would damage the environment like forests and rivers and seas
SI114J-00669-P40018 1 SI114J-00669 55.19 59.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) that's all have to say about this topic

SI114J-00672-P10006 1 SI114J-00672 0.00 15.14 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i suppose it's wonderful but (%hesitation%) unfortunately (%hesitation%) i never hadn't (%hesitation%) the opportunity to to travel around the world
SI114J-00672-P10006 1 SI114J-00672 15.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and and i i hope (%hesitation%) to
SI114J-00672-P10007 1 SI114J-00672 0.00 15.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00672-P10007 1 SI114J-00672 15.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) there are (ve-) very popular
SI114J-00672-P10008 1 SI114J-00672 0.00 15.89 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think that (%hesitation%) if you if you speak english well (%hesitation%) you you will have the opportunity to work in a a international company for example
SI114J-00672-P10008 1 SI114J-00672 15.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> or a a or or or you have the (possi-)
SI114J-00672-P30017 1 SI114J-00672 0.00 38.48 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) well (%hesitation%) i think there are many advantages for that but but i believe that the main one is that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) you you will leave (%hesitation%) the university (%hesitation%) and you you will can (%hesitation%) to talk with (%hesitation%) with (%hesitation%) other people around the world (%hesitation%) in english (%hesitation%) or or a or a (for-) (%hesitation%) (for-) a another foreign language
SI114J-00672-P30017 1 SI114J-00672 38.48 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and on the other hand perhaps the main disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) this is (%hesitation%) too too much (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) an obligation and not because you you really do want (%hesitation%) to learn
SI114J-00672-P50019 1 SI114J-00672 0.00 11.61 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that currently the best way for (%hesitation%) to find out international news is (%hesitation%) is social medias
SI114J-00672-P50019 1 SI114J-00672 11.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) in fact twitter is a is a good international newspaper

SI114J-00672-P50020 1 SI114J-00672 2.02 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) when (%hesitation%) when to arrive (%hesitation%) the moment (%hesitation%) everybody now will now to use (%hesitation%) online newspaper

SI114J-00672-P50021 1 SI114J-00672 2.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) currently i believe that the social media (%hesitation%) are the most international newspaper because you you can (%hesitation%) you can know (%hesitation%) every

SI114J-00677-P40018 1 SI114J-00677 5.80 12.18 <o,Q5,C,P4> as we can see this flow diagram the main producer for the honey are bees and flowers

SI114J-00677-P40018 1 SI114J-00677 17.95 21.89 <o,Q5,C,P4> then the bees will make honey from nectar in beehives

SI114J-00695-P10007 1 SI114J-00695 15.05 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) even he is a little old man but he has
SI114J-00695-P10008 1 SI114J-00695 0.00 6.91 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm absolutely agree with that because in the future it's important to know english
SI114J-00695-P10008 1 SI114J-00695 6.91 11.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> especially that is gonna help you when you have to speak with the people around the world
SI114J-00695-P10008 1 SI114J-00695 11.68 16.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it's the language more speak in business places the english
SI114J-00695-P10008 1 SI114J-00695 16.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and everyone knows speak english so this is relevant

SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 5.99 10.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> because not everyone are able or capable to learn a new language
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 10.78 12.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> of course they ought to do it
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 12.95 25.93 <o,Q5,C,P3> but it's really difficult for (%hesitation%) lot of people here just to have the skills even the knowledge even the strength to learn a new language
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 25.93 34.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in this warring globalisation world that everyone knows speak english at least i think the idea (%hesitation%) would be really useful
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 34.57 36.60 <o,Q5,C,P3> there are many advantages of that
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 36.60 40.86 <o,Q5,C,P3> in the first of all that the people could finish the degree
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 40.86 48.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) they would be able to speak and communicate in english or in another language with the rest of the people
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 48.56 58.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage is that it maybe soon stressful stressful for a lot of or most of the students when they're not able to learn a new language
SI114J-00695-P30017 1 SI114J-00695 58.30 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> it's not the same as learn another (sub-)
SI114J-00695-P50019 1 SI114J-00695 0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> from my point of view there are many ways to know about international news (esp-) especially when we have our phones or a computer that you can find all the information in the whole variety of newspaper that we have
SI114J-00695-P50019 1 SI114J-00695 14.13 19.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that is really crucial that you only have to (%hesitation%) live just in one newspaper
SI114J-00695-P50019 1 SI114J-00695 19.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to look
SI114J-00695-P50020 1 SI114J-00695 0.00 4.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm absolutely agree with that
SI114J-00695-P50020 1 SI114J-00695 4.38 5.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> why
SI114J-00695-P50020 1 SI114J-00695 5.16 13.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because we are living in a society that is developing little by little with the technology things and everyone have a mobile a mobile phone in their hand
SI114J-00695-P50020 1 SI114J-00695 13.64 18.15 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) it's easier just to find information and even the news
SI114J-00695-P50020 1 SI114J-00695 18.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you've got all the things with a
SI114J-00695-P50021 1 SI114J-00695 0.00 5.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> from my point of view the both are differing a lot between them
SI114J-00695-P50021 1 SI114J-00695 5.53 14.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think that the social media you cannot just (%hesitation%) trust them in the same time as social news

SI114J-00695-P50022 1 SI114J-00695 2.90 18.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that is really really important and crucial to know because if you want to to know what's happening in your local place in the cities or in your village in your towns in all the places it's it's it's crucial to to get information by the local news
SI114J-00695-P50022 1 SI114J-00695 18.02 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because not all the national news

SI114J-00695-P50023 1 SI114J-00695 4.57 17.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> of course the the the the things that is happening around the world and is happening in your in your place and happening in your your in your countries it's it's happening bad news and bad things and we should know
SI114J-00695-P50023 1 SI114J-00695 17.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we ought to know and we have to keep informated about

SI114J-00696-P10008 1 SI114J-00696 11.05 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) most concretely like investigator on a big company where i
SI114J-00696-P30017 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 10.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the one hand there are advantage like improve your skills to get a job in a future
SI114J-00696-P30017 1 SI114J-00696 10.00 17.23 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and obviously get experience is a advantage too
SI114J-00696-P30017 1 SI114J-00696 17.23 34.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there are disadvantage like (%hesitation%) such as (%hesitation%) lack of time to study your your degree and your subjects

SI114J-00696-P30017 1 SI114J-00696 50.27 59.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion students have to study and then they could work

SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 5.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> firstly firstly you have to travel to the airport
SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 5.57 18.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you're here you have to check in when you leave your your suitcase
SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 18.95 27.35 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you have to take your documents to pass the document control and then security control
SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 27.35 39.13 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that you wait (%hesitation%) and you can eat something in in a bar
SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 39.13 51.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can go to the toilet before the flight and could also buy something or have a coffee
SI114J-00696-P40018 1 SI114J-00696 51.79 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> finally you board on a plane and wait to take off
SI114J-00696-P50019 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 16.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the students could use technology for example to take notes more quickly than on paper and to share his homework with the teacher
SI114J-00696-P50019 1 SI114J-00696 16.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and then they could
SI114J-00696-P50020 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 11.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion could be a good option because the student will be more comfortable with only the professors teacher
SI114J-00696-P50020 1 SI114J-00696 11.70 18.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and the teacher don't have to look after a lot of students too
SI114J-00696-P50020 1 SI114J-00696 18.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and have mo
SI114J-00696-P50021 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> work in group is important because you can improve your skills like such as (emp-) empathy and comparation which is so important in a in a job world
SI114J-00696-P50022 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion not because i think it's more easy than that you could read alone and pay attention only for you book only for the paper the words is
SI114J-00696-P50023 1 SI114J-00696 0.00 12.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it's so important because because nowadays the technology is growing up and also the students
SI114J-00696-P50023 1 SI114J-00696 12.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so modern learning facilities make them so easy studied
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 0.00 8.55 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so you can see this diagram show us which is the process to travel by airplane
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 8.55 20.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the first thing that we have to do is travel to the airport and maybe is a good idea to take an uber or go by a public bus or something like that
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 20.07 29.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then we should do the check in and we have to give to the receptionist the tickets
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 29.09 40.45 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then we have to give the documentation and they should check it and if there are ok then we will pass to the security
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 40.45 43.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and he will look our luggage
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 43.91 50.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then we should wait like two hours until the door are open
SI114J-00701-P40018 1 SI114J-00701 50.42 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (w-) we can go travel free and have fun
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 0.00 7.30 <o,Q3,C,P4> well we all know that actually honey comes from bees but how that happen actually
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 7.30 17.84 <o,Q3,C,P4> well it happen that bees collect nectars from flowers then they go back to the beehives where they just (%hesitation%) make honey from the from this nectar
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 17.84 21.99 <o,Q3,C,P4> after that the beekeepers collect honey from the beehives
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 21.99 26.84 <o,Q3,C,P4> and they prepare it in order to package it in some pot in containers
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 26.84 32.89 <o,Q3,C,P4> the containers are brought using (%hesitation%) different means of transportation
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 32.89 38.31 <o,Q3,C,P4> they are brought to stores when they are put in shelves and they're sold
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 38.31 47.86 <o,Q3,C,P4> all this is quite (%hesitation%) easy in the end and nowadays the only real (qu-) issue is to keep bees
SI114J-00703-P40018 1 SI114J-00703 47.86 60.00 <o,Q3,C,P4> because of the global warming there are problems with bees that are about to be wiped out
SI114J-00710-P40018 1 SI114J-00710 0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> factories and vehicles create pollution that relieve (%hesitation%) acid particles in the air
SI114J-00710-P40018 1 SI114J-00710 10.52 26.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and these acid particles are carried (%hesitation%) carried by the wind and some particles fall as dust but some other particles mix (%hesitation%) with (%hesitation%) with the cloud water
SI114J-00710-P40018 1 SI114J-00710 26.97 46.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when it rains (%hesitation%) acid particle in the rain falls on the earth and can and they could be dangerous for (%hesitation%) our environment for example for our trees for (%hesitation%) plants
SI114J-00710-P40018 1 SI114J-00710 46.95 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) so we need to reduce the air pollution

SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 8.71 10.84 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) look at this diagram
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 10.84 16.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this diagram shows the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 16.66 27.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first (%hesitation%) you go to the airplane by public transportation or (%hesitation%) by your driving
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 27.18 34.44 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then when you arrive the airport you need to check in at the check in counter
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 34.44 42.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then when the check in is done (%hesitation%) you need to go document control and security
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 42.55 50.28 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after the security you have free time to wait by boarding
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 50.28 55.53 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then when the boarding time is come you can board to the airplane
SI114J-00713-P40018 1 SI114J-00713 55.53 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that the airplane is take off from the airport
SI114J-00716-P10005 1 SI114J-00716 0.00 5.99 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it is a very important (%hesitation%) topic for me
SI114J-00716-P10005 1 SI114J-00716 5.99 14.21 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i think that (%hesitation%) people (%hesitation%) have to concern self by the environment
SI114J-00716-P10005 1 SI114J-00716 14.21 20.04 <o,Q5,B1,P1> because (%hesitation%) pollution for example pollution or how it

SI114J-00727-P40018 1 SI114J-00727 14.99 23.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you when once you're there you need to check in and present your ticket

SI114J-00727-P40018 1 SI114J-00727 36.10 44.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> then this you will have you will need to pass a security guy or woman that will check your bag
SI114J-00727-P40018 1 SI114J-00727 44.78 52.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you just need to wait until your plane gets out of the airplane of the airport
SI114J-00727-P40018 1 SI114J-00727 52.88 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you just need to boarding and the airplane will fly

SI114J-00729-P10007 1 SI114J-00729 0.00 8.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i would like to meet (%hesitation%) one of my one of my favourite actress that is jennifer aniston
SI114J-00729-P10007 1 SI114J-00729 8.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> she played the role of rachel in (%hesitation%) friends and i loved her role and i (%hesitation%) really like her personality (%hesitation%) as she is
SI114J-00729-P10008 1 SI114J-00729 0.00 10.28 <o,Q4,B2,P1> speak english is helping me right now like i tell it is helping me to communicate with people who don't understand my language
SI114J-00729-P10008 1 SI114J-00729 10.28 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it is going to help me in the future if i wanna you know be an international (%hesitation%) global fashion designer
SI114J-00729-P30017 1 SI114J-00729 0.00 26.12 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) if we are talking about one you know second language for every student i would say they should learn a foreign language at least one language which has you know value globally which will help them to communicate with those who are who can't understand their own language
SI114J-00729-P30017 1 SI114J-00729 26.12 41.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so it is advantageous for students that to know a foreign language you know helps them to add up a new (%hesitation%) attain a new knowledge that they will have
SI114J-00729-P30017 1 SI114J-00729 41.92 52.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but sometimes for some students they feel that the foreign language is much cooler than the before the their own language
SI114J-00729-P30017 1 SI114J-00729 52.20 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion they should learn a foreign language just for communication purpose
SI114J-00729-P50019 1 SI114J-00729 0.00 4.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the best way is the internet or the social media
SI114J-00729-P50019 1 SI114J-00729 4.55 13.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because international news is something which is you know (%hesitation%) less in the national newspapers
SI114J-00729-P50019 1 SI114J-00729 13.35 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so internet is the best way to know about global news

SI114J-00729-P50021 1 SI114J-00729 5.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but most of the time i would say social media is a relevant place to you know know any news where they sometimes to make it interesting or (s-) to just to spice it up they (for-)

SI114J-00729-P50023 1 SI114J-00729 4.38 12.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but it is true that (%hesitation%) media always provide the bad newses first and then the good news
SI114J-00729-P50023 1 SI114J-00729 12.54 18.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i feel the ratio of bad news is more than the good news because you know oh i don't know

SI114J-00731-P10007 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 11.17 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well it's a tricky question but if i had to choose i would go for for angelina jolie because she is a very good actress
SI114J-00731-P10007 1 SI114J-00731 11.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i would ask her (%hesitation%) lots of things such as how how difficult is to be famous
SI114J-00731-P10008 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 4.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well as i said before i am an english teacher

SI114J-00731-P30017 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 8.20 <o,Q5,C,P3> nowadays there is no doubt that being bilingual plays an important role in our society
SI114J-00731-P30017 1 SI114J-00731 8.20 31.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in connection with the pros (%hesitation%) i would like to highlight that those students who who can speak more than one language while they are in the university degree (%hesitation%) could have more opportunities when if they decide to go abroad for example
SI114J-00731-P30017 1 SI114J-00731 31.45 46.25 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) with regard to the cons (%hesitation%) it is important to mention that they they have to study a lot very hard and be motivated

SI114J-00731-P50019 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> regarding the question i would recommend the students to to look for the international news in some social media such as (%hesitation%) facebook and digital newspaper that they can find on the internet as well
SI114J-00731-P50020 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 2.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i feel that way too
SI114J-00731-P50020 1 SI114J-00731 2.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i i strongly believe that the newspaper will be only will be only on the internet so not in paper as in the in the last few decades
SI114J-00731-P50021 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 13.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that's right (%hesitation%) because everybody take (%hesitation%) day by day the social media in order to to know what is happening around the planet
SI114J-00731-P50021 1 SI114J-00731 13.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) however we have to take to be care of where we are
SI114J-00731-P50022 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> speaking from my personal experience i would say that (%hesitation%) knowing what is happening in in our in our cities or towns it's really important because it can it can help you to understand
SI114J-00731-P50023 1 SI114J-00731 0.00 16.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i feel that way too because when i switch on the television (%hesitation%) i i sometimes see (%hesitation%) most of the times i i see that most of the news are not are not very good
SI114J-00731-P50023 1 SI114J-00731 16.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i totally agree with
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 0.00 9.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this diagram represent the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 9.52 16.11 <o,Q4,B2,P4> at first we can travel to airport by train by car or by bus
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 16.11 18.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's better use public transport
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 18.71 30.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when we are inside to airport we will go to a table where there is an employee that check in our luggage
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 30.16 41.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) we will (%hesitation%) present our document control and we will pass the security control
SI114J-00733-P40018 1 SI114J-00733 41.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> finally we can wait have a coffee until are called to get on get up on the board and will enjoy the trip
SI114J-00734-P10005 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 8.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am highly interested in the environment because i think we have to take care of our planet
SI114J-00734-P10005 1 SI114J-00734 8.15 10.78 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we have to reduce our contamination
SI114J-00734-P10005 1 SI114J-00734 10.78 15.07 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we have to recycle all the things that we use every day
SI114J-00734-P10005 1 SI114J-00734 15.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and it is very important for our future to look for them
SI114J-00734-P10006 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 11.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> oh we love to hang out and have a drink you know take some beer take some beers and talk about our life
SI114J-00734-P10006 1 SI114J-00734 11.00 16.35 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and sometimes we really like to go hikings to the mountains
SI114J-00734-P10006 1 SI114J-00734 16.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think it's really like the environment and the nature
SI114J-00734-P10007 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 10.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think that i look like my mother because we are very talkative we like to talk about everything
SI114J-00734-P10007 1 SI114J-00734 10.63 17.19 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also we love going shopping and go for a walk
SI114J-00734-P10007 1 SI114J-00734 17.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we like to do that things you know
SI114J-00734-P10008 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 13.16 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i am older i would like to live in london with my boyfriend because we have we want to have family together
SI114J-00734-P10008 1 SI114J-00734 13.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and we are studying the same thing so it could be possible i (supp-) i suppose
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 11.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of the advantages is that do exercise is very important for our health
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 11.21 25.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if the students do exercise during the day in the school they don't have to do it when they are out of schools and have time to do their homework
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 25.02 28.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so that is good for them
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 28.46 45.69 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but one of the disadvantages is that if there not space for for the people (%hesitation%) to take off their (clo-) their clothes maybe it's a little bit uncomfortable to do exercise
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 45.69 48.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and then you are wet and maybe it is not good for you
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 48.86 51.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you smell bad and other things
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 51.71 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion it is a good thing to do exercise in the school but if the school it is prepare for that
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 5.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well i am going to talk about how honey is produced
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 5.63 10.44 <o,Q4,B2,P4> at first bees collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 10.44 18.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) it is a very natural process where the bees make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 18.89 38.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they have to be in calm and quiet because if the if they feel some danger around them it could be (%hesitation%) na dangerous for the beekeepers that are collecting honey from beehives
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 38.34 45.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but they prepare for them so i don't think so it is (%hesitation%) really problem
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 45.74 50.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so then they put the the honey inside a pot
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 50.80 58.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that that pots are delivery for our supermarkets where we buy them
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 58.83 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and we
SI114J-00734-P50019 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 16.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if i were a student going abroad i will try to look for a country that it is not very expensive so i can afford an apartment to live in
SI114J-00734-P50019 1 SI114J-00734 16.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and then the life is not very (s-)
SI114J-00734-P50020 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well if you study in a second language you will learn a lot of things about that that languages
SI114J-00734-P50020 1 SI114J-00734 10.52 13.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you will meet a lot of people
SI114J-00734-P50020 1 SI114J-00734 13.55 15.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe you'll get on well with them
SI114J-00734-P50020 1 SI114J-00734 15.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (s-) (%hesitation%) you will learn the customs what they do
SI114J-00734-P50021 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 8.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well studying alone in a country that you don't know it is always difficult
SI114J-00734-P50021 1 SI114J-00734 8.35 13.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you you have to live by yourself and maybe this is difficult
SI114J-00734-P50021 1 SI114J-00734 13.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) maybe the lifestyles and the customs are a little annoying for
SI114J-00734-P50022 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 5.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well a students would meet a lot of people
SI114J-00734-P50022 1 SI114J-00734 5.93 11.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) that people they teach how they live
SI114J-00734-P50022 1 SI114J-00734 11.44 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so if you go if you go to a lot of parties and celebrations that they make you will learn a lot a lot (o-)
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 0.00 7.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i really agree that because you are studying without your parents
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 7.79 12.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (n-) your parents your parents are not with a with you
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 12.84 14.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you have to do all the things
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 14.71 17.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to tidy up your room
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 17.07 18.80 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to do your lunch
SI114J-00734-P50023 1 SI114J-00734 18.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you have to do a lot of
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 0.00 6.85 <o,Q5,B2,P4> do you know how (%hesitation%) pollution causes acid rain
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 6.85 17.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well this diagram shows (%hesitation%) the mechanism of (%hesitation%) acid rain
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 17.42 25.38 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first pollution is emitted from factories and vehicles
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 25.38 38.17 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) asto particles are included in smoke and then (%hesitation%) those particles are carried by wind
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 38.17 46.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that (%hesitation%) (th-) (th-) those particles are mixed with cloud water
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 46.27 55.76 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) those particles are participated (%hesitation%) precipitated in rain or snow
SI114J-00747-P40018 1 SI114J-00747 55.76 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally it causes damage to environment
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 0.00 6.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) today i will be talking about how pollution causes acid rain
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 6.65 12.78 <o,Q5,B2,P4> factories and vehicles emit a lot of smoke which causes pollution
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 12.78 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the acid particles are all in the smoke emitted by these factories and vehicles
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 19.95 24.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by wind
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 24.23 30.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> thereafter these acid particles fall as dust
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 30.52 41.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> on the other hand some of the acid particles mix with cloud water and this is where it causes rain or snow
SI114J-00755-P40018 1 SI114J-00755 41.33 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these acid particles which turn into rain or snow will then cause acid rain which is completely detrimental to the environment
SI114J-00756-P10005 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm not interested in learning about other countries but i think that is interesting for our lives to know other cultures other religions other things that happen in other countries
SI114J-00756-P10006 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i spend my free time doing gym and playing playstation but more time learning english
SI114J-00756-P10007 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> practise all the days in speaking reading writing listening
SI114J-00756-P10008 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i could learn another skill i think that i probably choose to learn another language such as chinese
SI114J-00756-P30017 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 34.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first i think that the advantages are that students could combine studying and working because if they have work with time complete they couldn't study their degrees
SI114J-00756-P30017 1 SI114J-00756 34.24 48.34 <o,Q4,B2,P3> second the disadvantage is i think that could be (%hesitation%) less time to dedicate to study
SI114J-00756-P30017 1 SI114J-00756 48.34 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and my own opinion i think that if i could study only only study i think that it's better
SI114J-00756-P40018 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) when factories produce the polluting gases (%hesitation%) these gases or acid particles are in the smoke of these factories
SI114J-00756-P40018 1 SI114J-00756 19.60 25.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then these go up to the atmosphere
SI114J-00756-P40018 1 SI114J-00756 25.41 38.39 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and there (%hesitation%) in this place the acid particles (%hesitation%) can carried by wind and do twos things
SI114J-00756-P40018 1 SI114J-00756 38.39 48.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) one of these is that they can fall as dust to the superfice
SI114J-00756-P40018 1 SI114J-00756 48.24 60.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and other acid particles mix with cloud water and fall in form of rain or snow and damage the environment
SI114J-00756-P50019 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that they could eat more legumes and fruit and don't eat (%hesitation%) fast food
SI114J-00756-P50020 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that drink a lot of water is important for our metabolism and (%hesitation%) to have water than we lost (%hesitation%) most day
SI114J-00756-P50021 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion i think that doing exercise every day is important for our personal development and for our muscles and for create an habit good
SI114J-00756-P50022 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that sleep eight hours (%hesitation%) per day and per night i think that is important for create an habit of healthy and good practise
SI114J-00756-P50023 1 SI114J-00756 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that i need we need to control the technology because if they the technology control us (%hesitation%) we can do habits unhealthy and doing negative practice for us
SI114J-00761-P10005 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 13.36 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i am very interested in in music especially classical music and pop music (%hesitation%) every kind of genre
SI114J-00761-P10005 1 SI114J-00761 13.36 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and well without music life is very dull for me
SI114J-00761-P10006 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> well (%hesitation%) before the spread of coronavirus i often (%hesitation%) go travelling but recently i seldom going out
SI114J-00761-P10007 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> well this is a very difficult question because i have a lot of people i'd like to meet but well buddha and steve jobs for the already positive way that they are very appealing to me
SI114J-00761-P10008 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 10.65 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it will help me to broaden my (%hesitation%) scope of (%hesitation%) work
SI114J-00761-P10008 1 SI114J-00761 10.65 17.08 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm mainly doing translation of the written document
SI114J-00761-P10008 1 SI114J-00761 17.08 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> but in the future i would like to try to
SI114J-00761-P30017 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 23.67 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i thinks (%hesitation%) there a lot of lot of advantages (%hesitation%) including (%hesitation%) gain gain a wider variety of (ex-) (%hesitation%) knowledge that you cannot (%hesitation%) obtain from only your mother tongue
SI114J-00761-P30017 1 SI114J-00761 23.67 34.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i don't believe there is any (disad-) disadvantages (%hesitation%) learning (%hesitation%) second languages
SI114J-00761-P30017 1 SI114J-00761 34.30 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so my opinion that (%hesitation%) you have to (lea-) you have to learn as many as foreign language is possible to improve your (%hesitation%) knowledge
SI114J-00761-P50019 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 14.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think in the advent of the internet this is the most (%hesitation%) useful and convenient source to gather information on international news
SI114J-00761-P50019 1 SI114J-00761 14.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> compared to the internet tv is (%hesitation%) less (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00761-P50020 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i don't think so (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) electronic newspaper is more (com-) it started getting popular but still there are a definite (%hesitation%) demand for the paper based
SI114J-00761-P50021 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 16.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i guess (%hesitation%) some are reliable but there are a lot of of fake news (%hesitation%) posted on the internet
SI114J-00761-P50021 1 SI114J-00761 16.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so we should be very careful about
SI114J-00761-P50022 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 19.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it is also very (%hesitation%) important to keep up with local news because we need to know about our (%hesitation%) close environment
SI114J-00761-P50022 1 SI114J-00761 19.09 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so
SI114J-00761-P50023 1 SI114J-00761 0.00 7.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes it's true because (%hesitation%) there are a lot of (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00761-P50023 1 SI114J-00761 7.05 8.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> without
SI114J-00761-P50023 1 SI114J-00761 8.23 13.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think bad news is too common
SI114J-00761-P50023 1 SI114J-00761 13.12 17.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean without bad news there's no news
SI114J-00761-P50023 1 SI114J-00761 17.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so yes i agree with
SI114J-00765-P30017 1 SI114J-00765 0.00 27.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) the advantages are that the people are more (in-) more they are more fit because (%hesitation%) nobody wants to to (fa-) fall the subject and (%hesitation%) the the (s-) subject (%hesitation%) should be compulsory
SI114J-00765-P30017 1 SI114J-00765 27.20 55.25 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and disadvantages i think that the (%hesitation%) there are people that (%hesitation%) don't like this subject and if they you need the school (%hesitation%) they are in shower (%hesitation%) in the rest of the day (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) the people have a a smell a funny smells

SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 0.00 6.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first the bees (%hesitation%) collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 6.23 16.07 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) they go to the beehives and the bees made make honey from nectar in beehives
SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 16.07 23.94 <o,Q4,B2,P4> later the worker or (be-) beekeepers (col-) collect honey from the (be-) beehives
SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 23.94 32.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they put this this this honey in in bottles
SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 32.43 56.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) then they they put the bottles in a car and she he and the worker (%hesitation%) drive this quad (%hesitation%) this one and (%hesitation%) she co he carry the honey to the shops
SI114J-00765-P40018 1 SI114J-00765 56.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and there i sell he
SI114J-00767-P10005 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 15.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> since i was a kid i was always interested in history and (g-) and geography and i was always looking forward to learn more about other countries and cultures and how they live (%hesitation%) and their language
SI114J-00767-P10005 1 SI114J-00767 15.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> overall i'm pretty interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00767-P10006 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 7.80 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i usually play some video games or (%hesitation%) check my social media news feed
SI114J-00767-P10006 1 SI114J-00767 7.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but if the weather is extraordinary and (%hesitation%) (ha-) it's (%hesitation%) really it had (%hesitation%) really good weather i would rather go out and do some activities or play some sports
SI114J-00767-P10007 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 11.82 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my opinion one of the best ways to improve my english is to take (%hesitation%) a lot of courses and watch (%hesitation%) english movies with no subtitles
SI114J-00767-P10007 1 SI114J-00767 11.82 16.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think this will really improve my accent grammar and vocabulary overall

SI114J-00767-P10008 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 14.13 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really want to (%hesitation%) learn the communication skill or to be able to communicate better because i think i really like this skill in my social and educational life
SI114J-00767-P10008 1 SI114J-00767 14.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think i really need to improve and gain the communication skill
SI114J-00767-P30017 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 20.85 <o,Q4,B2,P3> having a part time job as a university student will really help you in (%hesitation%) like paying the bills and being able to afford many things you need for university or for living like food and and like (%hesitation%) and like buying new things to treat yourself
SI114J-00767-P30017 1 SI114J-00767 20.85 30.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but it might also have some disadvantages like (%hesitation%) you won't be able to have enough time to study or meet people
SI114J-00767-P30017 1 SI114J-00767 30.50 41.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> or like it's not really that helpful educational wise but it will also give you so much experience that you will need
SI114J-00767-P30017 1 SI114J-00767 41.06 54.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's really fun to (%hesitation%) it's it will be a really good experience and everyone should at least try to have a part time job even if they don't like it they need to try it
SI114J-00767-P30017 1 SI114J-00767 54.29 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> at the end it will it will mostly benefit them
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in this presentation i will explain how acid rain is formed
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 6.79 15.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all there needs to be pollution so pollution is formed by factories vehicles (%hesitation%) et cetera
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 15.96 35.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when the when this pollution or polluted air comes out of the vehicles and factories those acid particles are flown into the air (%hesitation%) as smoke flown into the air and carried by wind and it it gets mixed up with clouds
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 35.24 42.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> or and and in those clouds the acid is mixed with some cloud water
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 42.33 52.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when the acid is mixed with the cloud water acid rain particles are acid particles are are now in rain or the snow
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 52.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when it rains it will damage the environment or the surrounding (%hesitation%) trees
SI114J-00767-P50019 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 8.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i really advise them to eat what they want but in small (%hesitation%) small parts
SI114J-00767-P50019 1 SI114J-00767 8.61 16.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so like taking some of (what-) whatever they want and (%hesitation%) eating it in small amounts
SI114J-00767-P50019 1 SI114J-00767 16.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that way they'll always be able to stay fit and (heal-)
SI114J-00767-P50020 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 13.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's really important to drink a lot of water like really really important coz it is (%hesitation%) water is needed for some vital organ organs like the liver the brain
SI114J-00767-P50020 1 SI114J-00767 13.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) in general it helps you stay (th-) (%hesitation%) stay fit throughout the day and be
SI114J-00767-P50021 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 6.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no i don't really think (e-) (ek-) exercise is needed (%hesitation%) on a daily basis
SI114J-00767-P50021 1 SI114J-00767 6.97 18.31 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00767-P50021 1 SI114J-00767 18.31 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so exercising two
SI114J-00767-P50022 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 17.37 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think i agree with people saying that everyone needs eight hours of sleep every night coz without sleeping many functions of the body and the brain won't really be (%hesitation%) won't really function the same way it is functioning
SI114J-00767-P50022 1 SI114J-00767 17.37 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) yeah sleeping is really (impor-)
SI114J-00767-P50023 1 SI114J-00767 0.00 7.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion technology has had a pretty negative effect on people's lives
SI114J-00767-P50023 1 SI114J-00767 7.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because now like rather than people going out and having a walk or going to the gym or doing any activity they would rather just stay on their (%hesitation%) smartphone or (compu-)
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 0.00 1.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> good afternoon
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 1.91 8.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> today i am going to explain this drag diagram about the acid rain
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 8.66 21.50 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first (%hesitation%) the factories and the vehicles expeed a lot of air and this air is very nocive to the air
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 21.50 24.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is basic the pollution
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 24.66 31.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the pollution create acid particulars that are in the smoke
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 31.77 37.17 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then these particulars carried by the wind and i two options
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 37.17 48.16 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) some particulars acid mix with cloud water and produce the rain and another somes acid particulars fall as dust
SI114J-00769-P40018 1 SI114J-00769 48.16 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and all particulars by the acid rain are very dangerous because they cause the death of the animals and the trees
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 0.00 15.79 <o,Q5,B1,P4> if you want to travel by airplane (%hesitation%) the first of all you travel to airport by car or train or public transport
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 15.79 22.17 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) next (%hesitation%) you should pass in check in
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 22.17 30.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> next you should round your document at document control
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 30.91 40.96 <o,Q5,B1,P4> next (%hesitation%) you should wait at the hall at the airport
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 40.96 53.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> for example (%hesitation%) you should (%hesitation%) eat some biscuit or chocolates and you drink some coffee
SI114J-00774-P40018 1 SI114J-00774 53.91 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally you board and travel by airplane
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 0.00 6.44 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this diagram shows the steps to travelling by airplane
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 6.44 10.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first of all you have to travel to the airport
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 10.11 17.73 <o,Q5,B1,P4> you could (%hesitation%) go with car with bus with metro
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 17.73 30.21 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) you will arrive at the airport and go for a check in
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 30.21 37.47 <o,Q5,B1,P4> to do the check in you will need your personal identification
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 37.47 44.43 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then pass a document control and security
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 44.43 55.39 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it's not be able to wear liquids or scissor or things related
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 55.39 56.78 <o,Q5,B1,P4> wait
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 56.78 58.35 <o,Q5,B1,P4> board
SI114J-00777-P40018 1 SI114J-00777 58.35 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and fly
SI114J-00783-P10005 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 5.86 <o,Q3,A2,P1> it's very terrible the pollution of environment
SI114J-00783-P10005 1 SI114J-00783 5.86 12.61 <o,Q3,A2,P1> it damage animal trees lake oceans
SI114J-00783-P10005 1 SI114J-00783 12.61 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> i afraid this damage from pollution or
SI114J-00783-P10006 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 6.54 <o,Q3,A2,P1> we usually go to the mountain when we have free time
SI114J-00783-P10006 1 SI114J-00783 6.54 13.02 <o,Q3,A2,P1> we hinking hunting (%hesitation%) or fish in a lake
SI114J-00783-P10006 1 SI114J-00783 13.02 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> and then at the night we sleep at a tent
SI114J-00783-P10007 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 11.59 <o,Q3,A2,P1> my oldest daughter is like me because she has blonde hair and blue eyes
SI114J-00783-P10007 1 SI114J-00783 11.59 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> and her personality and charact is very hard with like me
SI114J-00783-P10008 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 7.58 <o,Q3,A2,P1> in the future i would like to live in malaga because it's never snowy
SI114J-00783-P10008 1 SI114J-00783 7.58 12.38 <o,Q3,A2,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it has a good weather
SI114J-00783-P10008 1 SI114J-00783 12.38 16.01 <o,Q3,A2,P1> there are job opportunities
SI114J-00783-P10008 1 SI114J-00783 16.01 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> they there are
SI114J-00783-P30017 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 7.62 <o,Q3,A2,P3> nowadays students must doing exercise at school
SI114J-00783-P30017 1 SI114J-00783 7.62 25.83 <o,Q3,A2,P3> they can improve all relation skill improve they (%hesitation%) cyclomotor skill
SI114J-00783-P30017 1 SI114J-00783 25.83 33.61 <o,Q3,A2,P3> (%hesitation%) they can play in groups
SI114J-00783-P30017 1 SI114J-00783 33.61 47.95 <o,Q3,A2,P3> but the disadvantage is maybe they learn play with other people and they have less time to study and less time less free time
SI114J-00783-P30017 1 SI114J-00783 47.95 60.04 <o,Q3,A2,P3> in my opinion it's very essential and very important doing exercise to avoid sedentary lifestyle and to avoid disease in the
SI114J-00783-P40018 1 SI114J-00783 0.00 18.64 <o,Q3,A2,P4> the following instagram show how honey it's produced until to the shop
SI114J-00783-P40018 1 SI114J-00783 18.64 31.84 <o,Q3,A2,P4> well first bees collect nectar from flower and they transport this nectar to beehives
SI114J-00783-P40018 1 SI114J-00783 31.84 34.72 <o,Q3,A2,P4> there bees make honey
SI114J-00783-P40018 1 SI114J-00783 34.72 40.10 <o,Q3,A2,P4> then beekeeper collect honey from beehive
SI114J-00783-P40018 1 SI114J-00783 40.10 60.04 <o,Q3,A2,P4> and this honey get into the bottle and transport it to the to the shop for selling
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 0.00 4.32 <o,Q5,B1,P4> if you if you have to travel in a plane it is very easy
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 4.32 8.61 <o,Q5,B1,P4> but first of all you have to know how to travel to our airport
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 8.61 12.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> you can go by car by train or by bus
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 12.88 26.41 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after that when you gets in (%hesitation%) you get on at the airport in this place you have to make the check in and pass the documents control and the security
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 26.41 35.32 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after all this (s-) steps you can wait in a park or you can go to a toilet if it is necessary
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 35.32 48.53 <o,Q5,B1,P4> when is the time to the plane take off you have to board and go on to the plane
SI114J-00795-P40018 1 SI114J-00795 48.53 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the plane take off and you will have a good flight
SI114J-00797-P10005 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 5.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the place where i live (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) oviedo
SI114J-00797-P10005 1 SI114J-00797 5.79 14.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i live the city in the north of spain in the community called asturias
SI114J-00797-P10005 1 SI114J-00797 14.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's a beautiful city
SI114J-00797-P10006 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my holidays i enjoy very much (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) watching movies (%hesitation%) playing games (%hesitation%) video games and have a beer with my friends

SI114J-00797-P10007 1 SI114J-00797 11.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i i i have some hobbies in common
SI114J-00797-P10008 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to to get (%hesitation%) a job relation (%hesitation%) with relationship to new technologies and (%hesitation%) internet kind of things et cetera
SI114J-00797-P30017 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 18.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) that students (%hesitation%) get jobs (%hesitation%) to pay their university studies is (%hesitation%) the perfect way (%hesitation%) to to know (%hesitation%) environment of a companies
SI114J-00797-P30017 1 SI114J-00797 18.18 41.97 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but i think it (%hesitation%) can be to a disadvance (%hesitation%) because sometimes (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) can (%hesitation%) do (%hesitation%) or be a distraction (%hesitation%) to to get (%hesitation%) the main goal
SI114J-00797-P30017 1 SI114J-00797 41.97 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but in my opinion it's (%hesitation%) a perfect way (%hesitation%) to to get (%hesitation%) a better future in a company
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 8.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the steps (%hesitation%) to travelling by airplane are the next
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 8.38 17.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first (%hesitation%) you you have to travel to airport in differents (%hesitation%) media transports
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 17.54 25.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) once in airport (%hesitation%) you have to check in and pass a document control
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 25.05 34.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then the authorities of aeroport (%hesitation%) have to control security about your baggage
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 34.91 49.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) once passed this item (%hesitation%) you have to to wait a time (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to board (%hesitation%) in the (air-) the in the in the plane
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 49.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is all
SI114J-00797-P50019 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think technology is very useful to the students because it let (%hesitation%) them (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) attending lectures in remote and record the classes and research (%hesitation%) more information in in less time
SI114J-00797-P50020 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't (a-) agree with it (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) face to face (%hesitation%) is very (%hesitation%) very close and don't (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) let (%hesitation%) other options other (ti-)
SI114J-00797-P50021 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> a lot of skills (%hesitation%) for example (%hesitation%) be more empathy (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to learn (%hesitation%) (oth-) the other partner and to teach other partner and to help in general
SI114J-00797-P50022 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 10.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think attending lectures (%hesitation%) is more (a-) (%hesitation%) effective (%hesitation%) to read alone
SI114J-00797-P50022 1 SI114J-00797 10.43 12.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends on the person
SI114J-00797-P50022 1 SI114J-00797 12.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it has to combine two ways
SI114J-00797-P50023 1 SI114J-00797 0.00 14.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is important because (%hesitation%) learning facilities always (%hesitation%) appear (%hesitation%) more attention and more students
SI114J-00797-P50023 1 SI114J-00797 14.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) is very good to learn (m-) more
SI1267-00010-P10005 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 5.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like music a lot and i'm very interested in it
SI1267-00010-P10005 1 SI1267-00010 5.29 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example my favourite singers are snoop dogg fifty cent and i love listen listening to them coz i feel like i were in a different country
SI1267-00010-P10006 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 12.76 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love going to different places because it can be very funny if you go if you're visiting (%hesitation%) with a couple of friends or with family
SI1267-00010-P10006 1 SI1267-00010 12.76 18.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can learn a lot about different cultures and have different knowledges
SI1267-00010-P10006 1 SI1267-00010 18.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example
SI1267-00010-P10007 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 9.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would really like to meet snoop dogg (%hesitation%) who is my favourite singer all in the world coz i love his music

SI1267-00010-P10008 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 6.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well to begin with i think i could work in a better place
SI1267-00010-P10008 1 SI1267-00010 6.72 10.68 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i could travel to different countries too
SI1267-00010-P10008 1 SI1267-00010 10.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example i would like to go to the united states and to (%hesitation%) japan for
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 6.30 <o,Q3,C,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 6.30 11.92 <o,Q3,C,P3> for example the students make friend from different countries which is a very good point
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 11.92 15.88 <o,Q3,C,P3> (%hesitation%) besides they could be able to work in a better place
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 15.88 26.85 <o,Q3,C,P3> for example if they live in in china they could travel to (%hesitation%) u k and london to earn more money
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 26.85 36.20 <o,Q3,C,P3> and finally it encourage them to learn another language if they didn't want to in the past more or less
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 36.20 43.31 <o,Q3,C,P3> it can be a (ver-) very bad idea because it can stress them if they are no good at the language
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 43.31 60.00 <o,Q3,C,P3> and it could be a very a big problem coz they wouldn't pass their course
SI1267-00010-P50019 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 9.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) to begin with international news can a very good idea to know something about other places and countries
SI1267-00010-P50019 1 SI1267-00010 9.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example (%hesitation%) the tsunami of tokyo (%hesitation%) have been international (new-)
SI1267-00010-P50020 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 16.68 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well we can all agree that the future of newspapers isn't clear a lot at all coz we are using the blogs and the notice in the internet
SI1267-00010-P50020 1 SI1267-00010 16.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and just how
SI1267-00010-P50021 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 9.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well it true that the social media can contain a wide variety of (%hesitation%) interesting information
SI1267-00010-P50021 1 SI1267-00010 9.90 17.10 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but sometimes (%hesitation%) the information can can't be true
SI1267-00010-P50021 1 SI1267-00010 17.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it is not reliable
SI1267-00010-P50022 1 SI1267-00010 0.00 16.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the local news are so important coz if you need any new about the things and the stuff which are happening (%hesitation%) in our places (%hesitation%) we couldn't read properly
SI1267-00010-P50022 1 SI1267-00010 16.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it could (v-) very

SI1267-00010-P50023 1 SI1267-00010 14.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but there're bad news which are fake and it can be very
SI1267-00018-P10005 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 2.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really into music
SI1267-00018-P10005 1 SI1267-00018 2.88 8.11 <o,Q5,C,P1> when i was living in scotland i had my own band
SI1267-00018-P10005 1 SI1267-00018 8.11 17.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) we used to play ska music and we (sh-) used to spend time together every monday afternoon
SI1267-00018-P10005 1 SI1267-00018 17.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> we really enjoyed doing open mikes
SI1267-00018-P10006 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 16.05 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love travelling (%hesitation%) around different countries because i think that it's really important to have a open mind and discover (%hesitation%) about different cultures
SI1267-00018-P10006 1 SI1267-00018 16.05 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love to share time doing it
SI1267-00018-P10007 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 8.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would love to meet lady gaga because i think that she is (%hesitation%) such a character
SI1267-00018-P10007 1 SI1267-00018 8.96 13.80 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love how she organise her performance
SI1267-00018-P10007 1 SI1267-00018 13.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) all the dresses that she is wearing all the time are super
SI1267-00018-P10008 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 18.77 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) to be able to speak english in the future will help me to find a job in spain because i am a teacher and i need (%hesitation%) the english certificate (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to become (%hesitation%) a teacher
SI1267-00018-P10008 1 SI1267-00018 18.77 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) so i
SI1267-00018-P30017 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 12.66 <o,Q5,C,P3> nowadays seems to be mandatory to learn a foreign language while you are studying your university course
SI1267-00018-P30017 1 SI1267-00018 12.66 30.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> studies find that many people who did that get better scores in long term and better results in personal life
SI1267-00018-P30017 1 SI1267-00018 30.30 46.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand i think that you will have to manage your time and be very organised due to you're gonna be very busy and swamped
SI1267-00018-P30017 1 SI1267-00018 46.61 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) as far as i'm concerned to learn a new foreign language will help you and will increase your knowledge
SI1267-00018-P50019 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 13.74 <o,Q5,C,P5> i reckon that the best way to find out international news is on the internet because there you have access to all the information that you need
SI1267-00018-P50019 1 SI1267-00018 13.74 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's true as well that you will have to research properly and find right
SI1267-00018-P50020 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 3.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> i completely agree with this
SI1267-00018-P50020 1 SI1267-00018 3.79 12.29 <o,Q5,C,P5> nowadays we can see how media is (%hesitation%) more in our lives
SI1267-00018-P50020 1 SI1267-00018 12.29 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i actually never buy a newspaper in my life and i am using only my phone
SI1267-00018-P50021 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 1.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> not really
SI1267-00018-P50021 1 SI1267-00018 1.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) social media (%hesitation%) from my point of view is only opinion so you will have to go deeper in internet and find (%hesitation%) the right place to find information
SI1267-00018-P50022 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 9.85 <o,Q5,C,P5> i consider that it's really important to be updated with local news but it's not mandatory
SI1267-00018-P50022 1 SI1267-00018 9.85 18.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> what i mean is that you should be aware of the things that are happening around you
SI1267-00018-P50022 1 SI1267-00018 18.04 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but if you don't it's not
SI1267-00018-P50023 1 SI1267-00018 0.00 3.60 <o,Q5,C,P5> i completely agree with this fact
SI1267-00018-P50023 1 SI1267-00018 3.60 10.58 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) every time that you switch on the tv the only news that you can see are bad news
SI1267-00018-P50023 1 SI1267-00018 10.58 13.08 <o,Q5,C,P5> you're seeing people dying in war
SI1267-00018-P50023 1 SI1267-00018 13.08 17.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> you're seeing (%hesitation%) conflicts all around the world
SI1267-00018-P50023 1 SI1267-00018 17.63 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and we seems that we don't do
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 0.00 11.12 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when the factories are doing their production activity or when we are travelling by the roads with our vehicles generate pollution which can be very nasty for the environment
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 11.12 22.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) this pollution extend to the sky in form of smoke can generate acid particles which can (%hesitation%) (da-) (%hesitation%) extend to the ground in form of a dust or water
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 22.63 38.62 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the first way the acid particles are carried by the wind and extend to the ground in form of dust and can be a little nasty for the fish and and the rest of fauna in the lakes (%hesitation%) and and the environment in the form of water
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 38.62 52.26 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the second way the acid particles mix with the cloud water and generate the phenomenon called (%hesitation%) acid rain which can be very noxive and dangerous for the environment and extend to the ground in form of rain
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 52.26 58.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the forest and the rest of (%hesitation%) the environment can be (%hesitation%) enthreatening
SI1267-00031-P40018 1 SI1267-00031 58.59 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so
SI1267-00037-P10005 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 3.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have a much interest in the music
SI1267-00037-P10005 1 SI1267-00037 3.25 10.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> actually i can play guitar and (%hesitation%) playing the piano and also (%hesitation%) into listening the variety of the music
SI1267-00037-P10005 1 SI1267-00037 10.63 16.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) sometimes i am enjoying to watching the (%hesitation%) musicians in a concert
SI1267-00037-P10005 1 SI1267-00037 16.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like the music very (mu-)
SI1267-00037-P10006 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 10.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i like to drive (%hesitation%) to make a travel to other place so or together with my friend or together with my families
SI1267-00037-P10006 1 SI1267-00037 10.23 16.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) if i have a time (%hesitation%) taking the vehicles to go to other place for travelling
SI1267-00037-P10006 1 SI1267-00037 16.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that very fun
SI1267-00037-P10007 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 4.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i have (%hesitation%) one
SI1267-00037-P10007 1 SI1267-00037 4.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00037-P10008 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 6.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00037-P10008 1 SI1267-00037 6.29 13.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) speaking english is help my jobs to expand or communicate well with our customers
SI1267-00037-P10008 1 SI1267-00037 13.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i need to improve my english more for my business
SI1267-00037-P30017 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 28.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think the advantages to learn (%hesitation%) the at least one foreign language (%hesitation%) yes (%hesitation%) because getting the (%hesitation%) knowledge or the capability to speak or understand a foreign language is (%hesitation%) enable them to to study (%hesitation%) with that language so expand their (%hesitation%) opportunities to learn more issues
SI1267-00037-P30017 1 SI1267-00037 28.62 42.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but if the student (%hesitation%) not (%hesitation%) interested in (%hesitation%) studying it with their foreign language (%hesitation%) if we force them to study the foreign language is just to spend the time
SI1267-00037-P30017 1 SI1267-00037 42.35 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but considering the advantage and disadvantage i still recommend to learn at least one foreign language to expand (%hesitation%) their capability and easy access to foreign world
SI1267-00037-P50019 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way to collect the international news is to watch the tv especially for the b b c or c n n (%hesitation%) that kind of the international news broadcast
SI1267-00037-P50019 1 SI1267-00037 13.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and also to take (%hesitation%) internet to collect the international news
SI1267-00037-P50020 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 18.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i agree because there even now (%hesitation%) many of the peoples is (%hesitation%) not reading the newspapers physically (%hesitation%) just collecting the informations (%hesitation%) of newspapers through the internet (%hesitation%) or the medias
SI1267-00037-P50020 1 SI1267-00037 18.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> or
SI1267-00037-P50021 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 6.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's depend upon totally depend upon which kind of the social media you choose
SI1267-00037-P50021 1 SI1267-00037 6.13 15.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> sometimes it's (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) we can gather or collect the very detailed and professional informations even through the social media
SI1267-00037-P50021 1 SI1267-00037 15.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but sometimes it's (%hesitation%) mixed up the fake news
SI1267-00037-P50022 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) how to keep (%hesitation%) the importance of the local news is just dispatching their (%hesitation%) their valuable sources through the for the peoples local living in the locally
SI1267-00037-P50023 1 SI1267-00037 0.00 7.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also think that (%hesitation%) it's depend upon the interest from the listeners
SI1267-00037-P50023 1 SI1267-00037 7.00 14.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because the bad news will bring more (%hesitation%) effect and the news values to the (%hesitation%) listeners
SI1267-00037-P50023 1 SI1267-00037 14.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that why (%hesitation%) it could be that (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060 0.00 5.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think there are two ways to improve my english
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060 5.42 12.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> first is to making conversations with foreigners
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060 12.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and on the other hand i want to travel around to chat with the local people
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 0.00 10.24 <o,Q4,C,P4> hello guys i'm here to offer you some information about the inclusion of people of customers to the three main (s-) (%hesitation%) pop sites in the city
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 10.24 18.19 <o,Q4,C,P4> okay so starting with tunes net on monday it was the least concra concurred place from all three
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 18.19 26.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) wildly (be-) bewildering on (s-) on tuesday it decreased even more the the population
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 26.57 40.62 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) but from from that day to sunday to saturday to sunday it started growing in a in a established way (%hesitation%) songs four you and leading the position on (%hesitation%) at the top ranking
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 40.62 55.53 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) while songs four you and music now are starting with a with a growth were starting with (%hesitation%) with an average attendance of people and go went decreasing (%hesitation%) through (%hesitation%) throughout through the week throughout the week
SI1267-00068-P40018 1 SI1267-00068 55.53 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> yeah
SI1267-00101-P40018 1 SI1267-00101 0.00 17.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> okay so (%hesitation%) as we can see (%hesitation%) comparing the line yellow and blue both start in the middle of the of the table
SI1267-00101-P40018 1 SI1267-00101 17.91 29.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00101-P40018 1 SI1267-00101 29.39 41.83 <o,Q4,B1,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00101-P40018 1 SI1267-00101 41.83 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) on the contrary the the red line started in the in the low position and finished on the top of of the three lines so this is the winner
SI1267-00104-P10007 1 SI1267-00104 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is speaking it a lot and also seeing series films or listening to the radio in english
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104 0.00 6.15 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would love to have the skill to learn different languages without trouble
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104 6.15 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as i said before i love different cultures which involve languages and for me it would be an amazing skill
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 0.00 7.38 <o,Q4,C,P3> as we all know doing part time jobs while you are studying has some disadvantages but also some advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 7.38 10.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> i would like to start with advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 10.14 20.06 <o,Q4,C,P3> okay so if you think about doing part time jobs while you are studying the first thing that comes to your mind is that you are going to start to experience your life like an adult
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 20.06 30.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> you're going to leave behind your teenage years and start making money saving money and also be more busy during the day
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 30.90 33.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> although there are some disadvantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 33.58 41.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> you are going to lose time of being with your friends practicing some sport or maybe things like that
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 41.42 43.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> also from studying
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 43.64 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i would love to do part time jobs when studying because that way i would spend my own money in everything that i want
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104 0.00 10.44 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course a person can stay woken up (%hesitation%) without sleeping more than eight hours but it affects badly to health
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104 10.44 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> we should sleep eight or more than eight hours every day
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104 0.00 9.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> from my point of view technology has affected in a good way to our mental health but in a mad way to our physical health
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104 9.95 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> because when we are with the mobile phone we do some strain postures we don't sleep as much as we have we don't do exercise
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 4.11 <o,Q4,X,P1> i really enjoy travelling to different places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105 4.11 7.12 <o,Q4,X,P1> is good to know a lot of places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105 7.12 20.00 <o,Q4,X,P1> (%hesitation%) i enjoy more (%hesitation%) nature places where i can go with my dog and green areas you know something like that
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 2.97 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't know
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 2.97 5.39 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't like famous people
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 5.39 12.82 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't watch (%hesitation%) that kind of news
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 12.82 20.00 <o,Q4,X,P1> and i don't i don't get impressive by any famous people
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 8.20 <o,Q4,X,P1> in my view english is the future language (%hesitation%) that (a-) everybody needs will need to know
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105 8.20 14.21 <o,Q4,X,P1> so to communicate with anyone around the world you need the english
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105 14.21 20.00 <o,Q4,X,P1> so i think is it will be very useful for me and for everyone
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 16.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> to get started i'm gonna put forward the pros and cons about studying at least one foreign language and that it is necessary to pass the university course for the students
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 16.07 32.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the right side it will help the students (themsel-) themselves to broadener their minds and to improve their knowledge of the world
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 32.29 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other side (%hesitation%) wasting time in trying to learn another language could may as well led the students to give up earlier their university course
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 8.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to find out about international news is (f-) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) on the internet
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105 8.60 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to to get informed at the moment that (ha-) the things happened (%hesitation%) wherever in the world
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 5.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i partially agree because there are people who likes to read the newspaper on paper
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105 5.16 11.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it's true that we have to take into account the (e-) the environment
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105 11.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's better to stop printing that newspaper that you can see online
SI1267-00105-P50021 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i truly believe that social media is not reliable (f-) source of news because there are some people who tries to to make (%hesitation%) fake news
SI1267-00105-P50021 1 SI1267-00105 11.94 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i don't understand the reason
SI1267-00105-P50021 1 SI1267-00105 15.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but is
SI1267-00105-P50022 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 11.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think it's of the utmost importance to keep informed about your (l-) your city and your country and so on
SI1267-00105-P50022 1 SI1267-00105 11.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to look up for the news (%hesitation%) in your arounds
SI1267-00105-P50023 1 SI1267-00105 0.00 6.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe it's true that there are too bad news in the media
SI1267-00105-P50023 1 SI1267-00105 6.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but also is true that people like to read bad news so they can compare with their own lives and see that there are not so (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00115-P10005 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 3.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i live in a big city in bangladesh
SI1267-00115-P10005 1 SI1267-00115 3.44 5.31 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it's called chittagong
SI1267-00115-P10005 1 SI1267-00115 5.31 10.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) this city is famous for the for (%hesitation%) the beach

SI1267-00115-P10006 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 9.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> now when i'm in my holiday (%hesitation%) i prefer to do (%hesitation%) hanging out with my friends and watching a lot of movies

SI1267-00115-P10007 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 8.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think i enjoy spending time (%hesitation%) (t-) (%hesitation%) time to everyone in my family
SI1267-00115-P10007 1 SI1267-00115 8.14 13.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but (%hesitation%) most of the time i really enjoy (%hesitation%) spending time with my nephew
SI1267-00115-P10007 1 SI1267-00115 13.77 19.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) she is now two years old and doing (%hesitation%) lots of new thing
SI1267-00115-P10007 1 SI1267-00115 19.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i really
SI1267-00115-P10008 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 8.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well right now i'm studying (%hesitation%) in medical so (%hesitation%) of course i want to be a doctor in future
SI1267-00115-P10008 1 SI1267-00115 8.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so and (%hesitation%) through this profession (%hesitation%) i am to serve the country and (%hesitation%) the people
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 7.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think (%hesitation%) doing job before the graduation is always good (%hesitation%) for a student
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 7.47 12.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it enhance their knowledge and their experiment experience
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 12.91 25.59 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and also they (ca-) they can learn (%hesitation%) teamwork and they are really (%hesitation%) they can enhance their confidence (%hesitation%) that they can do things
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 25.59 32.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but it shouldn't be (%hesitation%) shouldn't be mandatory to pay their (%hesitation%) university studies
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 32.95 35.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it should be (%hesitation%) optional
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 35.48 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if they can manage their time (%hesitation%) they definitely should go for the (%hesitation%) jobs
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 11.75 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) there are seven of the step (%hesitation%) to travelling by airplane (%hesitation%) depending on your availability you can travel to airport for car bus or train
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 11.75 18.07 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) you should reach the airport before (%hesitation%) two or three hours (%hesitation%) before your travel
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 18.07 20.30 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) first step is check in
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 20.30 24.11 <o,Q4,C,P4> you have to (%hesitation%) check in for your bag luggage
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 24.11 27.05 <o,Q4,C,P4> and the second step is document control
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 27.05 31.01 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) they check your all the document your passport your tickets
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 31.01 34.13 <o,Q4,C,P4> and the third is (p-) is step is security
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 34.13 42.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) they (t-) in this step they check your (%hesitation%) bag and your body and (%hesitation%) everything they needed
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 42.00 47.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> and after that you can wait and drink or eat something (%hesitation%) you want
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 47.42 51.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> and there are (%hesitation%) so many shops there you can visit there
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 51.38 58.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> or if you want you can freshen up before (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) board (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to the (%hesitation%) plane
SI1267-00115-P40018 1 SI1267-00115 58.94 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and after

SI1267-00115-P50020 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 7.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i reckon face to face learning is the best way to learn something because (%hesitation%) in this way they can interact more
SI1267-00115-P50020 1 SI1267-00115 7.64 17.08 <o,Q4,C,P5> and a student can ask question and teacher can (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) give answer without any (%hesitation%) interruption of internet or (%hesitation%) anything
SI1267-00115-P50020 1 SI1267-00115 17.08 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so and in the (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00115-P50021 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 13.71 <o,Q4,C,P5> as far as can i tell (%hesitation%) the student group project (%hesitation%) people can learn (%hesitation%) the teamwork because (%hesitation%) when (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) proper people work together they (ha-) have different task
SI1267-00115-P50021 1 SI1267-00115 13.71 18.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> and end the end of the project (%hesitation%) you they have to sum up the whole work
SI1267-00115-P50021 1 SI1267-00115 18.64 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and that
SI1267-00115-P50022 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 15.20 <o,Q4,C,P5> given the choice i think (%hesitation%) attending lecture is more effective than (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) learning alone because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a teacher know that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) which (%hesitation%) which are the main point of a specific topic
SI1267-00115-P50022 1 SI1267-00115 15.20 18.03 <o,Q4,C,P5> and they can focus on that topic
SI1267-00115-P50022 1 SI1267-00115 18.03 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but (%hesitation%) when we learn (alo-)
SI1267-00115-P50023 1 SI1267-00115 0.00 11.05 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i reckon (%hesitation%) providing learning facilities is one of the (%hesitation%) main subjects that a university can provide (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) for their student
SI1267-00115-P50023 1 SI1267-00115 11.05 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and it's really important because the they have to (%hesitation%) compete (tha-) with (%hesitation%) the other university and (%hesitation%) with the
SI1267-00129-P10005 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> actually i am very interested in environment because we need to take care of them because it is (%hesitation%) they it contains all the things that we need to live properly the the oxygens all the properties that we need
SI1267-00129-P10006 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 2.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well this is a good question
SI1267-00129-P10006 1 SI1267-00129 2.50 14.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> normally (%hesitation%) we like to go to the cinema also we like to travel around the world meet (n-) new people new countries so especially things like that
SI1267-00129-P10006 1 SI1267-00129 14.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> also i really like to spend time with them of the
SI1267-00129-P10007 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 3.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well this is a very difficult question
SI1267-00129-P10007 1 SI1267-00129 3.57 4.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> let me see
SI1267-00129-P10007 1 SI1267-00129 4.25 12.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that the we are very close with my mum because we have (%hesitation%) almost the similar similar tastes
SI1267-00129-P10007 1 SI1267-00129 12.14 16.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like the same clothes the same type of reading books
SI1267-00129-P10007 1 SI1267-00129 16.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think that is her
SI1267-00129-P10008 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 14.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'd really like to know different cultures so i think that i'd really like to live in in my future i don't know maybe in united states or united kingdom because i think that their culture is very interesting
SI1267-00129-P10008 1 SI1267-00129 14.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but also holland is is really like
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 2.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well this is a good topic
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 2.76 8.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that it's very necessary that students take time to do fitness classes
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 8.84 9.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> why
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 9.83 10.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> ok look
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 10.88 17.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the fitness classes are the opportunity to them to disconnect our studies our studies
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 17.95 27.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also is a opportunity to free all the energy that they have and focus in the year in their studies
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 27.70 38.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also i think that one of the disadvantages are that they (ha-) if they have a lot of time to do fitness classes they lost the opportunity to focus in other things
SI1267-00129-P30017 1 SI1267-00129 38.99 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion is that we need to put (%hesitation%) the same classes of fitness that all the things that are are important too
SI1267-00129-P40018 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 6.26 <o,Q4,C,P4> okay (%hesitation%) today we are talking about how honey is produced
SI1267-00129-P40018 1 SI1267-00129 6.26 10.50 <o,Q4,C,P4> first of all bees collect the nectar from the flowers
SI1267-00129-P40018 1 SI1267-00129 10.50 15.24 <o,Q4,C,P4> with this nectar (%hesitation%) the bees make honey in the beehives
SI1267-00129-P40018 1 SI1267-00129 15.24 28.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the honey are ready beekeepers collect honey from this from this beehives and put in a special crystal jars because is the best way to maintain properly the the honey
SI1267-00129-P40018 1 SI1267-00129 28.59 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> this the beekeepers (%hesitation%) show the the honey to the supermarket when is the place we are buy them
SI1267-00129-P50019 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 6.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i'd really think that is very difficult to choose (%hesitation%) the better country no
SI1267-00129-P50019 1 SI1267-00129 6.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00129-P50020 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my humble opinion i think that study in a second language is the opportunity to improve this this (know-) our knowledge of this language and take the opportunity to talk better in this language
SI1267-00129-P50021 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> first of all i think that the first difficulty they have (%hesitation%) take is to communicate with other people because you know the language but they also have their only their own way to speak
SI1267-00129-P50022 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in my opinion i think that the best way to know about local culture is to meet people in (%hesitation%) that are original orginal in the country and also try to do a lot of excursions to meet all the country
SI1267-00129-P50023 1 SI1267-00129 0.00 6.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well from point of view i think that all these person have some of reason no
SI1267-00129-P50023 1 SI1267-00129 6.40 17.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> when you live abroad in another country you need the necessity to to grow up like a person because your dads are not here so you need to grow up
SI1267-00129-P50023 1 SI1267-00129 17.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think that is correct
SI1267-00146-P10005 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm really interested in to help to care the environment at least to do my bests because every persons can make the difference if they care their own space to live
SI1267-00146-P10006 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well in this time of pandemic i don't have a lot of contact with my friends but i we enjoy to have conversations
SI1267-00146-P10007 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that slightly my mother is a little bit similar to me and slightly as well my son
SI1267-00146-P10008 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to live abroad in the future or in a place near the beach

SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 2.25 6.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about the production and commercialization of honey
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 6.29 10.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all bees gather the nectar from flowers
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 10.16 20.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) bees produce honey with the nectar and pollen in beehives
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 20.33 26.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the responsible to collect the honey are the beekeepers from the beehives
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 26.46 36.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the (%hesitation%) the honey is filled is filled in specific containers
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 36.31 51.39 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) afterwards the (%hesitation%) these containers are are carried by vans to the particular shops
SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 51.39 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then we have as delicious honey to buy
SI1267-00146-P50019 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> they should consider if they are able to speak and learn the language of the of the country and of course (%hesitation%) to have a place in which they can live for instance (%hesitation%) a host family
SI1267-00146-P50020 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the main benefit to study (%hesitation%) a foreign language is to learn something new (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) about a different culture and to communicate with different people as well
SI1267-00146-P50021 1 SI1267-00146 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> they might have troubles when they want to communicate with the local people because (%hesitation%) you are a student and maybe (%hesitation%) your language is is not clear for the local people

SI1267-00167-P30017 1 SI1267-00167 18.83 25.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) is a advantage for it

SI1267-00197-P40018 1 SI1267-00197 13.12 36.14 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first we have tunes (%hesitation%) net tune net that the first day (%hesitation%) was very low (%hesitation%) has a very few thousand of people (%hesitation%) but in the last days (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) they reach (%hesitation%) they (ma-) manage to (he-) to be the the most visited place
SI1267-00197-P40018 1 SI1267-00197 36.14 43.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) music now (%hesitation%) i think that it (wor-) (%hesitation%) works (ve-) very good
SI1267-00197-P40018 1 SI1267-00197 43.67 46.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they (kee-) they keeps their numbers more or less

SI1267-00197-P40018 1 SI1267-00197 54.27 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but now (%hesitation%) the last day it was (%hesitation%) very decrease a lot
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 0.00 6.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> ok well i'm talking about the process to the honey
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 6.87 14.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so in the first step we need (%hesitation%) bees (%hesitation%) one bee to collect nectar from the flowers
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 14.34 21.94 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and later this bee going to their beehives and put this nectar in the box
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 21.94 27.98 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and in the third step the beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 27.98 31.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i think that it is (v-) a very dangerous work
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 31.75 42.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so later this honey put on in a bottle in a glass bottle and transport to the different supermarkets
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 42.78 48.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and these honey is ready for the customers
SI1267-00238-P40018 1 SI1267-00238 48.29 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i need to think that is i love the honey
SI1267-00268-P10005 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interested in the environment because i think that environment give many effects to human and if we don't (%hesitation%) don't know about the environment we can't do
SI1267-00268-P10006 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 16.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> me and my friends enjoy going to climb mountains see beautiful sceneries and sometimes we go to some of the friends' house to play some video games
SI1267-00268-P10006 1 SI1267-00268 16.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and if the weather is good
SI1267-00268-P10007 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 8.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my family i am most similar to my mother i mean the appearance is most similar to my mother
SI1267-00268-P10007 1 SI1267-00268 8.93 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but in the characteristic i'm more similar to my father because my mother is a talkative person but i'm not a
SI1267-00268-P10008 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 9.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in the future i think that i would choose to live by the seaside because i love the sea breeze
SI1267-00268-P10008 1 SI1267-00268 9.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and seafood is one of the food that i like it and if i live by the seaside i could eat seafood every day
SI1267-00268-P30017 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 15.93 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the advantage of school and colleges make time in school day for doing fitnesses classes is they can ensure the health of their students
SI1267-00268-P30017 1 SI1267-00268 15.93 37.73 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage of making fitnesses classes in school day is maybe the students is (un-) are unwilling to join the class but the school or the colleges force them to join the class
SI1267-00268-P30017 1 SI1267-00268 37.73 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think that schools and colleges should make time in the school days for all students to do fitnesses classes because this can ensure that their student be healthier
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 5.15 <o,Q4,B1,P4> now i am going to explain how honey is produced
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 5.15 10.03 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first the bees need to collect nectar from flowers
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 10.03 17.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after they collect the nectar they will make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 17.70 26.22 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and seal the honey into the jar
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 26.22 39.88 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after they seal the (j-) the jar of honey will be moved into a van and sent to supermarket that we can buy the honey
SI1267-00268-P40018 1 SI1267-00268 39.88 43.85 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this is how honey produced

SI1267-00268-P50019 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the things that should student will consider when they choosing a country to study is they will think that the staff and how the facility will the country give and what
SI1267-00268-P50020 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 13.51 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) the advantage of studying in a second language is we could gain more knowledge than other people who don't studies a second language
SI1267-00268-P50020 1 SI1267-00268 13.51 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and we can communicate with other people that use the (langua-)
SI1267-00268-P50021 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the difficulty of studying in another country is they need to learn a new language and the cost of studying in another country will be expensive than studying in our own country
SI1267-00268-P50022 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 14.05 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when they are studying in another country they can (f-) (%hesitation%) they can go for their festival eating their food and makes (%hesitation%) the country friends

SI1267-00268-P50023 1 SI1267-00268 0.00 13.53 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that studying in another country will help student become independents because they don't have people to help them in another country
SI1267-00268-P50023 1 SI1267-00268 13.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the odd things that each need to do by themself but not
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 0.00 6.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> production process from flower to shops begins as follows
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 6.87 18.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first bees collect nectar from flowers that they find out in lands (%hesitation%) of different types and kind flowers
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 18.87 22.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these bees make honey from nectar in his beehives
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 22.79 25.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's a really amazing process
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 25.03 31.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when it's over beekeepers collect the honey from beehives wearing (%hesitation%) protective clothes
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 31.95 34.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is very important
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 34.27 40.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the honey is put into jars or bottles
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 40.27 51.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and later these bottles (%hesitation%) are be transported to shops where we can phone it
SI1267-00308-P40018 1 SI1267-00308 51.54 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) there are a lot of (st-) (%hesitation%) choose between the different type of

SI1267-00314-P10005 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i am not i am not interested at all but i always try to respect the environment (%hesitation%) the more i can (%hesitation%) recycling and doing these type of things
SI1267-00314-P10006 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well (%hesitation%) with my friends we enjoy doing a lot of things but in general we play video games (%hesitation%) we smoke marijuana and (%hesitation%) watch (%hesitation%) tv series
SI1267-00314-P10007 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very similar to my father because (%hesitation%) we both are (%hesitation%) very funny very like (%hesitation%) talkative and we always (l-) (%hesitation%) want to to have fun

SI1267-00314-P30017 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 2.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are some advantages
SI1267-00314-P30017 1 SI1267-00314 2.72 8.81 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example the students will have better marks and they will have more options in the future
SI1267-00314-P30017 1 SI1267-00314 8.81 12.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but it also have its disadvantages
SI1267-00314-P30017 1 SI1267-00314 12.67 19.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example the students will get more tired and they will have less free time
SI1267-00314-P30017 1 SI1267-00314 19.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think it is a bad idea because some students have some lessons out school and if they spend more time at school they will not be able to go to their other lessons
SI1267-00314-P40018 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 5.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> at first bees collect nectar from flowers
SI1267-00314-P40018 1 SI1267-00314 5.00 12.46 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then they save (nec-) the nectar in beehives where they make honey with it
SI1267-00314-P40018 1 SI1267-00314 12.46 20.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after this the beekeepers collect the honey and they send it to a factory
SI1267-00314-P40018 1 SI1267-00314 20.34 24.99 <o,Q4,B1,P4> in the factory the honey is (pro-) processate
SI1267-00314-P40018 1 SI1267-00314 24.99 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally some cars take the honey and they send it to the shops where the honey will be sold to the public
SI1267-00314-P50019 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 15.28 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the students (%hesitation%) usually consider the place the different place they can visit the beaches they can (%hesitation%) go

SI1267-00314-P50021 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the more difficult thing is to get (%hesitation%) have relationships (%hesitation%) in where you can (%hesitation%) get (%hesitation%) comfortable in another country and studying with other people
SI1267-00314-P50022 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think (%hesitation%) it can be very important to have different friends of different culture and you can go and visit the different places of the country with them
SI1267-00314-P50023 1 SI1267-00314 0.00 14.31 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well i think that if you go to another country you are not with your parents and you can (%hesitation%) you have to ltve alone for (%hesitation%) a long time
SI1267-00314-P50023 1 SI1267-00314 14.31 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and i think you will become independent (%hesitation%) from

SI1267-00320-P10005 1 SI1267-00320 8.00 9.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> i live in the centre of it
SI1267-00320-P10005 1 SI1267-00320 9.96 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i really like it because it's close to many sites (%hesitation%) universities cinemas libraries pretty much every
SI1267-00320-P10006 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 9.12 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think what i enjoy the most doing when i'm on holidays is going to the beach with my family
SI1267-00320-P10006 1 SI1267-00320 9.12 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> however when not all family can gather because our holidays (%hesitation%) do not overlap i also like (goi-)
SI1267-00320-P10007 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,C,P1> the person i enjoy spending time with the most would be my mother
SI1267-00320-P10007 1 SI1267-00320 7.41 11.86 <o,Q4,C,P1> i live with her and we have so many things in common

SI1267-00320-P10008 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 4.95 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would like to work as a programmer
SI1267-00320-P10008 1 SI1267-00320 4.95 8.09 <o,Q4,C,P1> i really enjoy programming
SI1267-00320-P10008 1 SI1267-00320 8.09 10.53 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think it's really fun and challenging
SI1267-00320-P10008 1 SI1267-00320 10.53 15.75 <o,Q4,C,P1> and you have to approach different problems in a creative way
SI1267-00320-P10008 1 SI1267-00320 15.75 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i think it's an
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 14.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think working while you are studying in university is something that has both advantages and downsides
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 14.02 21.78 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main advantage obviously is the fact that you don't need to have your parents pay for your university
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 21.78 32.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> universities are usually (%hesitation%) hugely expensive so of course it's not something great for parents to have to pay for it
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 32.55 42.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however the main disadvantage is that the amount of time that you have for both yourself and the studying is greatly reduced
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 42.47 48.11 <o,Q4,B2,P3> which means that probably your grades and social life will be affected
SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 48.11 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i do think it's good to have a job to pay for studies because it helps you (%hesitation%) program your
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 4.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> travelling by airplane is quite simple
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 4.47 9.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> however there are a few things that you do need to know
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 9.29 12.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all you should get to the airport
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 12.38 20.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's usually far from cities so you should go either by car or public transport
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 20.55 37.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i recommend you (%hesitation%) get to the airport a few hours before your flight because that way you will have enough time to do the check in the document control and go through security
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 37.06 44.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> otherwise you might have problems and you might even lose your flight
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 44.34 46.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to wait
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 46.38 52.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> however you can make the most of the waiting time by going to restaurants
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 52.49 56.32 <o,Q4,B2,P4> finally when you are called you have to board
SI1267-00320-P40018 1 SI1267-00320 56.32 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and just get ready
SI1267-00320-P50019 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 7.09 <o,Q4,C,P5> i tend to believe that technology is an extremely powerful tool for students
SI1267-00320-P50019 1 SI1267-00320 7.09 12.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> for it has never been so simple to just have a question
SI1267-00320-P50019 1 SI1267-00320 12.43 18.88 <o,Q4,C,P5> now it's really easy to just look it up on the internet and find as many answers as you like
SI1267-00320-P50019 1 SI1267-00320 18.88 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and you can
SI1267-00320-P50020 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 11.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i'm of the opinion that face to face learning is always better than just learning by yourself
SI1267-00320-P50020 1 SI1267-00320 11.04 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) the main benefit from it is that the teacher can adapt to your way of learning and present to you the information in
SI1267-00320-P50021 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 10.87 <o,Q4,C,P5> i feel as if group projects help students improve both their conflict resolution skills and their teamwork
SI1267-00320-P50021 1 SI1267-00320 10.87 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> both of these skills are remarkably important way of working in companies or pretty much
SI1267-00320-P50022 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i tend to believe that attending lectures (%hesitation%) is in most cases a waste of time because students are forced to attend lectures which they just don't have any interest in and so they just don't listen
SI1267-00320-P50023 1 SI1267-00320 0.00 11.72 <o,Q4,C,P5> i would say it's (%hesitation%) downright necessary because learning facilities are places for students to unite
SI1267-00320-P50023 1 SI1267-00320 11.72 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and learning is much more efficient when it's done in groups with friends than can help you with

SI1267-00363-P10005 1 SI1267-00363 14.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i think that is a paradise because they
SI1267-00363-P10006 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i used to enjoy (%hesitation%) go to the beach with my friends and with my family but now (%hesitation%) i like to travel with my boyfriend and with my friends too and other countries

SI1267-00363-P10008 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 9.49 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would really like to be a teacher because (%hesitation%) it is (%hesitation%) what i studied

SI1267-00363-P30017 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 13.32 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) the student never (%hesitation%) should pay (%hesitation%) their university studies with jobs
SI1267-00363-P30017 1 SI1267-00363 13.32 14.07 <o,Q4,B1,P3> never
SI1267-00363-P30017 1 SI1267-00363 14.07 37.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that all people (%hesitation%) have rights of start study (%hesitation%) with with impression (%hesitation%) all people have right (%hesitation%) education
SI1267-00363-P30017 1 SI1267-00363 37.00 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i think that (%hesitation%) never (%hesitation%) never student should pay nothing about this (%hesitation%) maybe (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a bit a bit price but not all studies not all

SI1267-00363-P40018 1 SI1267-00363 7.65 9.69 <o,Q4,B1,P4> is very important
SI1267-00363-P40018 1 SI1267-00363 9.69 22.66 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) after (%hesitation%) you have check in in the airport and give them (%hesitation%) document control
SI1267-00363-P40018 1 SI1267-00363 22.66 31.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) also the security (%hesitation%) is very important
SI1267-00363-P40018 1 SI1267-00363 31.39 45.88 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you you have passed the security and so you must wait until (%hesitation%) arrive arrive the the arrive the board
SI1267-00363-P40018 1 SI1267-00363 45.88 49.43 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) after board (%hesitation%) fly

SI1267-00363-P50019 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 6.93 <o,Q4,B1,P5> maybe yes because we live in the era of technology
SI1267-00363-P50019 1 SI1267-00363 6.93 19.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but also i think that (%hesitation%) a lot of people don't have the technology don't have a p c
SI1267-00363-P50019 1 SI1267-00363 19.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so
SI1267-00363-P50020 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 2.14 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think yes
SI1267-00363-P50020 1 SI1267-00363 2.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think yes because you can ask to a teacher better that when when you have in your house and in face to face you you have attention at the class
SI1267-00363-P50021 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to do together group projects (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) give them (%hesitation%) the possibility (%hesitation%) that learn about (%hesitation%) other opinions other people other culture
SI1267-00363-P50022 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 14.51 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion yes because (%hesitation%) there there is there is (%hesitation%) there are people that no don't like (%hesitation%) lecture
SI1267-00363-P50022 1 SI1267-00363 14.51 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so (%hesitation%) can be positive for lecture
SI1267-00363-P50023 1 SI1267-00363 0.00 16.35 <o,Q4,B1,P5> from my point of view it's very very important that (%hesitation%) the university (%hesitation%) give them (%hesitation%) facilities for for learning better
SI1267-00363-P50023 1 SI1267-00363 16.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it's a right of a student

SI1267-00365-P10007 1 SI1267-00365 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in my opinion (%hesitation%) to improve your english (%hesitation%) you should (%hesitation%) studying with a native (%hesitation%) teacher who learned you (%hesitation%) how to study this language
SI1267-00365-P10008 1 SI1267-00365 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i (%hesitation%) could (%hesitation%) learn a new skill it (%hesitation%) would be (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) speaking english very well because of the fact that i need to learn it to my (%hesitation%) improve my job

SI1267-00365-P30017 1 SI1267-00365 52.69 55.03 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's a good idea

SI1267-00416-P50020 1 SI1267-00416 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i totally agree with those people because every day or i'm see more that people is using the (%hesitation%) the news (p-) on the internet to check to see this newpr newspaper via
SI1267-00416-P50021 1 SI1267-00416 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i don't think social media it's a reliable media because people sometimes tends to be really mean and they can publish (%hesitation%) false information so
SI1267-00416-P50022 1 SI1267-00416 0.00 16.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it's really important to keep the local news (%hesitation%) mostly for the (eld-) elderly (pe-) elderly people because they don't know how to use the internet to check the the newspapers
SI1267-00416-P50022 1 SI1267-00416 16.94 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so for them it will be available
SI1267-00416-P50023 1 SI1267-00416 0.00 15.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00416-P50023 1 SI1267-00416 15.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's why they are every time publishing more bad
SI1267-00420-P10005 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 8.89 <o,Q5,C,P1> yes i live in a very small town called poza rica in the state of veracruz mexico next to the gulf of mexico
SI1267-00420-P10005 1 SI1267-00420 8.89 15.26 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it's very quiet (%hesitation%) like one hour from mexico city by by car
SI1267-00420-P10005 1 SI1267-00420 15.26 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> we have many different and (%hesitation%) beautiful beaches near

SI1267-00420-P10007 1 SI1267-00420 2.20 3.10 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love my mom
SI1267-00420-P10007 1 SI1267-00420 3.10 4.22 <o,Q5,C,P1> she is the best
SI1267-00420-P10007 1 SI1267-00420 4.22 8.24 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can talk with her about everything and anything special
SI1267-00420-P10007 1 SI1267-00420 8.24 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example yesterday i invited her to to go to the city centre to a restaurant and had the chance to talk to her about the my last girlfriend
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 2.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 2.70 5.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i would like to have an outer space job
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 5.29 8.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> everything related to space is what i love
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 8.46 11.36 <o,Q5,C,P1> i really like what nasa (%hesitation%) do
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 11.36 17.97 <o,Q5,C,P1> so (%hesitation%) a job in nasa (%hesitation%) it's it's definitely what that's that would be a dream that's a dream for me
SI1267-00420-P10008 1 SI1267-00420 17.97 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i really would
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 8.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well definitely i think there are many advantage that all students should have jobs to pay their universities
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 8.35 16.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example one of the advantage i think is (%hesitation%) for mental health (%hesitation%) and also for not having a debt with the bank
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 16.70 29.97 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example in my case when i was studying in the u k i had the opportunity to have (%hesitation%) a job when i finished my studies and with the money i i earned this job i pay the the the half with the bank
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 29.97 36.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and definitely this helped me to have (%hesitation%) not any problem with (%hesitation%) mental health
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 36.22 38.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i don't see any disadvantage honestly
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 38.95 45.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think this this should be something (%hesitation%) that everyone must do after university
SI1267-00420-P30017 1 SI1267-00420 45.16 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion everyone (%hesitation%) should have (%hesitation%) should get a job after universities in order to pay the university expenses or university (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 2.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello everyone
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 2.02 5.57 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i going to give my presentation about travelling by airplane
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 5.57 12.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the process start by travelling to the airport and then to board into the to the airplane
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 12.15 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so basically first off we need to get (%hesitation%) transportation to get to the airport
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 17.35 22.07 <o,Q4,B2,P4> we (c-) we can use our own car bus transportation or whatever we want
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 22.07 25.85 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you get to the airport we need to do the check in
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 25.85 36.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the check in we will show our (d-) documents to the control (%hesitation%) person and then when we checked our baggage we move to the the document control
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 36.41 43.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) some security people will check our document will check all personal items and then we will go to the waiting room
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 43.72 54.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the waiting room we can have we can eat we can go to the (ba-) (%hesitation%) restroom we can buy souvenirs a coffee in order to wait until (%hesitation%) finally we get to (%hesitation%) our plane
SI1267-00420-P40018 1 SI1267-00420 54.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you get to your plane
SI1267-00420-P50019 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 1.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> very interesting question
SI1267-00420-P50019 1 SI1267-00420 1.88 4.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well we can use the technology in many ways
SI1267-00420-P50019 1 SI1267-00420 4.26 9.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example we can use it (%hesitation%) i use this for teaching my students (%hesitation%) university students
SI1267-00420-P50019 1 SI1267-00420 9.98 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so my students use the online platforms to have the classes so they they don't get affected by the virus
SI1267-00420-P50019 1 SI1267-00420 17.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00420-P50020 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 5.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well definitely both options have the advantage and disadvantage
SI1267-00420-P50020 1 SI1267-00420 5.06 6.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> face to face is great
SI1267-00420-P50020 1 SI1267-00420 6.44 14.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so you you have any question you can ask (%hesitation%) straightforward to your teacher or you can ask to your (%hesitation%) partners next to you
SI1267-00420-P50020 1 SI1267-00420 14.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however (%hesitation%) online classes are also great
SI1267-00420-P50021 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 2.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> definitely teamwork
SI1267-00420-P50021 1 SI1267-00420 2.18 9.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) teamworking is an essential essential skill we need to learn in this in in the modern world we are living
SI1267-00420-P50021 1 SI1267-00420 9.27 14.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we we tend to we tend to share our information
SI1267-00420-P50021 1 SI1267-00420 14.16 15.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we tend to work with many people
SI1267-00420-P50021 1 SI1267-00420 15.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00420-P50022 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 5.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think reading alone is definitely a good option
SI1267-00420-P50022 1 SI1267-00420 5.05 8.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example in my case i prefer learning by (%hesitation%) by myself
SI1267-00420-P50022 1 SI1267-00420 8.93 16.15 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'd like to buy books and with those book i like to study a specific subject and specialise in that subject
SI1267-00420-P50022 1 SI1267-00420 16.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however i think attending lectures you
SI1267-00420-P50023 1 SI1267-00420 0.00 7.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is extremely important for example now with the virus we are using online platforms to teach our classes
SI1267-00420-P50023 1 SI1267-00420 7.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so definitely all universities should have at least internet with good velocity and also good computers so that the students can have their lectures
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 0.00 6.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> here in the picture we can see how pollution causes acid rain
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 6.82 12.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) produce pollution
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 12.22 20.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this acid (part-) particles (%hesitation%) which are in smoke (%hesitation%) they go up
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 20.02 24.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so these acid particles are carried by wind
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 24.20 31.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and wind (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) causes that other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 31.23 38.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so some acid particles fall as dust and some other (%hesitation%) mix with cloud water
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 38.14 44.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so when it rains these acid particles are (%hesitation%) in the rain or in the snow
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 44.75 48.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they came up to the to the earth
SI1267-00432-P40018 1 SI1267-00432 48.21 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they damage the environment at the end
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 0.00 8.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in order to travel by airplane the first thing at first you need to get to the airport
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 8.97 14.76 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can do that (%hesitation%) riding by car or bus or train
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 14.76 22.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you are there you have to check in (%hesitation%) you have to do the check in and revise your visa
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 22.86 27.21 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) one police maybe could do that
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 27.21 41.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that (%hesitation%) they have to (re-) revise your packing and if they find something that is impossible to be there they (%hesitation%) retain this product
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 41.80 49.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (unti-) (%hesitation%) before (%hesitation%) is necessary to wait until the the plane (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) take off
SI1267-00450-P40018 1 SI1267-00450 49.82 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> where is the time you go to you get to the plane and (%hesitation%) the plane take off and arrive to the to the destination
SI1267-00482-P10005 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 2.79 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to listen to music
SI1267-00482-P10005 1 SI1267-00482 2.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like the kind of the music of the r r and b
SI1267-00482-P10006 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 2.31 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's so much fun to me
SI1267-00482-P10006 1 SI1267-00482 2.31 14.25 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) local food in the foreign country is a very important factor of the travel
SI1267-00482-P10006 1 SI1267-00482 14.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy them
SI1267-00482-P10007 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 8.86 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like to meet to bill gates who is founder of the microsoft corporation
SI1267-00482-P10007 1 SI1267-00482 8.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> he changed our world dramatically in the world most in the world
SI1267-00482-P10008 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 15.23 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00482-P10008 1 SI1267-00482 15.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i have to try hard to
SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 11.42 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantage is student can know the (%hesitation%) new language which is spoken by in the world
SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 11.42 23.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) it is not enough volume for studying to foreign language in a year
SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 23.75 35.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion is student have to study one or more foreign language in their university course
SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 35.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's because the student will be (%hesitation%) get (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (ab-) ability of the foreign language
SI1267-00482-P50019 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the best way to find international news is (%hesitation%) (ac-) accessing world wide web and (%hesitation%) find the international website on the internet like b b c or c n n
SI1267-00482-P50020 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 4.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i'm agree with that opinion
SI1267-00482-P50020 1 SI1267-00482 4.19 15.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in the future the paper newspaper it tends to (%hesitation%) the digital device like tablet or smartphone
SI1267-00482-P50020 1 SI1267-00482 15.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> people can find (in-)
SI1267-00482-P50021 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 3.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no it's not reliable for me
SI1267-00482-P50021 1 SI1267-00482 3.34 8.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) social media focusing on the spread the information
SI1267-00482-P50021 1 SI1267-00482 8.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so the not always (%hesitation%) a great information to be spreaded
SI1267-00482-P50022 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 4.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also we are living in the international social
SI1267-00482-P50022 1 SI1267-00482 4.17 14.99 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) big things they'll happen in the our near in a our own living
SI1267-00482-P50022 1 SI1267-00482 14.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00482-P50023 1 SI1267-00482 0.00 2.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think so too
SI1267-00482-P50023 1 SI1267-00482 2.16 8.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but there is some good news when you find carefully
SI1267-00482-P50023 1 SI1267-00482 8.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) we have to focus on the good news such a good news
SI1267-00487-P10005 1 SI1267-00487 0.00 16.83 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i am currently (%hesitation%) very interested in (%hesitation%) learning about other countries because i think that it gives you other (%hesitation%) culture and you can knew (%hesitation%) new people
SI1267-00487-P10005 1 SI1267-00487 16.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so yeah it's very very important for me
SI1267-00487-P10006 1 SI1267-00487 0.00 14.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well actually i just not have (%hesitation%) a lot of time because (%hesitation%) as i said i'm studying a physics degree so i'm currently busy every time with my studies
SI1267-00487-P10006 1 SI1267-00487 14.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but all the weekends i usually go with my friends or my girlfriend yeah
SI1267-00487-P10007 1 SI1267-00487 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i think that the best way to improve my english (%hesitation%) will be travelling (%hesitation%) to another country maybe at the u k or the u s a because i think that is very important to speak with native people you know

SI1267-00487-P30017 1 SI1267-00487 0.00 19.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think that all of the university students should do part time jobs when they are studying because there are a lot of advantages like (%hesitation%) you are able to earn more money so you are more independent
SI1267-00487-P30017 1 SI1267-00487 19.72 29.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and overall i think that it's so important because you are not (%hesitation%) dependent of your parents
SI1267-00487-P30017 1 SI1267-00487 29.12 34.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so yeah i think that this is is the the main advantage
SI1267-00487-P30017 1 SI1267-00487 34.88 50.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and some disadvantages i can say (%hesitation%) for instance you are not able to study so much because you will be you will have less time to study
SI1267-00487-P30017 1 SI1267-00487 50.30 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so yeah i think i think that this is the main disadvantage
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 0.00 5.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so yeah we can see here a diagram about acid rain
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 5.82 18.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i'm going to start with the the factories and vehicles that contaminate the air with (%hesitation%) a lot of pollution in form of acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 18.21 29.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then these acids particles are carried by wind which (%hesitation%) carry them to other zones other areas
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 29.76 34.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) this acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 34.30 42.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and later (%hesitation%) it could be rain or snow to (%hesitation%) our forest or lakes
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 42.34 49.64 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) of course they damage to our environment they damage our environment
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 49.64 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so it's so bad yeah

SI1267-00488-P10007 1 SI1267-00488 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the best way to improve my english is to (s-) (%hesitation%) talk more and study more
SI1267-00488-P10008 1 SI1267-00488 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it will be skiing
SI1267-00488-P40018 1 SI1267-00488 0.00 8.86 <o,Q5,B1,P4> as all we know factories and the vehicles emit the (pollu-) (%hesitation%) pollution smokes
SI1267-00488-P40018 1 SI1267-00488 8.86 12.66 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the pollution smokes have acid particles in the smoke

SI1267-00520-P40018 1 SI1267-00520 14.17 23.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so the consequences can be on one hand those particles change (%hesitation%) into a dust and fall over the land

SI1267-00547-P40018 1 SI1267-00547 15.54 25.44 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first beekeepers collect honey from bee hives and put in different recipients
SI1267-00547-P40018 1 SI1267-00547 25.44 33.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the bees collect nectar from flowers and the bees make honey from nectar in the hives
SI1267-00547-P40018 1 SI1267-00547 33.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the beekeepers collect again the honey from bee hives and sell them
SI1267-00551-P10005 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 7.11 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am very interest and i like to (%hesitation%) recycle and that kind of stuff
SI1267-00551-P10005 1 SI1267-00551 7.11 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it is important now more now more than than ever because the the world's changing a lot and we have to do something about it
SI1267-00551-P10006 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 16.48 <o,Q4,C,P1> we'd like to go to places to eat and also (%hesitation%) do hiking and walk to the mountain and watch some landscape and also go to the beach

SI1267-00551-P10007 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 13.98 <o,Q5,C,P1> i believe that we are all different (%hesitation%) and we have like some things about (%hesitation%) each each one
SI1267-00551-P10007 1 SI1267-00551 13.98 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P1> so it would be like a mix of everyone

SI1267-00551-P10008 1 SI1267-00551 1.48 19.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> but some place in europe could be very cool thing because i see that they have a lot of (%hesitation%) improvement and the people are like more open thinking and that
SI1267-00551-P10008 1 SI1267-00551 19.03 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so we may
SI1267-00551-P30017 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 10.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well the advantages are that it could (%hesitation%) help with mental health and physical (%hesitation%) health too
SI1267-00551-P30017 1 SI1267-00551 10.20 20.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and also is important because they show that the exercise improve the way the people learn
SI1267-00551-P30017 1 SI1267-00551 20.62 22.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so this a good thing

SI1267-00551-P30017 1 SI1267-00551 40.00 53.12 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my (o-) in my opinion that should do the time for fitness classes because they have more positive impact in a person's life that (%hesitation%) disadvantages
SI1267-00551-P30017 1 SI1267-00551 53.12 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so they could (%hesitation%) they should do it
SI1267-00551-P40018 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 9.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first step for producing honey is that the bees have to collect the nectar from the flowers
SI1267-00551-P40018 1 SI1267-00551 9.56 18.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then they go to the beehive in where they (%hesitation%) transform the nectar into honey
SI1267-00551-P40018 1 SI1267-00551 18.96 27.45 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) after that the beekeepers take that (%hesitation%) honey and put into jars
SI1267-00551-P40018 1 SI1267-00551 27.45 33.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they collect the honey from the beehive put that honey into a jar
SI1267-00551-P40018 1 SI1267-00551 33.86 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then these jars are transporting (%hesitation%) into (%hesitation%) are transported to the supermarket where we buy it
SI1267-00551-P50019 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 6.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think one one of the more important thing things is the language

SI1267-00551-P50020 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> one of the advantage that you have is that you have more opportunities to work in all different countries because you can well aim back to your (%hesitation%) to your own country or (%hesitation%) go to another country when do you speak
SI1267-00551-P50021 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 8.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think that the barrier of the language can be (%hesitation%) under important issue

SI1267-00551-P50022 1 SI1267-00551 0.00 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the involvement with the people that live in there in that country is an great opportunity for (%hesitation%) to learn their culture to go to places that they usually go and to markets and that stuff

SI1267-00597-P10008 1 SI1267-00597 13.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and in this world of (glo-) globalisation we have to do it
SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 0.00 10.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> okay i'm going to start to explain why you should study at least one foreign language in order to pass your university course
SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 10.14 15.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for me the advantages are that you are going to be more international
SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 15.43 23.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you you will be able to talk with (%hesitation%) other people around the world and communicate with (h-) with them
SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 23.83 33.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and for me the disadvantages is are that (%hesitation%) you are going to waste time for your studies could be
SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 33.02 36.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you have to be very focus on on this

SI1267-00597-P30017 1 SI1267-00597 50.44 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but in my opinion it's necessary nowadays because of the globalization and the languages
SI1267-00597-P50019 1 SI1267-00597 0.00 14.65 <o,Q4,B2,P5> nowadays there are a lot of ways to know about international news like twitter social media internet the real newspapers
SI1267-00597-P50019 1 SI1267-00597 14.65 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and for me the most important thing is internet because you can find
SI1267-00597-P50020 1 SI1267-00597 0.00 10.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with them because i think that newspaper is an obsolete (%hesitation%) way of seeing news
SI1267-00597-P50020 1 SI1267-00597 10.64 17.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think that cover the social media cover all all these types of news
SI1267-00597-P50020 1 SI1267-00597 17.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you don't have to buy a
SI1267-00597-P50021 1 SI1267-00597 0.00 4.24 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it's the best way to see news in general
SI1267-00597-P50021 1 SI1267-00597 4.24 7.28 <o,Q4,B2,P5> international news or your local news
SI1267-00597-P50021 1 SI1267-00597 7.28 18.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think it's more accessible to all because (%hesitation%) nowadays all people have a an (smart-) an smartphone or a p c or a tablet
SI1267-00597-P50021 1 SI1267-00597 18.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's it
SI1267-00597-P50022 1 SI1267-00597 0.00 13.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it's the best important because if you don't want to know about (%hesitation%) your the place you are living it's like (%hesitation%) you you are you are don't really interested in nothing
SI1267-00597-P50022 1 SI1267-00597 13.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to be inform (%hesitation%) with your local news because if you are going to

SI1267-00597-P50023 1 SI1267-00597 15.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but for me if i have a newspaper i will

SI1267-00616-P30017 1 SI1267-00616 21.96 31.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it is believed that study foreign languages can develop brain process positively

SI1267-00616-P30017 1 SI1267-00616 35.34 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the reason what it could be negative is to effect exam marks and as a result every person has they own vision and being conscious of the fact that we belong to the same group having the freedom to express yourself in the way that feel it right

SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616 0.00 3.61 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i have my mind up about it
SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616 3.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> then i have an unshakeable belief that social media as a source of knowledge could be taken into positive and highly consideration
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616 0.00 5.71 <o,Q5,B1,P5> firstly we need to balance the pros and cons
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616 5.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i got the answer right funnily enough there is not enough bad news at social media
SI1267-00619-P10005 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm fascinated in learning other countries because i think it can not only expand my horizons but it will also caught with my interest
SI1267-00619-P10006 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy spending my free time playing video games and reading books and listening to musics because i think playing video games can relax me from the daily stress and listening to musics and reading books serves as well to save me under the pressure
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 13.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve my english is speaking like speaking with foreigners speaking with my classmates speaking with my teachers because speaking can really improve my english
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 13.79 16.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it can help me in writing and reading
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 16.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so speaking is important
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 9.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to learn how to drive a car because when i was a kid i'm dreamed of having my own car and drive it to wherever i like
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619 9.95 15.13 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if i can learn how drive a car i can do whatever we want
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619 15.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's convenient to drive a car
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 3.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> well the advantages are clear
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 3.55 9.34 <o,Q5,C,P3> firstly they can earn some money to support their family and pay for their tuitions
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 9.34 14.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> and secondly (%hesitation%) they can increase their experience of the society
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 14.28 16.84 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think there are also drawbacks
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 16.84 28.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> well firstly (%hesitation%) it is a great waste of time and energy and that will (al-) also cause them do bad in the academics part
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 28.39 35.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> and but my own opinion is that i think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 35.21 47.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> because i think with adequate part time jobs you can adapted to the society and get used to it instead of studying in the university as a student
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 47.04 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> you can (%hesitation%) get a greater (ep-) exposure to the university and society
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 6.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> factories and vehicles give off smoke and causes pollution
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 6.84 12.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then acid particles are in the smoke and with the wind acid particles are carried by it
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 12.65 20.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and during this procedure some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with the cloud water
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 20.59 24.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then in the clouds the acid particles form rain and snow
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 24.62 29.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and gradually it falls on the ground and cause damage to the environment
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 29.70 36.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the the acid particles will decay the soil and they will degrade the trees
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 36.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is the formation and effects of the acid rain

SI1267-00619-P50022 1 SI1267-00619 0.00 11.17 <o,Q4,C,P5> people need adequate sleep every night because the next morning (%hesitation%) they want to be a energetic person and they are ready for the challenges for the day

SI1267-00633-P50019 1 SI1267-00633 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the best way for a student to find international news is through newspaper for example or even by internet where you can find news of different countries

SI1267-00670-P40018 1 SI1267-00670 36.48 38.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you only have you wait
SI1267-00670-P40018 1 SI1267-00670 38.06 41.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so you can take something in the restaurants along the airport
SI1267-00670-P40018 1 SI1267-00670 41.99 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then you board and you are sitting and just waiting for coming to your destination
SI1267-00670-P50019 1 SI1267-00670 0.00 12.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that although technology has made a bad impact in (%hesitation%) student there is a lot of apps that can help (%hesitation%) to learn
SI1267-00670-P50019 1 SI1267-00670 12.02 15.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and now a lot of information it is available in the net
SI1267-00670-P50019 1 SI1267-00670 15.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so you have to try
SI1267-00670-P50020 1 SI1267-00670 0.00 11.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i totally agree with this statement (%hesitation%) because (no-) nothing can be (%hesitation%) better than a teacher because a teacher know your stabilities
SI1267-00670-P50020 1 SI1267-00670 11.54 15.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) but you can also a teacher through the internet
SI1267-00670-P50020 1 SI1267-00670 15.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's
SI1267-00670-P50021 1 SI1267-00670 0.00 6.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> a lot of skill could be developed by working in group projects
SI1267-00670-P50021 1 SI1267-00670 6.14 9.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe the best (%hesitation%) skill is communication
SI1267-00670-P50021 1 SI1267-00670 9.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because if you want to do a good project you will have to communication still with all your
SI1267-00670-P50022 1 SI1267-00670 0.00 6.42 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course attending lectures is more effective than learning alone

SI1267-00670-P50022 1 SI1267-00670 13.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and also you have a lot of argue what he is saying
SI1267-00670-P50023 1 SI1267-00670 0.00 11.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> schools must have these learning (%hesitation%) facilities because the way we live today is through internet through technology

SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 0.00 6.82 <o,Q5,C,P4> today let's talk about what you need to do and what do you need to prepare before you travelling by airplane
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 6.82 9.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> first you need to arrive the airports
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 9.62 15.83 <o,Q5,C,P4> whatever you use bus subway or taxi
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 15.83 24.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> after you arrive the airport you need to be checked in because the people at the airport (nee-) need to know where are who are you and where are you going
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 24.23 34.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that is the document country and control and the security (%hesitation%) check because that those things can make you have a safer trip
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 34.73 37.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after all those things you just need to wait
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 37.45 42.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) when you are wait you can have some food and go to (%hesitation%) restaurants
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 42.32 44.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> you even can buy something do some shopping
SI1267-00673-P40018 1 SI1267-00673 44.98 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after all those things done you just need to go aboard and have a bad trip
SI1267-00707-P40018 1 SI1267-00707 0.00 9.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> to go to airport you must use public transportation such as a car a train and a bus
SI1267-00707-P40018 1 SI1267-00707 9.16 13.96 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when you arrive at the airport you have to go to the place you can check in
SI1267-00707-P40018 1 SI1267-00707 13.96 23.49 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you get the airplane ticket next you must be checked if your document is correct and you can reach place doing security check
SI1267-00707-P40018 1 SI1267-00707 23.49 29.49 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after finish these steps you would have time to board on airplane
SI1267-00707-P40018 1 SI1267-00707 29.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when you can board on it you your travel will have begin
SI1267-00722-P10005 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 3.35 <o,Q4,B2,P1> where i live we have a lot of amenities

SI1267-00722-P10007 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 7.19 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy spending time with my sister because i do think that we really get along
SI1267-00722-P10007 1 SI1267-00722 7.19 13.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we have maybe not the same personality but we we (ha-) we always laugh
SI1267-00722-P10007 1 SI1267-00722 13.07 16.24 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we always are being silly with each other
SI1267-00722-P10007 1 SI1267-00722 16.24 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and that's it's a (mo-)
SI1267-00722-P10008 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 4.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in the future i would like to work in broadway
SI1267-00722-P10008 1 SI1267-00722 4.75 12.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to be a performer to sing and dance and act every day and get paid for it
SI1267-00722-P10008 1 SI1267-00722 12.72 17.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so yes to right now i'm working hard to achieve that goal
SI1267-00722-P10008 1 SI1267-00722 17.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 4.68 <o,Q4,C,P3> being a student is not an easy task
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 4.68 9.62 <o,Q4,C,P3> and well starting at college is doesn't get any easier
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 9.62 16.77 <o,Q4,C,P3> so having jobs while being at college can have advantages and disadvantages
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 16.77 28.80 <o,Q4,C,P3> some advantages are that you learn to to work for your money and to have something to work for in this case to pay for your studies
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 28.80 41.16 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) a disadvantage is that maybe you will not have enough time to spend in your hobbies (%hesitation%) with your friends or doing something else that you would prefer doing
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 41.16 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> and in my opinion i believe that it would be good to pay for our (studi-) studies but if we have the opportunity not to it will also be good
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 4.47 <o,Q4,C,P4> travelling by plane is not that easy
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 4.47 8.72 <o,Q4,C,P4> you have to pass several steps in order to get on board
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 8.72 26.27 <o,Q4,C,P4> at first you need to get to the airport on time and also to check in your luggage and yourself so that everything is set to leave to your destination
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 26.27 34.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you'll have to pass (%hesitation%) document control in order to the airport verify your identity
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 34.42 42.79 <o,Q4,C,P4> next you will then have to pass a security control so that everyone so that safety is essential
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 42.79 49.55 <o,Q4,C,P4> you will then have to wait for your plane to to arrive and to get on board
SI1267-00722-P40018 1 SI1267-00722 49.55 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you are on board you will just need to relax
SI1267-00722-P50019 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 4.54 <o,Q4,C,P5> technology is a really good source of information
SI1267-00722-P50019 1 SI1267-00722 4.54 13.68 <o,Q4,C,P5> so when studying you are able to get knowledge and material you need in in order to study and to have a good grade
SI1267-00722-P50019 1 SI1267-00722 13.68 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so yeah you can search online or in databases
SI1267-00722-P50020 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 5.12 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that there's something for everyone
SI1267-00722-P50020 1 SI1267-00722 5.12 15.06 <o,Q4,C,P5> so if you don't feel comfortable with face to face classes and interaction maybe (vir-) virtual learning is going to be more your thing
SI1267-00722-P50020 1 SI1267-00722 15.06 16.38 <o,Q4,C,P5> but it also may not be
SI1267-00722-P50020 1 SI1267-00722 16.38 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so face to face will be a more (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00722-P50021 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> there are several skills that you can practice and gain while being in group projects and some of them are the the communication also learning to work in teams because you may not always work with someone you like
SI1267-00722-P50022 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 8.78 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my personal opinion in and in also what works for me attending lectures is more kinda my thing
SI1267-00722-P50022 1 SI1267-00722 8.78 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i i learn thing i absorb knowledge more efficiently by attending lectures than by just reading on my own
SI1267-00722-P50023 1 SI1267-00722 0.00 8.90 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that everyone is different and sometimes what works for someone it doesn't necessarily work for everyone
SI1267-00722-P50023 1 SI1267-00722 8.90 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so learning facilities are a really necessary skill and (%hesitation%) ability and learning that you (mi-)
SI1267-00732-P10005 1 SI1267-00732 0.00 3.46 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i love the music

SI1267-00732-P10006 1 SI1267-00732 0.00 5.10 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i would like travelling to different places
SI1267-00732-P10006 1 SI1267-00732 5.10 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> but at the moment i can because (%hesitation%) we have a virus called covid ninety

SI1267-00732-P10008 1 SI1267-00732 0.00 15.72 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i think speak english in near future will be essential for me because i could get a good job if i improve my level english

SI1267-00732-P30017 1 SI1267-00732 0.00 12.93 <o,Q4,A2,P3> i think that the main advantage about the students learn at least one language is they would be more free
SI1267-00732-P30017 1 SI1267-00732 12.93 23.32 <o,Q4,A2,P3> because i think that (%hesitation%) to learn different language is the same than it get freedom
SI1267-00732-P30017 1 SI1267-00732 23.32 26.21 <o,Q4,A2,P3> i think so you know
SI1267-00732-P30017 1 SI1267-00732 26.21 43.84 <o,Q4,A2,P3> and on other hand the main disadvantage will be that the student who don't learn one different language they couldn't in order to pass the university course
SI1267-00732-P30017 1 SI1267-00732 43.84 53.22 <o,Q4,A2,P3> in my opinion it's a great idea because learn different language is the same that get more freedom

SI1267-00732-P50019 1 SI1267-00732 0.00 10.05 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think the best way to know international (we-) news is reading international newspaper
SI1267-00732-P50019 1 SI1267-00732 10.05 14.46 <o,Q5,A2,P5> nowadays you could found it online

SI1267-00800-P30017 1 SI1267-00800 53.71 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i don't think it should be a necessity to learn
SI1267-00800-P50019 1 SI1267-00800 0.00 10.96 <o,Q3,C,P5> i think the best way for students to find out about international news is through the media social media or watching the news on tv
SI1267-00800-P50019 1 SI1267-00800 10.96 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> it's always very easy to find out about international news through media because of the modern technology we have today
SI1267-00800-P50020 1 SI1267-00800 0.00 10.59 <o,Q3,C,P5> i do agree that in the future we do not need newspaper or won't have newspaper anymore because of the modern technology we have today
SI1267-00800-P50020 1 SI1267-00800 10.59 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> and the rapid changing of this will be no need to cut so many down the tree and it will save the earth
SI1267-00800-P50021 1 SI1267-00800 0.00 18.52 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion i don't think so social media is a reliable source of news because social media is a platform where people put their comments and their opinion on the social media
SI1267-00800-P50021 1 SI1267-00800 18.52 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so it's
SI1267-00800-P50022 1 SI1267-00800 0.00 4.92 <o,Q3,C,P5> it is very important to keep up with local news
SI1267-00800-P50022 1 SI1267-00800 4.92 18.32 <o,Q3,C,P5> you must always know what's happening around you especially your own country and to know the financial of the country what's happening to the country
SI1267-00800-P50022 1 SI1267-00800 18.32 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> you must always give
SI1267-00800-P50023 1 SI1267-00800 0.00 3.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> that's a lot of bad news in the media
SI1267-00800-P50023 1 SI1267-00800 3.75 6.88 <o,Q3,C,P5> but that's what people want to see
SI1267-00800-P50023 1 SI1267-00800 6.88 10.62 <o,Q3,C,P5> not a lot of people want to see about good news
SI1267-00800-P50023 1 SI1267-00800 10.62 15.12 <o,Q3,C,P5> so that's rarely people that's rarely that the media will show good news
SI1267-00800-P50023 1 SI1267-00800 15.12 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P5> but i do hope that in the future they will put more
SI1267-00806-P10005 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 5.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually enjoy learning about other countries because i love travelling
SI1267-00806-P10005 1 SI1267-00806 5.03 9.30 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite city is madrid because there is where my mother was born
SI1267-00806-P10005 1 SI1267-00806 9.30 13.21 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i have always had the opportunity to travel around europe
SI1267-00806-P10005 1 SI1267-00806 13.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so there is where my interests start in learning about other countries
SI1267-00806-P10006 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 4.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually enjoy watching films on weekends
SI1267-00806-P10006 1 SI1267-00806 4.29 12.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but if the weather is good i like to go out in a walk or in a hike to the mountains because i really like outdoor activities
SI1267-00806-P10006 1 SI1267-00806 12.84 14.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it will depend on the time i have
SI1267-00806-P10006 1 SI1267-00806 14.94 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but if the conditions allow it i
SI1267-00806-P10007 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 3.71 <o,Q4,B2,P1> there are several ways ways to improve my english
SI1267-00806-P10007 1 SI1267-00806 3.71 10.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but the most useful to me is to listen to podcast like the b b c ones that are really interesting
SI1267-00806-P10007 1 SI1267-00806 10.62 17.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and while i am learning about topics that i like i also improve my english and my fluently and also spelling
SI1267-00806-P10007 1 SI1267-00806 17.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> because in
SI1267-00806-P10008 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 9.15 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to learn another language because i am native spanish speaker and also i know how to speak english
SI1267-00806-P10008 1 SI1267-00806 9.15 18.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i would like to learn how to speak chinese because in the future i think that it is going to be the language of the world because there are lots of chinese people
SI1267-00806-P10008 1 SI1267-00806 18.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 5.28 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you asked me i don't agree at all with this statement
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 5.28 9.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 9.72 15.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion that's not a good idea because not all of them need to work
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 15.38 19.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some of them are very stressful and need time to prepare their exams
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 19.99 29.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so doing a part time jobs will be necessary to pay for their studies or to do something else because they have enough free time to do that
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 29.12 41.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in most areas like medicine or studying for being a lawyer you no have time enough to work or to get a job even if it is part time
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 41.41 50.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however there are also advantages of working in a part time job like you will gain experience and manage your time and also save
SI1267-00806-P30017 1 SI1267-00806 50.05 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i don't think it's for all the students of university
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 2.07 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello everybody
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 2.07 7.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today i will explain you the formation and effects of acid rain
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 7.18 18.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all vehicles and factories in cities generates pollution and creates acid particles that are in smoke forms
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 18.45 22.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried away by the wind
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 22.54 29.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the wind expands in all the air and some acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 29.95 33.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and some other acid particles mix with clouds
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 33.46 42.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the clouds in cold weathers creates rain and sometimes snow
SI1267-00806-P40018 1 SI1267-00806 42.91 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the rain and the snow are mixed with acid particles that fall in all the environment creating some important effects that damage the environment and the (ani-)
SI1267-00806-P50019 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i am of the opinion that people that want to develop good eating habits needs to eat fruit and vegetables every day at least five vegetables and two fruits and also avoid junk food and fatty food for example fries and fried chicken
SI1267-00806-P50020 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 1.92 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's really important
SI1267-00806-P50020 1 SI1267-00806 1.92 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> actually several studies had revealed that drinking two litres at water is the minimum than maintains your body alive especially for people that practice sports that need to hydratate more themselves than people that don't
SI1267-00806-P50021 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 10.71 <o,Q4,C,P5> although it's difficult to generalize about how many times people should practice sports i think that in main three times a week it's good
SI1267-00806-P50021 1 SI1267-00806 10.71 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> every day maybe too much for some people especially for those that has some issues or health problems
SI1267-00806-P50022 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 7.66 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i agree that people need to sleep and relax every day and eight hours should be a good idea
SI1267-00806-P50022 1 SI1267-00806 7.66 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but at the same time it's a very tough task because people don't have enough time to do all the activities that they need to do and also sleep that time
SI1267-00806-P50023 1 SI1267-00806 0.00 14.70 <o,Q4,C,P5> generally speaking i think technology has potential bad effects on people health because they spend too much in front of a screen every day at least six six hour while they are working
SI1267-00806-P50023 1 SI1267-00806 14.70 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and that reduce their active time to do sports (o-)
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 0.00 4.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> yeah first you have to go to airport
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 4.47 16.07 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can use any transportation tools maybe you can go by car buses or in subways or trains whatever you want you can choose it's your choice
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 16.07 20.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then after arriving airport (%hesitation%) you have to do a check in
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 20.91 31.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so if you are checked in (%hesitation%) next you have to go to the document control so you will be tested you know if you have enough visa or what qualification you gain
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 31.66 48.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then after that you have to proceed to the security and then your belongins and bags everything you have will be (%hesitation%) assessed and will be checked (%hesitation%) by the security (%hesitation%) using x ray or those kind of (%hesitation%) materials
SI1267-00816-P40018 1 SI1267-00816 48.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then once you pass the security you just wait for your flight and then once you've got the announcement of your flight it's the time you come on board
SI1267-00821-P10005 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 7.83 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as for me i'm very interested in learning about other countries because i love travelling
SI1267-00821-P10005 1 SI1267-00821 7.83 10.40 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is my hobby
SI1267-00821-P10005 1 SI1267-00821 10.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) with my friends we love visiting other countries in order to have fun to meet other people and to knew to know a new culture
SI1267-00821-P10006 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 10.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my view it is a very good way to spend your weekends or your free time with your family and friends
SI1267-00821-P10006 1 SI1267-00821 10.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00821-P10007 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 10.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my view it is a very good (%hesitation%) question because i would like to improve my english
SI1267-00821-P10007 1 SI1267-00821 10.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) (wha-) we are (%hesitation%) watching serials and talking with english speakers (%hesitation%) foreigners like
SI1267-00821-P10008 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as for the new skill (%hesitation%) if i could learn a new one i would choose to be (%hesitation%) humorous because i think that i don't have a very good sense of humor and i would like to learn how to be funny for everyone
SI1267-00821-P30017 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 27.78 <o,Q4,C,P3> as for me i believe that all university students should do the part time job (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) they need to have like their extra pocket money because if you want to buy something for yourself you don't need to ask money from your parents because you are an adult and you can earn money by yourself
SI1267-00821-P30017 1 SI1267-00821 27.78 33.12 <o,Q4,C,P3> and it's not very good way of living if you want to be dependent on someone
SI1267-00821-P30017 1 SI1267-00821 33.12 43.27 <o,Q4,C,P3> of course (%hesitation%) there are some disadvantages for example if you are working somewhere it means that you are a little bit distracted from your (%hesitation%) education
SI1267-00821-P30017 1 SI1267-00821 43.27 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion i believe that people young (c-) young teenagers like young students should (%hesitation%) work a part time job because it's very important to have some money in your pocket
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 26.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> air pollution has (%hesitation%) a very big impact on our (en-) environment because it (%hesitation%) causes damage to the our to our surroundings because vehicles and factories emit (%hesitation%) some very bad things (%hesitation%) for the our air the air that we breathe
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 26.92 29.62 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and acid particles are in the smoke
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 29.62 40.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they are carried by the winds into their clouds and some acid particles (al-) also fall as a dust for example on (%hesitation%) our grounds
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 40.70 43.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and other acid particles mix with the cloud water
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 43.46 48.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) it's (%hesitation%) after that it happens so that these particles are in the rain or snow
SI1267-00821-P40018 1 SI1267-00821 48.87 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they are (%hesitation%) pouring our heads for example (%hesitation%) when it's (%hesitation%) raining or snowing weather
SI1267-00821-P50019 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 15.24 <o,Q4,C,P5> if you want to develop a good eating habit you should (%hesitation%) eat more vegetables more fruits not to go to fast food restaurants because it's a (ve-) it is very good for our health
SI1267-00821-P50019 1 SI1267-00821 15.24 20.11 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) also you needs (%hesitation%) to do some exercises
SI1267-00821-P50020 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my humble opinion i believe that drinking water is very important because our body consists (%hesitation%) of water and mostly of water and it's very (%hesitation%) important to get this to keep this balance in our body
SI1267-00821-P50021 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 4.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> it is very essential (%hesitation%) to do exercises
SI1267-00821-P50021 1 SI1267-00821 4.96 19.16 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's an integral price of losing your weight for example because i believe that staying fit is very good right now and very important for each boy and girl also
SI1267-00821-P50021 1 SI1267-00821 19.16 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and not
SI1267-00821-P50022 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion people really need (%hesitation%) to sleep (%hesitation%) at least seven or eight hours a day because (%hesitation%) all the time they are in the stress situations like at work at the underground station for example or at (%hesitation%) their (univer-)
SI1267-00821-P50023 1 SI1267-00821 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that technology has a very good (%hesitation%) impact on our lives because (%hesitation%) it helps us not to waste our time on (%hesitation%) for example washing cleaning and it saves our time
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 0.00 1.79 <o,Q3,C,P4> hello everybody

SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 10.20 13.52 <o,Q3,C,P4> so first we have the factories and vehicles
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 13.52 19.33 <o,Q3,C,P4> in mexico the fifty percent of (%hesitation%) people use private vehicles
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 19.33 22.59 <o,Q3,C,P4> so the factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 22.59 26.38 <o,Q3,C,P4> the pollution (%hesitation%) is acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 26.38 30.42 <o,Q3,C,P4> and also the acid particles are carried by wind
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 30.42 34.64 <o,Q3,C,P4> and after that some acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 34.64 40.20 <o,Q3,C,P4> and well this is other acid particles mix with cool cold water
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 40.20 44.77 <o,Q3,C,P4> and almost done the acid particles are in or the rain or snow
SI1267-00827-P40018 1 SI1267-00827 44.77 48.38 <o,Q3,C,P4> and this cause the damage to environment

SI1267-00834-P10008 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 6.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i'm pretty sure that i will be a great researcher
SI1267-00834-P10008 1 SI1267-00834 6.95 13.14 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in fact today currently i work at the university as a researcher
SI1267-00834-P10008 1 SI1267-00834 13.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) in the future i would like (%hesitation%) important research
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 14.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) the students (%hesitation%) shouldn't get jobs to to pay the university because i think this universities are expensive
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 14.70 37.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) to pay the entire university year a student should have jobs with a complete (%hesitation%) schedule and with that they they will not have enough time to complete their studies
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 37.16 41.33 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's because of that that i disagree with that phrase
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 41.33 46.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think students shouldn't get jobs to pay their university
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 46.14 55.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they (%hesitation%) other people or institution have pay their studies in the university
SI1267-00834-P30017 1 SI1267-00834 55.99 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the students should only be focused on their
SI1267-00834-P50019 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> a student can use technology for better learning using difference kind of media support like videos and podcasts even video games for to facilitate their learning
SI1267-00834-P50020 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think when two peoples speak each other they they can argue about different issues and getting more information about it
SI1267-00834-P50021 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the most important skill that that students learn in group projects is to listen other people and attending their point of view
SI1267-00834-P50022 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 17.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my personal experience i think (%hesitation%) read alone is better than attending lecture because when you read alone you are more more concentrate and nobody distract you
SI1267-00834-P50022 1 SI1267-00834 17.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think is the best way to learn
SI1267-00834-P50023 1 SI1267-00834 0.00 6.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> university should facilitate (%hesitation%) the student (%hesitation%) learning
SI1267-00834-P50023 1 SI1267-00834 6.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they use (%hesitation%) modern learning (fati-) facilities like videos or other media in internet if is is best for the student is bad for the knowledge
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 0.00 7.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the picture we can see a diagram about how honey is made
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 7.10 12.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> bees com (%hesitation%) is there are five stage six stage
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 12.52 18.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and first of all we can see that bees collect nectar from flowers
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 18.87 26.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that bees make the honey from the nectar in the beha beehives
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 26.77 40.13 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) once the honey is made the beekeeper connect the honey from these places and put the honey inside of a car (%hesitation%) a can
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 40.13 46.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that (%hesitation%) we need to the the honey arrive to the supermarket
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 46.83 55.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> we can do that (%hesitation%) with with lorries because lorries can transport the honey to to the supermarket
SI1267-00837-P40018 1 SI1267-00837 55.88 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is the cycle of how honey is made

SI1267-00841-P30017 1 SI1267-00841 16.41 42.48 <o,Q5,A2,P3> i think by having period of practical work experience (i-) the student can experience very important about work
SI1267-00841-P30017 1 SI1267-00841 42.48 52.80 <o,Q5,A2,P3> but they lose the precious time to study
SI1267-00841-P30017 1 SI1267-00841 52.80 60.00 <o,Q5,A2,P3> so in my opinion university course should include a period

SI1267-00848-P40018 1 SI1267-00848 10.27 17.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can use your private car but there are also another option in public transport like in trolley or bus
SI1267-00848-P40018 1 SI1267-00848 17.46 25.37 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then when you are in the airport you have to look on your terminal and do the check in of your stuff
SI1267-00848-P40018 1 SI1267-00848 25.37 42.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> also you have to present your (age-) personal documents to the policeman and the security will (%hesitation%) check your (%hesitation%) personal stuff because there are some problems with terrorism in the past

SI1267-00869-P40018 1 SI1267-00869 0.00 9.33 <o,Q5,B1,P4> yes i'd like to present how (%hesitation%) pollution causes acid rain
SI1267-00869-P40018 1 SI1267-00869 9.33 14.18 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so it starts from the vehicles and or factories yeah

SI1267-00869-P40018 1 SI1267-00869 27.05 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and those polluted air particle go up to the air and acid particles are carried by wind or and go into the sun to some particle just directly fall to the ground as dust and also some others are included in rain and snow and fall down to the ground to damage the environment
SI1267-00874-P10005 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm interested in other countries because i can learn new cultures about the other countries
SI1267-00874-P10006 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i usually spend my free time playing video games listening to music and editing some videos
SI1267-00874-P10007 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my opinion the best way to improve your english is talking to other people and reading a lot of texts and writing as well
SI1267-00874-P10008 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 6.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> a new skill would be parkour like to climb things
SI1267-00874-P10008 1 SI1267-00874 6.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that would be really awesome
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 9.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages would be they will they would earn money from it (%hesitation%) on their jobs of course
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 9.82 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the (di-) disadvantages would be they wouldn't have time on studying
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 18.92 23.07 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so yeah that would be a a problem
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 23.07 30.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my opinion about it would be (n-) not worth it
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 30.22 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think they would just focus on studying
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 12.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so the pollution is caused by the vehicles and the factories that they release the c o two gasses
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 12.04 21.36 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) they will come (%hesitation%) on the particles (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) in the air the acid particles
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 21.36 25.60 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and they will be carried by the wind
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 25.60 29.93 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some acid (part-) particles will fall into the dust
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 29.93 35.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles will mix with the cloud water that it's raining
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 35.56 41.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and later on the acid particles they are going to be in the rain or snow
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 41.72 50.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then they're just going to rain and they're they are going to hit on the (%hesitation%) on trees
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 50.66 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is going to cause a (dama-) damage of (e-) environment
SI1267-00874-P50019 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> my advice would be that to eat more protein and eating more vegetables and meat also giving calories and having more energy
SI1267-00874-P50020 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's really important because you can be really hydrated and also it won't cause (%hesitation%) rocks in your kidney
SI1267-00874-P50021 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes it is essential to do exercises every day because not also will you will be (%hesitation%) healthy but you will stay in fit with (%hesitation%) with your body so it's really helpful doing every single day
SI1267-00874-P50022 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 17.32 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion it's it's important to sleep eight hours at at night coz will have you will have more energy on the other day like doing exercises or helping with your parents moving stuff
SI1267-00874-P50022 1 SI1267-00874 17.32 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's really important
SI1267-00874-P50023 1 SI1267-00874 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it has affect (%hesitation%) negative because all the time you will be sitting on your chair in front of your computer and then like you will you're just (%hesitation%) you're just there not literally doing nothing
SI1267-00878-P10005 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 5.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am so interested in music because it's my favourite hobby

SI1267-00878-P10007 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't really like famous person because i like music i like sport but me (%hesitation%) for me (%hesitation%) it would be more interesting meet some people who climbed everest than a person who play football
SI1267-00878-P10008 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 13.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for me speaking english is so important because (%hesitation%) i would like work away from here maybe in scotland or for instance ireland i don't know
SI1267-00878-P10008 1 SI1267-00878 13.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but (%hesitation%) i can see the films and read book in english in the
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 22.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages about all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass the university course (%hesitation%) i can see many coz (%hesitation%) in the future (%hesitation%) i think people like travel like (%hesitation%) meeting people and maybe they can find an obstacle is the language
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 22.48 28.71 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so if you are studying a new language you can many advantages about this
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 28.71 34.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other side the disadvantages (%hesitation%) i can't see many
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 34.50 44.37 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) if i need to say one maybe you need (%hesitation%) you you are (%hesitation%) losing time for your hobbies
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 44.37 45.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i don't know
SI1267-00878-P30017 1 SI1267-00878 45.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) so but in my (o-) own opinion like i said (%hesitation%) i think it's very important learn a foreigns language (%hesitation%) maybe two
SI1267-00878-P50019 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 8.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> nowadays we have a lot of advantages for find something (%hesitation%) in the internet
SI1267-00878-P50019 1 SI1267-00878 8.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so or you can take just you can take your mobile phone or your computer research in google something and you can see the news about the (wor-) around the world
SI1267-00878-P50020 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 5.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think so for the same reason that i told before
SI1267-00878-P50020 1 SI1267-00878 5.77 13.78 <o,Q5,B2,P5> is because (%hesitation%) (nowad-) nowadays we have more and more new technologies
SI1267-00878-P50020 1 SI1267-00878 13.78 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so in the future the paper the paper is going to disappear because we have the
SI1267-00878-P50021 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah maybe the social media can change the the news or you can find out the in whatever social media whatever you want because all the people always have their (mo-) mobile phone
SI1267-00878-P50022 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 9.37 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me is the most important (%hesitation%) daily because is the place where you live and live in
SI1267-00878-P50022 1 SI1267-00878 9.37 16.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you need to know what is happening or what is going to happen also
SI1267-00878-P50022 1 SI1267-00878 16.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but yeah you (sh-)
SI1267-00878-P50023 1 SI1267-00878 0.00 7.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well maybe because nowadays there are a lot of disasters
SI1267-00878-P50023 1 SI1267-00878 7.76 13.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we are polluting the pollution is growing up more and more
SI1267-00878-P50023 1 SI1267-00878 13.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) but sometimes they write some things new good you know
SI1267-00879-P10005 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 1.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> i love music
SI1267-00879-P10005 1 SI1267-00879 1.97 11.70 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i always (%hesitation%) try to listen to all kinds of music and all kinds of of genres (%hesitation%) from death metal to (%hesitation%) classic music
SI1267-00879-P10005 1 SI1267-00879 11.70 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i always tried (%hesitation%) and have a different opinions and different people recommending me different types of music
SI1267-00879-P10006 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 2.25 <o,Q4,C,P1> i absolutely love it
SI1267-00879-P10006 1 SI1267-00879 2.25 9.17 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) to be honest if i had the time i would definitely (%hesitation%) visit a lot more places
SI1267-00879-P10006 1 SI1267-00879 9.17 12.23 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i wanted to visit mexico (%hesitation%) last month
SI1267-00879-P10006 1 SI1267-00879 12.23 15.67 <o,Q4,C,P1> it wasn't possible (%hesitation%) due to the covid situation
SI1267-00879-P10006 1 SI1267-00879 15.67 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but but yeah i love to travel and to (n-)
SI1267-00879-P10007 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 7.64 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think that without a doubt it will it will be (%hesitation%) an actor and (%hesitation%) specifically i think it would be leonardo dicaprio
SI1267-00879-P10007 1 SI1267-00879 7.64 9.47 <o,Q4,C,P1> i always been a a huge fan of him
SI1267-00879-P10007 1 SI1267-00879 9.47 17.60 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) there's another whole set of actors that i would absolutely love to meet of course like colin farrell or (%hesitation%) robert de niro
SI1267-00879-P10007 1 SI1267-00879 17.60 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but yeah
SI1267-00879-P10008 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 11.88 <o,Q4,C,P1> to be honest (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i'm simply talking like (%hesitation%) if i if i pass this test it will help me in the future because (%hesitation%) i would be able to attend to this master that i'm looking forward to
SI1267-00879-P10008 1 SI1267-00879 11.88 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) so if i get a good grade on this (%hesitation%) i could definitely improve a lot in my future in my career
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 12.06 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think studying a foreign (coun-) a foreign language (%hesitation%) in order to pass (%hesitation%) an university course (%hesitation%) for student has its (%hesitation%) good side and bad sides
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 12.06 23.13 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) on one hand the advantages that you get is that you attain a new a new language that is it's it's a skill (%hesitation%) that is really valued in the in the real world
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 23.13 28.63 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand the disadvantages are that (%hesitation%) you can get quite lost at the beginning
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 28.63 38.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> and it's really difficult for people who are (%hesitation%) at that age to become familiar with all the (%hesitation%) difficulties of learning a new (netwo-) language
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 38.92 50.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) it's really discouraging at first to be honest because people don't know how to deal with (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) especial curiosities that each (%hesitation%) language has
SI1267-00879-P30017 1 SI1267-00879 50.92 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) if it's for example (%hesitation%) (li-) an an easy language like for example spanish or maybe english but if it's german like for (ex-)
SI1267-00879-P50019 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 2.75 <o,Q4,C,P5> for me it's very it's very clear
SI1267-00879-P50019 1 SI1267-00879 2.75 11.07 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i tend to use (%hesitation%) internet (%hesitation%) and my mobile phone to check some newspapers that i really like
SI1267-00879-P50019 1 SI1267-00879 11.07 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) once i (%hesitation%) verify all the information that it's there that it's true (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i just talk
SI1267-00879-P50020 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 1.76 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah i certainly agree
SI1267-00879-P50020 1 SI1267-00879 1.76 8.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the the concept of a newspaper as (%hesitation%) as a thing made of paper (%hesitation%) it would eventually fade in time
SI1267-00879-P50020 1 SI1267-00879 8.75 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) but i think that (%hesitation%) yeah (%hesitation%) online newspapers will will will take the (%hesitation%) will take the slack and (%hesitation%) there'll be other ways to inform yourself
SI1267-00879-P50021 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 1.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> no not at all
SI1267-00879-P50021 1 SI1267-00879 1.44 5.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think that social media is a reliable source of (%hesitation%) information
SI1267-00879-P50021 1 SI1267-00879 5.84 16.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is a source of information don't get me wrong but i think that it's not reliable just because of the fact that (%hesitation%) it's influenced by people opinion by people's opinions
SI1267-00879-P50021 1 SI1267-00879 16.11 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) yeah that's the (re-) main reason why
SI1267-00879-P50022 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 5.03 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's (%hesitation%) it is of the utmost (%hesitation%) importance
SI1267-00879-P50022 1 SI1267-00879 5.03 10.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> i myself i check (%hesitation%) local news almost every day
SI1267-00879-P50022 1 SI1267-00879 10.38 12.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> for me it's something sacred to say the least
SI1267-00879-P50022 1 SI1267-00879 12.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) each day i put the tv on and i check in the (n-) online newspaper to get a grip of what is going
SI1267-00879-P50023 1 SI1267-00879 0.00 11.55 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that bad news are usually the typical stuff just because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it's not (%hesitation%) something of importance that the things are going well
SI1267-00879-P50023 1 SI1267-00879 11.55 14.32 <o,Q5,C,P5> everyone expects things (%hesitation%) going well
SI1267-00879-P50023 1 SI1267-00879 14.32 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> what nobody expects is things going go pretty bad and the situation getting out of hand
SI1267-00896-P40018 1 SI1267-00896 0.00 13.28 <o,Q5,B1,P4> now we are talking about acid rain so we are (%hesitation%) started with the pollution that some factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) generate to the atmosphere
SI1267-00896-P40018 1 SI1267-00896 13.28 25.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so this acid particulars from the pollution are in the smoke and go (%hesitation%) to the atmosphere (%hesitation%) and they are moving with the wind
SI1267-00896-P40018 1 SI1267-00896 25.59 36.20 <o,Q5,B1,P4> some of these particulars (%hesitation%) go down so quickly because (%hesitation%) they fall to the to the water or to the other plants
SI1267-00896-P40018 1 SI1267-00896 36.20 53.75 <o,Q5,B1,P4> but there are some other particulars that have less weight that are maintained in the atmosphere and go down to the (%hesitation%) different plants or or to the water (%hesitation%) through rain or snow
SI1267-00896-P40018 1 SI1267-00896 53.75 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and these acid particulars damage the environment of our
SI1267-00903-P10005 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 15.04 <o,Q5,B1,P1> yeah is a very quiet place to live (%hesitation%) that that provides security and safety
SI1267-00903-P10005 1 SI1267-00903 15.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and it's good it's ok
SI1267-00903-P10006 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 6.27 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i really enjoy hiking for instance
SI1267-00903-P10006 1 SI1267-00903 6.27 13.36 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i also go to the beach with my friends with my girlfriend with family
SI1267-00903-P10006 1 SI1267-00903 13.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i love travelling
SI1267-00903-P10007 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 2.97 <o,Q5,B1,P1> certainly with my sister
SI1267-00903-P10007 1 SI1267-00903 2.97 8.37 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my sister is a really really funny person
SI1267-00903-P10007 1 SI1267-00903 8.37 15.55 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i have a great time when i i'm with her
SI1267-00903-P10007 1 SI1267-00903 15.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> we spend a lot of time together
SI1267-00903-P10008 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 12.91 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future i would like to be working in my (p-) in the profession i have studied (%hesitation%) which is laboral consulture
SI1267-00903-P10008 1 SI1267-00903 12.91 16.39 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i really like that job
SI1267-00903-P10008 1 SI1267-00903 16.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'd like
SI1267-00903-P50019 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think technology is making the people's life easier as we the current problem called coronavirus we are progressing to a
SI1267-00903-P50020 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 9.67 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think face to face education allow for quicker feedback and is less complex
SI1267-00903-P50020 1 SI1267-00903 9.67 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> whereas the online education is more complex and less adaptative to students
SI1267-00903-P50021 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 11.30 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the communication among students or workers or colleagues whatever it's very important
SI1267-00903-P50021 1 SI1267-00903 11.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and move a project forward is difficult and facility the
SI1267-00903-P50022 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah is help to know (%hesitation%) given point of view of partners and to learn more abilities or skills or provide
SI1267-00903-P50023 1 SI1267-00903 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think is more important than even before than ever before because with the current situation called coronavirus (%hesitation%) we need a modern learning online
SI1267-00906-P40018 1 SI1267-00906 0.00 9.67 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so smoke that comes from (%hesitation%) factories and vehicles possesses acid particles
SI1267-00906-P40018 1 SI1267-00906 9.67 13.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these acid particles are carried out by the winds
SI1267-00906-P40018 1 SI1267-00906 13.46 40.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and some of them fall as dust into rivers and these kinds of natural environments and actually pollute them while other acid particles mix with cloud water and then they fall in the form of rain or snow also into our environments (%hesitation%) which causes this enormous damaging to the environment
SI1267-00906-P40018 1 SI1267-00906 40.04 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so this is how pollution actually causes acid rain
SI1267-00915-P10006 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 4.58 <o,Q4,C,P1> i extremely enjoy travelling to different places
SI1267-00915-P10006 1 SI1267-00915 4.58 9.86 <o,Q4,C,P1> i always enjoy the weather the new landscapes (%hesitation%) the monuments
SI1267-00915-P10006 1 SI1267-00915 9.86 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think (%hesitation%) my best time and my most agreeable (%hesitation%) moments is when i'm travelling to another country or to another
SI1267-00915-P10007 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 4.23 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i have to say oprah
SI1267-00915-P10007 1 SI1267-00915 4.23 6.50 <o,Q4,C,P1> she is a role model for me
SI1267-00915-P10007 1 SI1267-00915 6.50 10.62 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i have always dreamed about meeting her and speaking to her
SI1267-00915-P10007 1 SI1267-00915 10.62 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> she is an amazing person such a humble soul and a cute lovely face with with this life journey
SI1267-00915-P10008 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 4.32 <o,Q4,C,P1> think english is totally beneficial for me
SI1267-00915-P10008 1 SI1267-00915 4.32 15.35 <o,Q4,C,P1> i'm working on improving my english because i am dreaming about travelling to another country and starting a new (%hesitation%) business and having a new life there
SI1267-00915-P10008 1 SI1267-00915 15.35 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so the first and the most important (%hesitation%) step that is to
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 13.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> (ome-) people (%hesitation%) say that university students must learn a new language beside their native language so that they can finish their tertiary education
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 13.79 18.77 <o,Q5,C,P3> well on the one hand i believe that learning a new language is a great idea
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 18.77 32.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> and it's totally advantageous for students because they will be more educated and that (%hesitation%) will help them work better in the future especially with developed countries such as china and japan
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 32.16 41.68 <o,Q5,C,P3> well (%hesitation%) on the other hand i reckon learning a new language should not be a condition to get a degree because learning a new language might be hard
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 41.68 47.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in some cases it might be unnecessary for some majors such as law and medicine
SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 47.95 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my from my point of view i suppose students can study a new language but it should not be it should be their choice and universities must encourage them for that
SI1267-00915-P50019 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i believe social media is the best way to know about international news and domestic news at the same time as all the (%hesitation%) big media maybe newspapers or even channels all of them have (%hesitation%) facebook or
SI1267-00915-P50020 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 3.14 <o,Q5,C,P5> well absolutely
SI1267-00915-P50020 1 SI1267-00915 3.14 4.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> i believe that too
SI1267-00915-P50020 1 SI1267-00915 4.81 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and actually i believe everything is going to be (%hesitation%) like online and no more paper will be used on newspapers and we can find all the information on their website
SI1267-00915-P50021 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 18.35 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i'm in two minds on this one because when you (%hesitation%) have the news (%hesitation%) from the formal (%hesitation%) website of the win newspaper maybe this is yes reliable but (%hesitation%) some pages just (%hesitation%) have fake news
SI1267-00915-P50021 1 SI1267-00915 18.35 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> this is not (real-) really about
SI1267-00915-P50022 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 16.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's absolutely important because you may want to know how the roads are today if there is any problem specially when (%hesitation%) within countries that has (%hesitation%) like some kind of conflict or whatever
SI1267-00915-P50022 1 SI1267-00915 16.44 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we must know (%hesitation%) how the roads
SI1267-00915-P50023 1 SI1267-00915 0.00 6.52 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think this is normal because a bad news just attract people
SI1267-00915-P50023 1 SI1267-00915 6.52 16.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> people are always fascinated about the tragedy and death and all the bad things that happen to other people but don't happen to them
SI1267-00915-P50023 1 SI1267-00915 16.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so they find it really relieving maybe
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 0.00 9.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if only people (wou-) would know how important the bees are not only for the honey but also for the environment
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 9.14 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) anyway what matters now in this presentation is how they (%hesitation%) do the honey
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 16.38 25.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all the bees are known to collect (%hesitation%) nectar from different flowers around and they carry it to their beehives
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 25.66 44.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) if there is enough (%hesitation%) a person in charge (%hesitation%) the beekeeper can collect all the honey from the beehives and put it in a jar which is hermetically closed and carried to the supermarkets to be selled
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 44.66 49.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is (%hesitation%) kind of a simple process if we tell it like this
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 49.83 53.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but it's really complex and it requires a lot of time
SI1267-00916-P40018 1 SI1267-00916 53.60 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) bees now are in danger of (extin-) extinction

SI1267-00920-P40018 1 SI1267-00920 5.38 12.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) it all starts in the factories and fumes that pollute the air and also the (vehi-) the vehicles
SI1267-00920-P40018 1 SI1267-00920 12.63 22.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) acid particles (%hesitation%) are sent into the atmosphere and can be carried by wind (%hesitation%) well are carried by wind
SI1267-00920-P40018 1 SI1267-00920 22.66 33.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the (th-) this wind gusts (%hesitation%) can be (%hesitation%) mixed for example with cloud water or can be (f-) or can fall as dust
SI1267-00920-P40018 1 SI1267-00920 33.86 39.13 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) both of them will have (%hesitation%) serious damage to the environment

SI1267-00938-P50019 1 SI1267-00938 0.00 16.30 <o,Q4,B1,P5> nowadays the best way to find international news is (%hesitation%) search on the internet or only watching the news on the tv

SI1267-00938-P50021 1 SI1267-00938 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't think so because (%hesitation%) social media show us a lot of fake news and they try to to show us what they want and in what they are interesting
SI1267-00938-P50022 1 SI1267-00938 0.00 16.27 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that there are a lot of important because you everybody should know all the events who has passing which has passing in his local area around them
SI1267-00938-P50022 1 SI1267-00938 16.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so all people have to interesting in

SI1267-00942-P40018 1 SI1267-00942 3.26 15.17 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i would love to talk about (%hesitation%) how the acid rain is produced and how the acid rain damage to the environment
SI1267-00942-P40018 1 SI1267-00942 15.17 24.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first (%hesitation%) pollution is produced from factories and then after that (ac-) acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00942-P40018 1 SI1267-00942 24.99 29.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then acid particle are carried by wind

SI1267-00942-P40018 1 SI1267-00942 42.75 47.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then acid particles are in rain or snow
SI1267-00942-P40018 1 SI1267-00942 47.42 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and if it's rain or snow it damage to the environment and it damage to (%hesitation%) plants
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 0.00 4.48 <o,Q4,B1,P4> please look at the diagram
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 4.48 15.74 <o,Q4,B1,P4> as you can see the diagram shows the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 15.74 24.98 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i would like to talk about what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 24.98 36.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first you need to go to your airport by using car or a train
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 36.70 48.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and you need to check in at airport and pass the document control security
SI1267-00943-P40018 1 SI1267-00943 48.34 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and until your plane arrive arrive you wait and go to washroom and take coffee
SI1267-00946-P10005 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 11.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm interested in the environment of my nearby parks because there have many flowers and some dogs (t-) inside it
SI1267-00946-P10005 1 SI1267-00946 11.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i often go there (d-) for (re-) for walks and relax myself
SI1267-00946-P10006 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we are usually going hang out and suchlike going to the shopping centre and watch a video game and watch the recent (cin-) the recent films
SI1267-00946-P10007 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that is be my mother because we have a same personalities like an (o-) an optimistic attitude towards life that we often face the problems in a positive way
SI1267-00946-P10008 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to lived in new york because the city are more (organisa-) organisinged and are more opening are more open for me and other have the cultures
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 10.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i think the school day for all students to do the fitness class have several advantage
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 10.27 28.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the first one is that student can keep fit while doing the fitness classes and they can relax themself to relieve the the pressures from the study and then they can have a good shape of body
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 28.40 44.21 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the advantage but the disadvantage of the taking fitness classes is that the time when it used to be in study are take up by the fitness class so the student have less time to study
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 44.21 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i support the fitness class (d-) and it is very essential for all student to do it
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 7.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today i'm talking about how the honey process from flower to shop
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 7.74 12.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first stage involved bees collect nectar from flowers
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 12.79 17.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then bees are make the honey from nectar in beehives
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 17.86 28.84 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the following steps the professional (pe-) beekeepers they will collect the honeys from beehives and then put them into the bottoms
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 28.84 35.26 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after doing this a card will be carried this honey to the supermarket
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 35.26 39.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the honey will be selled to the shop
SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 39.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is the process of honey this is the process of honey from flower to shop
SI1267-00946-P50019 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 10.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> when a student to choosing a country they would better to search the internet for some details information about the countries
SI1267-00946-P50019 1 SI1267-00946 10.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they can asks their parent for some suggestion about the countries and the give advice
SI1267-00946-P50020 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 12.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the study in a second language is that the people will have the more choice to choose the job and they can learn they can travelling around the world by themselves
SI1267-00946-P50020 1 SI1267-00946 12.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they also can get along well with the foreigners
SI1267-00946-P50021 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 11.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in a in my opinion the difficulty of study in another country for a student is that there're a obstacle obstacle of the languages
SI1267-00946-P50021 1 SI1267-00946 11.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so they are usually short of confidence to speak out what they want
SI1267-00946-P50022 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 6.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can make friends the with their with make friends with their classmates
SI1267-00946-P50022 1 SI1267-00946 6.09 13.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and then they can talk about the local culture while they are (%hesitation%) talking in app
SI1267-00946-P50022 1 SI1267-00946 13.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) correspondingly they can read (%hesitation%) more books to to study
SI1267-00946-P50023 1 SI1267-00946 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i agree this opinions that studying abroad (%hesitation%) make the people become independence because there're many things that you need to do just by yourself so like going to the shopping centre or (%hesitation%) cooking the meals the for yourself
SI1267-00948-P40018 1 SI1267-00948 0.00 12.46 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the factories are doing their production activity or when we are (%hesitation%) going by the roads with our vehicles generate pollution which can be very necessive for the environment later
SI1267-00948-P40018 1 SI1267-00948 12.46 21.67 <o,Q4,C,P4> this pollution ascend to the sky in form of smoke and is compound by acid particles which (%hesitation%) will be later carried by wind
SI1267-00948-P40018 1 SI1267-00948 21.67 27.99 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) these particles can (%hesitation%) fall to their ground in form of dust and damage the environment a little

SI1267-00948-P40018 1 SI1267-00948 37.17 55.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the acid particles mix with the cloud water (%hesitation%) and rains (%hesitation%) the rain who falls to the ground is (%hesitation%) called (%hesitation%) acid rain which can be very (%hesitation%) hazardous for the environment and is one of the main reason for (%hesitation%) deforestation of the forest
SI1267-00948-P40018 1 SI1267-00948 55.08 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> so you we should take this into account in order to reduce our (emiss-)

SI1267-00965-P40018 1 SI1267-00965 19.65 34.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> finally clouds (%hesitation%) go to other lands and they get cold and finally the water the polluted water goes down by the raining
SI1267-00965-P40018 1 SI1267-00965 34.06 45.19 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally it can kill it can kill trees and harvest and at the same way it affects lakes and rivers
SI1267-00965-P40018 1 SI1267-00965 45.19 54.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally the rivers makes the polluting water returned to the sea where it contaminates even more than before

SI1267-01029-P30017 1 SI1267-01029 19.28 23.11 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) what about the disadvantages
SI1267-01029-P30017 1 SI1267-01029 23.11 37.83 <o,Q4,C,P3> so some of the drawbacks are that (%hesitation%) that the students will have (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) tighter schedules so they might be stressful
SI1267-01029-P30017 1 SI1267-01029 37.83 54.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> however from my point of view there are far more benefits than drawbacks and personally i will really recommend to to gain working experience while studying at the university

SI1267-01081-P30017 1 SI1267-01081 9.78 20.47 <o,Q4,C,P3> on one hand the advantage is that you obligate and make compulsory that all students know a foreign language besides their mother tongue language

SI1267-01112-P40018 1 SI1267-01112 20.29 25.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these first collect the nectar from flowers all around the forest and the countryside

SI1267-01123-P10006 1 SI1267-01123 16.66 17.84 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so that's my answer
SI1267-01123-P10006 1 SI1267-01123 17.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i love travel
SI1267-01123-P10007 1 SI1267-01123 0.00 2.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well that's good question
SI1267-01123-P10007 1 SI1267-01123 2.00 8.18 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe that jackie chan is my favourite person to meet because i love him very much

SI1267-01123-P10008 1 SI1267-01123 6.16 14.45 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe in the future it will help me to communicate with the different kind of people the foreign people who are in the company
SI1267-01123-P10008 1 SI1267-01123 14.45 18.74 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it will help me to do the different kind of jobs
SI1267-01123-P10008 1 SI1267-01123 18.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> that's
SI1267-01123-P30017 1 SI1267-01123 0.00 23.16 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the advantage of the students should at least learn a foreign language to pass their university course is th if they learn a the second language they will get more experience and (%hesitation%) have other skills to find the job in the future
SI1267-01123-P30017 1 SI1267-01123 23.16 35.60 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the disadvantages is you know the students will need almost one year or two years to learn this foreign language
SI1267-01123-P30017 1 SI1267-01123 35.60 38.77 <o,Q5,B1,P3> it's quite a little waste of time
SI1267-01123-P30017 1 SI1267-01123 38.77 49.52 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think (%hesitation%) the students can choose they want to learn another language or they don't need to learn by themself
SI1267-01123-P30017 1 SI1267-01123 49.52 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> you know in sometimes (%hesitation%) children choose by themself can get a better

SI1267-01123-P50020 1 SI1267-01123 3.95 17.07 <o,Q5,B1,P5> although the newspaper's lower than before but maybe in an (a-) (%hesitation%) in the future the retired people still need to read a newspaper although the teenagers use the cell phone

SI1267-01123-P50021 1 SI1267-01123 0.00 13.20 <o,Q5,B1,P5> actually in my opinion social media is not reliable because too much social media companies to competition the same things
SI1267-01123-P50021 1 SI1267-01123 13.20 16.92 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so a a part of them they go say the fake news

SI1267-01136-P50019 1 SI1267-01136 0.00 7.90 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the best way for students to get international news is just to see the domestic media
SI1267-01136-P50019 1 SI1267-01136 7.90 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> recently domestic media is interested in international news so international news is available enough from the domestic media
SI1267-01136-P50020 1 SI1267-01136 0.00 4.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with the opinion
SI1267-01136-P50020 1 SI1267-01136 4.16 8.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in the future newspaper will be no more
SI1267-01136-P50020 1 SI1267-01136 8.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion the news media is available on smartphone but the newspaper is just a waste of paper
SI1267-01136-P50021 1 SI1267-01136 0.00 6.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think at all that the social media is available for source of news
SI1267-01136-P50021 1 SI1267-01136 6.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> recently there are so many people who tell lies in social media so you have to have a skill to identify if the news is true or false
SI1267-01136-P50022 1 SI1267-01136 0.00 5.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is very important to keep up local news
SI1267-01136-P50022 1 SI1267-01136 5.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by reading the local news they can see what is happening or what's happened in the local area
SI1267-01136-P50023 1 SI1267-01136 0.00 6.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also think that there are too much bad news in the social media recently
SI1267-01136-P50023 1 SI1267-01136 6.34 12.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> actually social media tend to write about the news worse than usual
SI1267-01136-P50023 1 SI1267-01136 12.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is not good
SI1267-01140-P40018 1 SI1267-01140 0.00 14.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> before boarding a airplane you have to do many thing and i will introduce you (%hesitation%) what you have to do
SI1267-01140-P40018 1 SI1267-01140 14.70 28.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first you have to go to the airport by your car or bus or (%hesitation%) train and you (ha-) then you have to check checking in
SI1267-01140-P40018 1 SI1267-01140 28.50 37.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you you have to pass document control and security
SI1267-01140-P40018 1 SI1267-01140 37.56 48.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and so when you are at security office you will investigate whether you carry dangerous things or not
SI1267-01140-P40018 1 SI1267-01140 48.50 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you will wait for the for minute and you can board the airplane
SI1267-01141-P10005 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i am so interested in learning about other countries because it give you a new opportunity for your future and it can be a good opportunity for know new people
SI1267-01141-P10006 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 6.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy in my free time (%hesitation%) make some exercise for example i like play football
SI1267-01141-P10006 1 SI1267-01141 6.91 11.38 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-01141-P10006 1 SI1267-01141 11.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> or maybe if i am tired i only read a book or watch a film at home
SI1267-01141-P10007 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that the best way for me (%hesitation%) to improve my english is watching some english film with (%hesitation%) someone or (%hesitation%) i can read the newspaper (%hesitation%) which can give vocabulary
SI1267-01141-P10008 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i can (%hesitation%) learn a new skill i would like to learn about cooking because (%hesitation%) i am not very well in in the kitchen and i would like to be the best
SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 10.63 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) about if the students should do part jobs when they are studying (%hesitation%) we can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage
SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 10.63 25.28 <o,Q4,C,P3> for example one advantage is that this job can give them some experience for their future and with this experience (%hesitation%) they can (%hesitation%) have more opportunities
SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 25.28 37.84 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but we can see one important disadvantage (%hesitation%) and this is when they are working this time is not for studying
SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 37.84 45.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> so maybe these people that will work hasn't (%hesitation%) the best exam note
SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 45.88 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i think that all the students should have a part time jobs because it's very important for them to gain some experience
SI1267-01141-P50019 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 18.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my advice to the people that want to have (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) good eating habits is to eat some salad some vegetables but (%hesitation%) not only this you can eat some meal some meat or fish
SI1267-01141-P50019 1 SI1267-01141 18.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but
SI1267-01141-P50020 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 9.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> drinking water is the most important thing that you should do in your life because you're water and you need water
SI1267-01141-P50020 1 SI1267-01141 9.13 12.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's something that all the people need
SI1267-01141-P50020 1 SI1267-01141 12.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's the best drinking that you can take
SI1267-01141-P50021 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-01141-P50022 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 6.28 <o,Q4,B2,P5> actually not for all people is the same time for sleeping
SI1267-01141-P50022 1 SI1267-01141 6.28 10.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example (%hesitation%) young people need more time than the old people
SI1267-01141-P50022 1 SI1267-01141 10.64 16.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the old people can sleep during eight hour
SI1267-01141-P50022 1 SI1267-01141 16.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but the young people maybe
SI1267-01141-P50023 1 SI1267-01141 0.00 16.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> people say it is it have the technology have negative effects because all of technology have addiction that (%hesitation%) can make you feel bad
SI1267-01141-P50023 1 SI1267-01141 16.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in the at the moment
SI1267-01153-P10005 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 10.64 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that music make you feel (%hesitation%) better when you are stressed or you need to have a break
SI1267-01153-P10005 1 SI1267-01153 10.64 13.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i love (%hesitation%) listening music
SI1267-01153-P10005 1 SI1267-01153 13.95 18.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i listen music (%hesitation%) every single time i have
SI1267-01153-P10005 1 SI1267-01153 18.81 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and
SI1267-01153-P10006 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 9.05 <o,Q5,B2,P1> this one is one of my best hobbies and now with the situation with the pandemic it's very difficult
SI1267-01153-P10006 1 SI1267-01153 9.05 18.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but (%hesitation%) i i've visited (%hesitation%) four continents (%hesitation%) of the five we have
SI1267-01153-P10006 1 SI1267-01153 18.23 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i really would like to
SI1267-01153-P10007 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 11.59 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-01153-P10007 1 SI1267-01153 11.59 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) he's very proud of (%hesitation%) his country and try to to speak about it everywhere he goes
SI1267-01153-P10008 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 10.40 <o,Q5,B2,P1> at the end english language is the international language and we how (t-) how we (communi-) communicate with different countries
SI1267-01153-P10008 1 SI1267-01153 10.40 19.48 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so when you are (tr-) when you are finding a job or you want to work in on an international company it's compulsory to speak this language
SI1267-01153-P10008 1 SI1267-01153 19.48 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and
SI1267-01153-P30017 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 10.20 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) nowadays (%hesitation%) to speak another language that is not your first language is very very important
SI1267-01153-P30017 1 SI1267-01153 10.20 22.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think (%hesitation%) here you can find an advantage when (%hesitation%) you need to study at least one foreign language to pass (%hesitation%) the university course
SI1267-01153-P30017 1 SI1267-01153 22.81 41.94 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) but it's not necessary to have a big (%hesitation%) grade just to know how to speak it (%hesitation%) because it's not fair for people who are not goods they are not good at speaking another languages
SI1267-01153-P30017 1 SI1267-01153 41.94 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's it's positive but at the same time not like (%hesitation%) very very very very important like not (%hesitation%) they're you're not going to fall fail
SI1267-01153-P50019 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 8.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think nowadays the best way to know about international news is diving on the internet
SI1267-01153-P50019 1 SI1267-01153 8.47 20.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> you're going to find it quickly (%hesitation%) very good very well detail (%hesitation%) and you're gonna find it really easy
SI1267-01153-P50020 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 12.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree coz (%hesitation%) to produce newspapers is very expensive for the number of of (%hesitation%) newspapers that people buy
SI1267-01153-P50020 1 SI1267-01153 12.98 16.97 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's cheaper and easier to do it online
SI1267-01153-P50020 1 SI1267-01153 16.97 19.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) but it depends of the tendency
SI1267-01153-P50020 1 SI1267-01153 19.54 20.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%)
SI1267-01153-P50021 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 17.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) no way coz there are a lot of fake news today and in (so-) social media everybody can say whatever he wants and if everybody can say it there is not a reliable information about it
SI1267-01153-P50021 1 SI1267-01153 17.07 20.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) it just an opinion or
SI1267-01153-P50022 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 4.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's crucial because it's very near of you
SI1267-01153-P50022 1 SI1267-01153 4.39 8.25 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's going (t-) it's going to affect you directly
SI1267-01153-P50022 1 SI1267-01153 8.25 11.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> so you should be (%hesitation%) inform
SI1267-01153-P50022 1 SI1267-01153 11.47 16.17 <o,Q5,C,P5> and also that information is going to make you act different
SI1267-01153-P50022 1 SI1267-01153 16.17 20.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i think it's (%hesitation%) really important to to be
SI1267-01153-P50023 1 SI1267-01153 0.00 3.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's completely true
SI1267-01153-P50023 1 SI1267-01153 3.46 9.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) sadly (%hesitation%) there are more bad (n-) bad news than good news
SI1267-01153-P50023 1 SI1267-01153 9.95 20.24 <o,Q5,C,P5> and i think also (%hesitation%) the media try to to underline more the bad news

SI1267-01155-P40018 1 SI1267-01155 5.64 11.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and we know there are very popular apps like spotify which people download music from

SI1267-01189-P50022 1 SI1267-01189 2.69 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think attending lectures is more effi more effective than reading alone because everyone attend their (%hesitation%) lesson and so i have to do (%hesitation%) a lot
SI1267-01189-P50023 1 SI1267-01189 0.00 10.35 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it's very very important because (%hesitation%) all students (%hesitation%) waste the a lot of money to university
SI1267-01189-P50023 1 SI1267-01189 10.35 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> so (univers-) so university (%hesitation%) have the very good facilities to learn about anything
SI1267-01196-P40018 1 SI1267-01196 0.00 15.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so pollution is the main cause for the emission of acid particles through the smoke of factories
SI1267-01196-P40018 1 SI1267-01196 15.75 19.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by the winds
SI1267-01196-P40018 1 SI1267-01196 19.40 29.90 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some will fall as dust causing immediately damage to the environment while other acid particles get mixed with the cloud water
SI1267-01196-P40018 1 SI1267-01196 29.90 39.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these acid particles also get to the environment because they come coming into the earth in rain or snow
SI1267-01196-P40018 1 SI1267-01196 39.88 48.53 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these (%hesitation%) particles can cause not only di damage to the environment but also to the health of public

SI1267-01205-P30017 1 SI1267-01205 0.00 25.46 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion in this point (%hesitation%) one (%hesitation%) advantage (%hesitation%) for this situation (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) not all people (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) they can't pay the university
SI1267-01205-P30017 1 SI1267-01205 25.46 45.39 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the university in this country is very expensive and (%hesitation%) there are people it is necessary work in the same time (%hesitation%) he he's (%hesitation%) study

SI1267-01205-P50020 1 SI1267-01205 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> how i said previously for learning it's very important (%hesitation%) there there was exercise practic and face to face (%hesitation%) is

SI1267-01206-P10005 1 SI1267-01206 15.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but the changes we does we need to develop
SI1267-01206-P10006 1 SI1267-01206 0.00 6.40 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i do many things with my friends like playing soccers going to the park

SI1267-01206-P10006 1 SI1267-01206 11.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but the thing that we always do is playing soccer at at the football camp
SI1267-01206-P10007 1 SI1267-01206 0.00 11.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i would like to say that i am pretty similar with my brother because he is bigger than me and i have been looking everything that he does
SI1267-01206-P10007 1 SI1267-01206 11.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think that i am like him and i wanna be like him in the near future because he is very

SI1267-01206-P30017 1 SI1267-01206 10.02 15.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you will also feel like a relief of making some exercise
SI1267-01206-P30017 1 SI1267-01206 15.40 33.51 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but they have many disadvantages that someone can get injured or also that you will lose (%hesitation%) many time doing an exercise that the people don't like and this (c-) this will cause many problems
SI1267-01206-P30017 1 SI1267-01206 33.51 34.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> no
SI1267-01206-P30017 1 SI1267-01206 34.08 45.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my own opinion i think that they need to do a fitness classes but i think that not like an an hour of exercise
SI1267-01206-P30017 1 SI1267-01206 45.98 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that they (sh-) the best thing is to make (%hesitation%) twenty minutes of exercise like walk or run in around the school and this will help too much to the students
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 0.00 14.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> can see i will explain this diagram that consists on the information of how the honey goes from the the beehives to our to our home
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 14.59 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so the diagram names is honey from flower to shop
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 19.20 24.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so the first step is that the bees collect the nectar from the flowers
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 24.30 31.17 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they then they there go to the beehives and they make honey with this nectar
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 31.17 35.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 35.43 42.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) a manufacture process will put the honey into vases
SI1267-01206-P40018 1 SI1267-01206 42.97 52.11 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so then the truck can carry these vases to the different shops around the region or the country i don't know

SI127E-00039-P40018 1 SI127E-00039 21.31 27.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and after that (%hesitation%) the same bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00039-P40018 1 SI127E-00039 27.62 37.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) and then (%hesitation%) beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI127E-00039-P40018 1 SI127E-00039 37.57 46.21 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and when this is done (%hesitation%) honey is put on glass jars

SI127E-00161-P40018 1 SI127E-00161 30.51 32.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> its figures ramped up
SI127E-00161-P40018 1 SI127E-00161 32.16 41.53 <o,Q4,C,P4> now i think there was this was because of its i don't know (%hesitation%) popularity among (%hesitation%) teenagers or other people

SI127E-00282-P50020 1 SI127E-00282 16.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but (%hesitation%) paper is important
SI127E-00282-P50021 1 SI127E-00282 0.00 7.81 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think social media is not reliable more reliable than the newspaper

SI127E-00311-P10005 1 SI127E-00311 9.48 15.25 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in fact i say i stay four months in hawaii and new zealand
SI127E-00311-P10005 1 SI127E-00311 15.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> there was a very good experience for me

SI127E-00311-P10006 1 SI127E-00311 10.35 18.44 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i have been counting from seven to now
SI127E-00311-P10006 1 SI127E-00311 18.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i could
SI127E-00311-P10007 1 SI127E-00311 0.00 13.11 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think conversation with (na-) native is the best because that is the most practical and you can find out mistakes
SI127E-00311-P10007 1 SI127E-00311 13.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for example online english it's easy to get start
SI127E-00311-P10008 1 SI127E-00311 0.00 16.74 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i could learn new skill i want to i like to speak (f-) english fluently (s-) because i want to be a pilot

SI127E-00311-P30017 1 SI127E-00311 7.64 18.22 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and i believe that disadvantages are you cannot concentrate on your study
SI127E-00311-P30017 1 SI127E-00311 18.22 33.94 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i don't agree with that as my opinion because i think every college students should focus on your (s-) your studying
SI127E-00311-P30017 1 SI127E-00311 33.94 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i i shouldn't (univer-) all university student part of job while they are studying
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 0.00 9.28 <o,Q4,B1,P4> acid rain made from gas of vehicle and factories
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 9.28 20.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the gas raise raise to sky
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 20.34 28.18 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first acid particles are carried by wind
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 28.18 36.62 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so second other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 36.62 44.20 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally acid particles are in rain or snow
SI127E-00311-P40018 1 SI127E-00311 44.20 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so the gas damage to environment
SI127E-00311-P50019 1 SI127E-00311 0.00 19.38 <o,Q4,A2,P5> people usually buy meat (%hesitation%) for example beef or chicken but my opinion i think you you buy vegetables

SI127E-00311-P50021 1 SI127E-00311 5.83 16.86 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i recommend you can exercise twice a week
SI127E-00311-P50021 1 SI127E-00311 16.86 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> so you can
SI127E-00311-P50022 1 SI127E-00311 0.00 1.93 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think so too
SI127E-00311-P50022 1 SI127E-00311 1.93 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> so as far as possible you you sleep (%hesitation%) (fo-) for eight hours every day because sleep sleeping is

SI127E-00329-P10006 1 SI127E-00329 18.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> resting is the best thing
SI127E-00329-P10008 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 12.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's (%hesitation%) i think i will have an engine (%hesitation%) improvement in engines because i'm actually studying mechanical engineering
SI127E-00329-P10008 1 SI127E-00329 12.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i i think that's cool and that's very interesting to know about engines
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 16.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think that one of the advantages of having a job when you are studying is that you can get out when you finally have your degree and have some experience on the work field
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 16.99 31.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> also one of the disadvantages that i see is that some of my partners for example (%hesitation%) they don't care too much about their grades and they start to fail on their grades
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 31.23 33.77 <o,Q4,C,P3> that's the bad thing i see on that
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 33.77 52.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> and my opinion is that it's okay to have a job while you are studying but i think you rather have a job if you can do both if you can study and also if you can have a job (%hesitation%) and be responsible on both of them
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 52.14 55.59 <o,Q4,C,P3> that's my personal opinion
SI127E-00329-P30017 1 SI127E-00329 55.59 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> that will be all
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 12.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> the next i am going to talk about six the six steps you have to follow if you wanna travel by airplane
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 12.94 25.68 <o,Q4,C,P4> the first and most important i think is that you have to travel to the airport via bus subway or a taxi cab
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 25.68 36.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to check in all your stuff with someone who will later (%hesitation%) travel your stuff into the airplane
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 36.09 45.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to show all your documents to officers and show (%hesitation%) your backpacks in to security
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 45.95 48.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to wait a little bit
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 48.22 50.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then you will get a port
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 50.14 56.52 <o,Q4,C,P4> and in a few moments you the airplane will travel to your destination
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 56.52 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and that will be all travelling by airplane
SI127E-00329-P50019 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 16.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think nowadays the technology is used to navigate via (inter-) internet and and you can do it with your cell phone computer laptop all that stuff
SI127E-00329-P50019 1 SI127E-00329 16.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you can learn on it on videos
SI127E-00329-P50020 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 12.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think is always better to speak with someone face to face to know really about a topic because is not the same as you study at your own
SI127E-00329-P50020 1 SI127E-00329 12.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00329-P50021 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> working together i think is great is good because you have to be on the same page in order to work on the topic that you are studying
SI127E-00329-P50021 1 SI127E-00329 11.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think that will clear some doubts about the whole persons on the team by (b-)
SI127E-00329-P50022 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think is always better to be with a lot of people if you wanna (%hesitation%)
SI127E-00329-P50023 1 SI127E-00329 0.00 11.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think this is fundamental and essential in every university because if you don't improve your facilities the students (%hesitation%) won't improve
SI127E-00329-P50023 1 SI127E-00329 11.75 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i know this is weird but some some universities have to do this in order to succeed with your students
SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 0.00 4.52 <o,Q3,B1,P4> one of the first things you have to do when you want to
SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 4.52 10.13 <o,Q3,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) you have to go to the travel to the airport to the airport yeah
SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 10.13 15.18 <o,Q3,B1,P4> and then go to the airport check in to the (re-) registration
SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 15.18 21.16 <o,Q3,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) give to you document control ask for the document a control

SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 29.41 32.43 <o,Q3,B1,P4> and wait in the waiting room
SI127E-00380-P40018 1 SI127E-00380 32.43 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P4> then board the airplane and go to your destiny
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 0.00 4.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> all right guys welcome to this presentation on acid rain
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 4.30 18.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now the first thing i want to tell you is that some factories and all vehicles without any exceptions (%hesitation%) produce the so called (%hesitation%) exhaust fumes
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 18.97 31.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now those fumes (%hesitation%) turn into pollution which go which go into the air and i've heard that some of those particles are carried by wind and as you can see here in the graph it happens
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 31.56 32.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it does happen
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 32.97 36.55 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some of these particles fall as dust
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 36.55 50.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> nevertheless some of these produce clouds and when it rains it's what these clouds produce what (%hesitation%) hurts your your skin because that's called acid rain
SI127E-00402-P40018 1 SI127E-00402 50.33 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and if you don't if you're not careful with the amount of acid rain you are exposed to you can end up having a lot of skin problems
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 0.00 8.28 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you travel by airplane you you have some steps to have
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 8.28 18.40 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and first you you should travel to airport by airpl by car or train in some in some ways
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 18.40 35.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you should get on you should get on the airport about one hour early and then you should check in at the check in counter what you you use airline
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 35.00 37.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then document control centre
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 37.72 42.51 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you should go to document control centre and have security check
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 42.51 50.53 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you should wait for boarding time and finally boarding airport airplane
SI127E-00434-P40018 1 SI127E-00434 50.53 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is (%hesitation%) travelling by airplane
SI127E-00436-P10005 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 4.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite music is japanese rock
SI127E-00436-P10005 1 SI127E-00436 4.63 13.18 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i usually listen to j rock at home and the way to our company
SI127E-00436-P10005 1 SI127E-00436 13.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> every year i'm going to the (ja-) japanese rock festival in summer
SI127E-00436-P10006 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 6.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually enjoy travelling different places especially foreign countries
SI127E-00436-P10006 1 SI127E-00436 6.75 9.68 <o,Q4,B2,P1> every year i'm going foreign countries
SI127E-00436-P10006 1 SI127E-00436 9.68 14.71 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite place is west european countries

SI127E-00436-P10008 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 11.40 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in this global era the importance of speaking japanese no speaking english is very (i-) increasing rapidly
SI127E-00436-P10008 1 SI127E-00436 11.40 18.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i want to communicate with other countries' people in the future and work with (o-) international client
SI127E-00436-P10008 1 SI127E-00436 18.93 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it is very important
SI127E-00436-P30017 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 5.70 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) first of all learning foreign languages is very important
SI127E-00436-P30017 1 SI127E-00436 5.70 20.35 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantage of it is that you can communicate with more and more people and you can also learning the culture of it by learning different languages
SI127E-00436-P30017 1 SI127E-00436 20.35 34.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantage is that maybe the student (sh-) may (u-) waste the time of studying time because of not using foreign languages
SI127E-00436-P30017 1 SI127E-00436 34.61 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion almost all of students should study foreign language but some students for example who wants to be a researcher or so (%hesitation%) they don't have to study foreign language because they won't never use this language at all
SI127E-00436-P50019 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 5.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> using internet material is very good way for you
SI127E-00436-P50019 1 SI127E-00436 5.83 14.19 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can use b b c or new york times (on-) online by using your internet
SI127E-00436-P50019 1 SI127E-00436 14.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you have to use your internet to search your international latest news
SI127E-00436-P50020 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 2.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) somehow (%hesitation%) pretty sad
SI127E-00436-P50020 1 SI127E-00436 2.51 7.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in the future there is maybe no paper newspapers
SI127E-00436-P50020 1 SI127E-00436 7.38 12.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but in the future there a lot of online newspaper
SI127E-00436-P50020 1 SI127E-00436 12.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> by now we can use online newspapers so the majority is moving on
SI127E-00436-P50021 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 2.42 <o,Q5,B2,P5> definitely not
SI127E-00436-P50021 1 SI127E-00436 2.42 15.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to check what they are talking or of who they are talking carefully because there is no reliable source in social media
SI127E-00436-P50021 1 SI127E-00436 15.02 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to be too careful for using this information
SI127E-00436-P50022 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 9.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you are living in local area it is important because there is no local news information on tv or online
SI127E-00436-P50022 1 SI127E-00436 9.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if you are living in the centre of the nation you don't have to check because you can check on tv or international (n-)
SI127E-00436-P50023 1 SI127E-00436 0.00 14.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree this because for media it is useful for broadcasting bad news because most people can get impact of it
SI127E-00436-P50023 1 SI127E-00436 14.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and the media can earn about your attention

SI127E-00443-P30017 1 SI127E-00443 18.50 27.07 <o,Q5,C,P3> the most advantages can be that students learn how to manage their money and how to earn money
SI127E-00443-P30017 1 SI127E-00443 27.07 33.66 <o,Q5,C,P3> they learn that everything is not free and that they have to earn money
SI127E-00443-P30017 1 SI127E-00443 33.66 46.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> but disadvantages can be that (%hesitation%) this job may hurt their studying and they lost something to be good at their courses
SI127E-00443-P30017 1 SI127E-00443 46.47 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion it's essential for students to take a part (j-) part time job but it should be limited and (%hesitation%) in hours and some jobs

SI127E-00443-P40018 1 SI127E-00443 11.39 16.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at first the factories and vehicles make some pollutions

SI127E-00443-P40018 1 SI127E-00443 25.71 30.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then two ways maybe happen to these particles
SI127E-00443-P40018 1 SI127E-00443 30.81 44.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> perhaps they fall as dust fall to the ground or they combine with the cloud with the cloud water and finally rain or snow
SI127E-00443-P40018 1 SI127E-00443 44.70 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you know it they hurt the environment so

SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 0.00 13.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> the notion that all students should study at last one foreign language in order to pass their university course there are some advantages and disadvantages
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 13.00 29.69 <o,Q5,C,P3> that clearly an advantage is that (%hesitation%) students (%hesitation%) speaking a foreign language very well (%hesitation%) will (%hesitation%) really good for the for their for their find a job after they graduated from the university
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 29.69 41.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) students should spend a lot of time to learn that foreign language but even though they can't use in the future
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 41.95 44.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> that's definitely wasting their time
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 44.41 52.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my perspective i think (%hesitation%) (s-) it is necessary that students have to learn some foreign language
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 52.37 57.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> that means they have more opportunities in the future
SI127E-00446-P30017 1 SI127E-00446 57.31 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> it's good for their mind
SI127E-00446-P50019 1 SI127E-00446 0.00 12.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> the best method to send the international news to students is using their (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) laptops or their smartphone to know that news
SI127E-00446-P50019 1 SI127E-00446 12.71 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> because (%hesitation%) it's really convenient if they use some electricity equipment
SI127E-00446-P50020 1 SI127E-00446 0.00 14.72 <o,Q4,C,P5> i totally agree about that (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) i think newspaper is not (%hesitation%) friendly to the environment because newspaper needs use the (%hesitation%) paper that (%hesitation%) made of the wooden
SI127E-00446-P50020 1 SI127E-00446 14.72 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) and the some electricity equipment can instead of
SI127E-00446-P50021 1 SI127E-00446 0.00 7.62 <o,Q5,C,P5> my perspective i don't believe all of social media's news are reliable
SI127E-00446-P50021 1 SI127E-00446 7.62 15.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) everyone can send the news to the (s-) social media for eli for example like facebook
SI127E-00446-P50021 1 SI127E-00446 15.94 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) then nobody knows (%hesitation%) if some is

SI127E-00446-P50022 1 SI127E-00446 16.68 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's really important to
SI127E-00446-P50023 1 SI127E-00446 0.00 16.70 <o,Q5,C,P5> i can't agree that idea (%hesitation%) because i think news is just the news and there's no bad news and good news because for some the same news for different people they may think that (%hesitation%) it's different
SI127E-00446-P50023 1 SI127E-00446 16.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> some people believe that news is bad some people

SI127E-00447-P40018 1 SI127E-00447 23.37 41.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and later you when you pass these control you (mu-) you have to wait in the waste wait room because in this site you (%hesitation%) you you are a lot of time

SI127E-00448-P10007 1 SI127E-00448 14.93 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think it's really important to practice too

SI127E-00448-P30017 1 SI127E-00448 18.85 34.21 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but one of advantage of this is that the student will obtain a lot of experience of how the work working work in the real life
SI127E-00448-P30017 1 SI127E-00448 34.21 46.34 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and one disadvantage is that the student won't have (%hesitation%) much time to do activities like (%hesitation%) bel playing videogames or work out

SI127E-00508-P50021 1 SI127E-00508 11.91 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if you want to do any sport or (com-) (%hesitation%) compete in some competition it's better if you train every (da-)
SI127E-00508-P50022 1 SI127E-00508 0.00 17.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you can do it it's the best way to get a healthy living life because it's very important to the body to rest about all the moments in your day
SI127E-00508-P50022 1 SI127E-00508 17.08 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's very important to sleep (ei-)
SI127E-00508-P50023 1 SI127E-00508 0.00 4.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it could affect in both parts
SI127E-00508-P50023 1 SI127E-00508 4.35 14.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) first (%hesitation%) positive you can do a lot of thing with a (%hesitation%) many afford with technology
SI127E-00508-P50023 1 SI127E-00508 14.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but a disadvantage could be that you can you cannot do
SI127E-00513-P10005 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 1.99 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am quite interested
SI127E-00513-P10005 1 SI127E-00513 1.99 6.02 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in fact my son (%hesitation%) is a musician
SI127E-00513-P10005 1 SI127E-00513 6.02 8.47 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it's quite important for me
SI127E-00513-P10005 1 SI127E-00513 8.47 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's something personal
SI127E-00513-P10006 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 14.33 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to enjoy it very much but (%hesitation%) during some years i had to travel (%hesitation%) abroad (%hesitation%) every week almost every week and (%hesitation%) i fed up at the end i fed up with it
SI127E-00513-P10006 1 SI127E-00513 14.33 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> now (%hesitation%) i'm getting used of or again to to to (trave-)

SI127E-00513-P10007 1 SI127E-00513 7.75 11.54 <o,Q5,B2,P1> he is one of the most important minds in the world
SI127E-00513-P10007 1 SI127E-00513 11.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> he has been the the most important physician in twentieth century and maybe the the most important
SI127E-00513-P10008 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 9.39 <o,Q5,B2,P1> speaking english (%hesitation%) will not help me only (%hesitation%) in my job but also when i am travelling abroad
SI127E-00513-P10008 1 SI127E-00513 9.39 15.20 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's (%hesitation%) just mandatory to speak english when you are (%hesitation%) around the world
SI127E-00513-P10008 1 SI127E-00513 15.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> otherwise you cannot get through
SI127E-00513-P30017 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 23.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main advantages of learning and study studying a different language when you are studying at university are related with the (%hesitation%) open the doors that are open to you (%hesitation%) to when when you know another language
SI127E-00513-P30017 1 SI127E-00513 23.15 33.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> i mean when you learn another language you can go abroad to work to investigate to go further with your studies
SI127E-00513-P30017 1 SI127E-00513 33.48 50.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main disadvantage is that they take a lot of times time from your from your main subjects but at the end of the day the advantages (%hesitation%) surpass the disadvantages
SI127E-00513-P30017 1 SI127E-00513 50.50 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and and what
SI127E-00513-P50019 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 14.31 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the best way is to to go to reputed (%hesitation%) newspapers because (%hesitation%) if you go to internet (%hesitation%) you can find many (%hesitation%) fake news
SI127E-00513-P50019 1 SI127E-00513 14.31 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you are not (%hesitation%) you are not introducing that culture
SI127E-00513-P50020 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> no i don't because nowadays there are so many information that we all need (%hesitation%) someone some professional to (%hesitation%) filter filter all the information and give us (%hesitation%) it in in a more digestive way
SI127E-00513-P50021 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 6.65 <o,Q5,C,P5> sometimes it is because you can (%hesitation%) get the information from first hand
SI127E-00513-P50021 1 SI127E-00513 6.65 14.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> when but (%hesitation%) the problem is that there is there are so many (%hesitation%) things in social media
SI127E-00513-P50021 1 SI127E-00513 14.84 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> there are so (ma-) (m-) (m-) so much information that you cannot trust
SI127E-00513-P50022 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 14.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> although is important to know news of the world (%hesitation%) having (%hesitation%) knowing about local news it's really important because you are living here and in a in a place
SI127E-00513-P50022 1 SI127E-00513 14.68 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you have to be (%hesitation%) you have to know what it's going on in your
SI127E-00513-P50023 1 SI127E-00513 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i quite agree agree with that because (%hesitation%) bad bad news are (%hesitation%) better to spread (%hesitation%)
SI127E-00515-P10005 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 2.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> of course i can
SI127E-00515-P10005 1 SI127E-00515 2.36 4.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i live in valencia
SI127E-00515-P10005 1 SI127E-00515 4.96 11.55 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i live in a neighbourhood quite quite steady
SI127E-00515-P10005 1 SI127E-00515 11.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we are not loudy and we just enjoy going to the bar and take some coffee
SI127E-00515-P10006 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 7.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i am on holiday what i enjoy most is to spend a wonderful day with my girlfriend
SI127E-00515-P10006 1 SI127E-00515 7.90 12.47 <o,Q4,B2,P1> just so you know she's the girl of my life
SI127E-00515-P10006 1 SI127E-00515 12.47 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> she's the love of my life
SI127E-00515-P10006 1 SI127E-00515 13.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) just being with her is enough to have a good day
SI127E-00515-P10007 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 1.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's a tough question
SI127E-00515-P10007 1 SI127E-00515 1.84 7.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but if i have to choose one i think i would choose my father
SI127E-00515-P10007 1 SI127E-00515 7.23 10.35 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (s-) he's the leader
SI127E-00515-P10007 1 SI127E-00515 10.35 12.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> he's my teacher
SI127E-00515-P10007 1 SI127E-00515 12.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> he's also my tutor (%hesitation%) of life and i will love him forever
SI127E-00515-P10008 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 7.68 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in the future i would like to work in a financial company
SI127E-00515-P10008 1 SI127E-00515 7.68 11.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have always loved the numbers
SI127E-00515-P10008 1 SI127E-00515 11.04 14.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i feel comfortable with them
SI127E-00515-P10008 1 SI127E-00515 14.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think i am able to work with them for my life
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 1.96 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello maria
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 1.96 5.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i just received your message about how to arrive to the airport
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 5.91 7.26 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's quite simple
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 7.26 14.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you just have to go by bus or by taxi or even by train to the airport
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 14.54 19.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all when you arrive there you have to do the check in
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 19.06 24.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that a policeman will make you the document control
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 24.63 46.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> right after that the security will search your baggage in order to look for some recipients that could be (%hesitation%) danger (%hesitation%) danger for your for your colleagues in the in the plane
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 46.97 49.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that you will wait in the restaurant
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 49.71 53.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you will go board the the plane
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 53.23 55.53 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you will land off
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 55.53 57.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that will be amazing
SI127E-00515-P40018 1 SI127E-00515 57.25 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i hope you enjoy your flight
SI127E-00515-P50019 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 2.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's a good question
SI127E-00515-P50019 1 SI127E-00515 2.69 6.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't even think that the experts know the answer
SI127E-00515-P50019 1 SI127E-00515 6.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i guess technology is a tool that you can use in order to enhance or boost your studying level
SI127E-00515-P50020 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 13.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> without a doubt face to face will be is and it was the best way to learn or practice especially for languages
SI127E-00515-P50020 1 SI127E-00515 13.36 18.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example english it's impossible to learn just to facing a computer
SI127E-00515-P50020 1 SI127E-00515 18.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you need face to face
SI127E-00515-P50021 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 5.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to be fair i don't really know because i'm not an expert of the subject
SI127E-00515-P50021 1 SI127E-00515 5.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i would say that group projects are the best way to learn because of the emphasis you made with your partners and their learning they give to you and you to them
SI127E-00515-P50022 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 4.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i reckon that attending lectures will be always better
SI127E-00515-P50022 1 SI127E-00515 4.83 17.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for instance when i was in my university degree (u-) it was impossible for me to learn if i went just by myself
SI127E-00515-P50022 1 SI127E-00515 17.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i need partner
SI127E-00515-P50023 1 SI127E-00515 0.00 4.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think it is so important for average students
SI127E-00515-P50023 1 SI127E-00515 4.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i do think that learning facilities are so important for the people that need help such for like for example people who has disabilities
SI127E-00525-P40018 1 SI127E-00525 0.00 11.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> below is a diagram of how honey is produced and everything everything starts in nature with a bee and a flower
SI127E-00525-P40018 1 SI127E-00525 11.39 16.45 <o,Q4,B1,P4> bees collect nectar from (flow-) flowers and bring this the beehives
SI127E-00525-P40018 1 SI127E-00525 16.45 24.78 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the beehive the nectar is is extracted and it makes it that turns the honey possible
SI127E-00525-P40018 1 SI127E-00525 24.78 43.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well once the ti honey is made and collected from the nectar the beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and put in a jar preferably in a glass jar to keep save the flavor color of the honey
SI127E-00525-P40018 1 SI127E-00525 43.06 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> once this is in the jar you have to transport to supermarket and in the supermarket this will be put in a shelf and kept where consumers can buy and enjoy it
SI127E-00531-P10005 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 5.57 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm very interested into environment as i'm kind of outdoorsy youngster
SI127E-00531-P10005 1 SI127E-00531 5.57 13.34 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love to be walking in a nature in wildlife in forested to meet some animals while i am trekking or running or cycling
SI127E-00531-P10005 1 SI127E-00531 13.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think that we must be careful about environment because if we are keep on keeping on pollution polluting so much
SI127E-00531-P10006 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 5.91 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) me and my friends we enjoy playing video games or practising sport with some of them
SI127E-00531-P10006 1 SI127E-00531 5.91 10.84 <o,Q5,C,P1> i we always fancy a good game of football basketball or we like to play tennis
SI127E-00531-P10006 1 SI127E-00531 10.84 19.37 <o,Q5,C,P1> we also we also crazy about hiking in mountains as we are together loving (%hesitation%) wildlife and nature
SI127E-00531-P10006 1 SI127E-00531 19.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so
SI127E-00531-P10007 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 4.13 <o,Q4,C,P1> in my family i think that i is most similar to my brother
SI127E-00531-P10007 1 SI127E-00531 4.13 13.92 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) every people i meet or we meet say that we are really (%hesitation%) looking alike each other (%hesitation%) physically but also in our behaviours
SI127E-00531-P10007 1 SI127E-00531 13.92 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) both (%hesitation%) like sports watching some football on tv playing video game (beca-)
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 3.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would like to live in the mountains of south america
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 3.97 6.65 <o,Q4,C,P1> first i wanna would like to live in the mountains because i love it
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 6.65 8.94 <o,Q4,C,P1> i love to be running or cycling in it
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 8.94 10.52 <o,Q4,C,P1> i love to be outside
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 10.52 12.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i'm an outdoorsy youngster
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 12.00 16.65 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i would like (%hesitation%) to be in (%hesitation%) south america because all my family live there
SI127E-00531-P10008 1 SI127E-00531 16.65 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i would like to travel there with (%hesitation%) discover new culture
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 10.09 <o,Q4,C,P3> i'm gonna speak about is the one that implies that schools should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 10.09 23.26 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my point of view the advantages of fitness classes are that it allows every student to remain fit and (%hesitation%) to keep (%hesitation%) well in their their head
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 23.26 30.83 <o,Q4,C,P3> whereas the (d-) (d-) drawbacks of these measures are that some people really don't like sports
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 30.83 43.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) i think it's not necessary to force them to do so because if you (f-) them to do so they will feel like they they like it even less if they did it on their on their own
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 43.56 51.77 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion we should not (%hesitation%) force people to do (spor-) (%hesitation%) sports (%hesitation%) activities physical activities
SI127E-00531-P30017 1 SI127E-00531 51.77 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> it must remain a pleasure so you have to do it willingly and not (%hesitation%) under the submission
SI127E-00531-P50019 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 7.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> first of all students (%hesitation%) should (%hesitation%) consider the situation of the country they want to study in
SI127E-00531-P50019 1 SI127E-00531 7.96 13.32 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) they have to be careful that there's no war or crisis in the country they chose
SI127E-00531-P50019 1 SI127E-00531 13.32 18.45 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) they also have to be careful about the language that it is being talked in this country
SI127E-00531-P50019 1 SI127E-00531 18.45 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example if you want to study
SI127E-00531-P50020 1 SI127E-00531 0.00 9.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> the way i see it studying in a second language (%hesitation%) allows to improve and to became become fluent in your english
SI127E-00531-P50020 1 SI127E-00531 9.96 17.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example if your second language you choose english (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) it's really useful for your daily life

SI127E-00534-P40018 1 SI127E-00534 48.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it's important to buy me (%hesitation%) honey from local markets because they create and they create it in a more sustainable way

SI127E-00535-P10007 1 SI127E-00535 13.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and yes i think it the best way is to speak with other natives
SI127E-00535-P10008 1 SI127E-00535 0.00 4.18 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think going to a calisthenic park for some months

SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 9.20 13.67 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think this can have more disadvantages than advantages
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 13.67 15.29 <o,Q4,C,P3> but i'm going to talk about this
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 15.29 21.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> some advantages can be that the student gets money and it learns to be independent from their parents
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 21.88 30.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> and other advantages is that the student has this time to use your phone and do activities that don't serve for anything
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 30.21 34.20 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but it it it also has a lot of disadvantages
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 34.20 43.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> for example during exam time you (h-) you may have less time to study or you may not have time to hang out with friends
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 43.25 50.48 <o,Q4,C,P3> so my opinion about this is that for example i agree that taking a part job can be useful in summer
SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 50.48 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but during the year i think this isn't very good

SI127E-00535-P50019 1 SI127E-00535 0.00 12.13 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think a good way to develop good eating habits is for example at the start of the week setting out a menu which has lots of healthy food and also the food you like
SI127E-00535-P50019 1 SI127E-00535 12.13 14.23 <o,Q4,C,P5> and during the week follow this menu
SI127E-00535-P50019 1 SI127E-00535 14.23 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's very important not to forbidden any food as this can be bad

SI127E-00535-P50020 1 SI127E-00535 14.69 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so yes i think it's very important to drink the right amount of water

SI127E-00550-P10006 1 SI127E-00550 8.90 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but well being more realistic i will travel to switzerland or london and i will conform with this

SI127E-00550-P10008 1 SI127E-00550 3.42 8.38 <o,Q5,B2,P1> probably i will find a job easier
SI127E-00550-P10008 1 SI127E-00550 8.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and if i go to another countries it will help for me to communicate with other people
SI127E-00550-P30017 1 SI127E-00550 0.00 29.59 <o,Q5,B1,P3> from my point of view i think that one of the principal advantage is that students can learn other language to travel to another countries or simply (%hesitation%) to find a job easer because it's very valuated
SI127E-00550-P30017 1 SI127E-00550 29.59 52.93 <o,Q5,B1,P3> on the other hand i think that one of the principal disadvantage is that science students (%hesitation%) if they aren't so good with language they will probably have more problems than other other people
SI127E-00550-P30017 1 SI127E-00550 52.93 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion i think it depends of the person and well i think it's positive
SI127E-00550-P50019 1 SI127E-00550 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well i think that (w-) one of the best ways to find information is to search in to search it in internet because probably you will find the information that you expect
SI127E-00550-P50020 1 SI127E-00550 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes of course i completely agree with the idea because i think newspapers (%hesitation%) are a lot of a little bit old fashioned and it will be replaced with new technologies
SI127E-00550-P50021 1 SI127E-00550 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> no it isn't because there are so many fake news and it's important to to find out information reliable and in social media it's impossible
SI127E-00550-P50022 1 SI127E-00550 0.00 3.17 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well it's not very important to me
SI127E-00550-P50022 1 SI127E-00550 3.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> if it wasn't so many of other news i think i will (%hesitation%) see more the the news but it isn't

SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 0.00 7.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> this diagram illustrate the stages involve in the making of the honey
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 7.22 14.77 <o,Q4,C,P4> it all started with the nectar being collected by bees from the flowers
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 14.77 26.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> that nectar is taken to the beehives where it will be made as a honey of course by the bees again
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 26.00 37.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> that honey will be collected once it is made will be collected by the keeper beekeepers from all those beehives
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 37.08 47.06 <o,Q4,C,P4> and that honey will be contained into several jars in order to commercialize the product
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 47.06 53.87 <o,Q4,C,P4> it will be transported to the shop where it will have a correct exposure
SI127E-00552-P40018 1 SI127E-00552 53.87 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> overall we can see how the bee is quite essential for the making

SI127E-00567-P10005 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my interest is absolute because learning about other people lives and cultures gives you a new perspective of how diversity human societies are

SI127E-00567-P10007 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 9.07 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would rather consider that (ev-) every option and every way is (nec-) is needed
SI127E-00567-P10007 1 SI127E-00567 9.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) for instance writing listening speaking and reading all of them (%hesitation%) compliment your studying of the english

SI127E-00567-P40018 1 SI127E-00567 2.00 11.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> we're here today to talk about the formation of acid rain and its impact on nature and on human bodies
SI127E-00567-P40018 1 SI127E-00567 11.73 31.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so at the beginning (%hesitation%) factories and vehicles and or modern way of of moving and producing livelihoods it (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) creates pollution that (%hesitation%) arise in the air
SI127E-00567-P40018 1 SI127E-00567 31.70 48.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the wind is carrying this this (part-) (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) this little particles and then mix it with (%hesitation%) water
SI127E-00567-P40018 1 SI127E-00567 48.16 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally the rain absorb this pollution and go to the crops that
SI127E-00567-P50020 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 9.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is absolutely fundamental because (%hesitation%) human beings are from of ninety percent of water
SI127E-00567-P50020 1 SI127E-00567 9.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we need at least i think two liters of water per day but this includes fruits and vegetables
SI127E-00567-P50021 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 14.22 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you must be fit in order to avoid (%hesitation%) future have problems but it doesn't mean you have to be every day on the gym (%hesitation%) every afternoon
SI127E-00567-P50021 1 SI127E-00567 14.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is it simple as going for a walk or riding a bicycle
SI127E-00567-P50022 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 12.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that is the average of (%hesitation%) sleeping hours but depending of the person you would need five hours and or nine
SI127E-00567-P50022 1 SI127E-00567 12.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think it relates to the your state or your life (experien-)
SI127E-00567-P50023 1 SI127E-00567 0.00 13.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> where if (loo-) if we look deeply into life it depends of what use of technology or other stuff (%hesitation%) you have
SI127E-00567-P50023 1 SI127E-00567 13.06 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it can be either positive or negative depending of the control you have on
SI127E-00573-P40018 1 SI127E-00573 0.00 18.20 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about the production of the honey that is not only beneficial for us it also beneficial the plants because it starts (%hesitation%) with the bees in the flowers
SI127E-00573-P40018 1 SI127E-00573 18.20 24.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> that is the only way that flowers can expand their (%hesitation%) pollation
SI127E-00573-P40018 1 SI127E-00573 24.12 46.43 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) the bees go to their beehives that is like their homes and (%hesitation%) (accu-) amount the nectar that the sugars that have collected from the flowers to give (%hesitation%) something to eat to the little bees
SI127E-00573-P40018 1 SI127E-00573 46.43 53.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the beekeepers collect it and put it in some kind of glasses
SI127E-00573-P40018 1 SI127E-00573 53.41 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the honey is transport to the supermarket when you can enjoy it
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 0.00 7.69 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you go to travel by plane (%hesitation%) you have go to the airport
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 7.69 11.09 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can go by car bus or train
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 11.09 21.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you have to (%hesitation%) look (%hesitation%) take off area (%hesitation%) that you have to check in and give you suitcase
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 21.70 28.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to show you document and pass the security control
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 28.33 37.39 <o,Q4,B2,P4> until the plane (lev-) (%hesitation%) leaves you can wait in a area with shop and different restaurant
SI127E-00583-P40018 1 SI127E-00583 37.39 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when is time to go out you just have to ride the the plane
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 0.00 4.11 <o,Q4,C,P4> our teachers now welcome to this presentation on acid rain
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 4.11 13.64 <o,Q4,C,P4> now (%hesitation%) i think everybody knows that factories and vehicles produce pollution but did you know that this pollution then turns into smoke
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 13.64 17.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then this smoke turns into the acid particles
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 17.94 19.71 <o,Q4,C,P4> and two things could happened
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 19.71 23.99 <o,Q4,C,P4> the first one is that some of these acid particles could fall as dust
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 23.99 31.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> (hi-) (%hesitation%) however (%hesitation%) when it comes to cloud water is when things (%hesitation%) could get let's say a bit worse
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 31.94 49.41 <o,Q4,C,P4> because when this acid particles mix with cloud water (%hesitation%) and when you rains is what these rain (con-) is what these rain contains that can cause some sort of skin rash in the skin or what's even worse it can damage the environment which is the topic of my presentation today
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 49.41 58.67 <o,Q4,C,P4> and now (%hesitation%) i would like to run through and i'll be saying your name and i want you to say present or i'm here or (%hesitation%) how
SI127E-00584-P40018 1 SI127E-00584 58.67 60.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> you you can
SI127E-00586-P40018 1 SI127E-00586 0.00 13.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well i'm going to show a presentation by slide (%hesitation%) where i i can can see the the (%hesitation%) acid acid rain effect
SI127E-00586-P40018 1 SI127E-00586 13.96 26.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first the factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) have pollution and (%hesitation%) it's (%hesitation%) rise to the atmosphere
SI127E-00586-P40018 1 SI127E-00586 26.98 38.21 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) these particles (%hesitation%) these particles (%hesitation%) are mixed with with the clouds
SI127E-00586-P40018 1 SI127E-00586 38.21 57.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally (%hesitation%) the the particles (%hesitation%) fall fall down (%hesitation%) through the rain to the forest to the lake and finally they produce a damage to the environment
SI127E-00586-P40018 1 SI127E-00586 57.30 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so (%hesitation%)
SI127E-00589-P40018 1 SI127E-00589 0.00 6.66 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i'm going to talk about how travelling by airplane
SI127E-00589-P40018 1 SI127E-00589 6.66 21.81 <o,Q4,B1,P4> to arrive to the airport you can by bus or metro or car
SI127E-00589-P40018 1 SI127E-00589 21.81 37.77 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then in the airport you must pass check in and document control in security control
SI127E-00589-P40018 1 SI127E-00589 37.77 49.60 <o,Q4,B1,P4> security control will watch your suitcase
SI127E-00589-P40018 1 SI127E-00589 49.60 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you wait to board in a plane
SI127E-00597-P10005 1 SI127E-00597 0.00 13.69 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love music a lot of kind of music but (%hesitation%) when i was little i tried to learn how to play piano but i couldn't because i don't have any rhythm

SI127E-00597-P30017 1 SI127E-00597 0.00 9.54 <o,Q4,C,P3> some people think that to pass university course (%hesitation%) university students should study a foreign language

SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 1.90 3.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 3.33 12.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and today i'm going to talk about travelling by airplanes based in this imagine
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 12.33 20.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) so first (%hesitation%) you need travel to airport maybe in vehicle or train or bus
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 20.20 28.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and in the airport you need go to check in and check your tickets
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 28.41 35.61 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you following (docu-) document control and you need show your passport

SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 45.84 51.96 <o,Q4,B2,P4> maybe go to the bathroom or drink some coffee or whatever
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 51.96 55.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally you aboard and fly
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 55.56 56.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> thank you
SI127E-00628-P40018 1 SI127E-00628 56.25 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that's it
SI127E-00630-P10005 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am really interested in environment because i think that this is a nowaday topic and it is really important in nowaday society
SI127E-00630-P10006 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my friends and me enjoying doing together different things specially going going to the library and going to a park and drinking some beers (%hesitation%) some cup of coffee
SI127E-00630-P10007 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 8.54 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am pretty similar to my daughter but she is thirteen a year and i am an adult
SI127E-00630-P10007 1 SI127E-00630 8.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so we have similarities and differences
SI127E-00630-P10008 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like i would like to live in the future in canada because i think that this is an interesting place to find the job of my future my dream job
SI127E-00630-P30017 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 10.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) some schools and college (%hesitation%) should make time for the school days and for the students to do fitness classes
SI127E-00630-P30017 1 SI127E-00630 10.61 27.66 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the one hand i think that it is a great advantage for the students to have free time doing some type of sport because this is a way to support a healthy lifestyle in addition to healthy eating habits
SI127E-00630-P30017 1 SI127E-00630 27.66 40.86 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand if they spend too much time doing doing sport they will have less time to prepare their classes and to study for their exams
SI127E-00630-P30017 1 SI127E-00630 40.86 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think that in my opinion (%hesitation%) we will find we should find a a balance between doing some some sport and studying for the exams
SI127E-00630-P50019 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 13.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that most students consider the country where they are going to live and study in relation to the possibilities to find a job there
SI127E-00630-P50019 1 SI127E-00630 13.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and to learn the the language of the country in which
SI127E-00630-P50020 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 9.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the beneficial effects of studying in a second language is that you can improve your fluency in this language
SI127E-00630-P50020 1 SI127E-00630 9.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you can acquire the knowledge about the culture and different attitudes and behaviors of this foreign country in relation to the
SI127E-00630-P50021 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 14.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to start with students will find difficult to live without their family and to adapt themselves to a different weather and eating habits
SI127E-00630-P50021 1 SI127E-00630 14.19 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think that it's a great opportunity for them to improve their
SI127E-00630-P50022 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can learn about the local culture when studying in a foreign country initially living within a family and they can relate and they can get the knowledge of the local culture sharing different standpoints with a family member
SI127E-00630-P50023 1 SI127E-00630 0.00 18.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i (se-) as i see it and if you ask my opinion i honestly must established that this is a convenient and great idea because it is no doubt that the students become independent when they are not living with the parents
SI127E-00630-P50023 1 SI127E-00630 18.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 0.00 4.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> ok let's talk about how to make acid rain
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 4.00 8.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all all vehicles and factories make air pollution
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 8.59 13.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the air pollution there is a lot of acid particles in smoke
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 13.88 19.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this particle is (%hesitation%) a very tiny piece of acid
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 19.70 30.11 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this (%hesitation%) acid rain were carried by wind and some particles fall as dust and make some damage to the environment
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 30.11 39.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the other acid particles mix are mixed with cloud water and cloud makes rain or snow
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 39.42 48.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the this rain or snow were mixed by tiny piece of acid this is a acid particle
SI127E-00644-P40018 1 SI127E-00644 48.98 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and if the cloud makes rain or snow the rain or snow will attach to earth and damage make some damage to the
SI127E-00645-P40018 1 SI127E-00645 0.00 8.13 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) ok (%hesitation%) i'm going to explain who to collect honey
SI127E-00645-P40018 1 SI127E-00645 8.13 29.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) (fi-) first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and then (%hesitation%) bees (%hesitation%) make honey from from nectar in their beehive (%hesitation%) and spend time in there here
SI127E-00645-P40018 1 SI127E-00645 29.79 42.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then (beek-) (bee-) beekeepers collect honey from beehives and (sen-) send it (%hesitation%) a fabric
SI127E-00645-P40018 1 SI127E-00645 42.67 48.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the fabric tranpors transport this (%hesitation%) to a supermarket

SI127E-00647-P10005 1 SI127E-00647 11.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i can enjoy the shopping or some activities
SI127E-00647-P10006 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 3.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in holiday i enjoy the travelling
SI127E-00647-P10006 1 SI127E-00647 3.94 8.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy travelling with my friend
SI127E-00647-P10006 1 SI127E-00647 8.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i enjoy the local food and beautiful scene and talking with the people who live in local city
SI127E-00647-P10007 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 7.46 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy with my sister big sister because i live with her
SI127E-00647-P10007 1 SI127E-00647 7.46 16.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and every weekend i we will go to shopping or enjoy some activities
SI127E-00647-P10007 1 SI127E-00647 16.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we have a good relationship
SI127E-00647-P10008 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 4.97 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my job i want to be a pilot
SI127E-00647-P10008 1 SI127E-00647 4.97 8.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> because i have longing for pilot for long time
SI127E-00647-P10008 1 SI127E-00647 8.43 14.05 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so my first flight experience made me want to be a pilot
SI127E-00647-P10008 1 SI127E-00647 14.05 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 8.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantage point is that they can get a chance to get job and money their own money
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 8.23 17.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> this is very important because most of university student don't manage their pay for their university studies
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 17.98 20.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> so this is very important
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 20.22 30.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand disadvantage is that it takes a lot of time and energy to get job to pay for their university students
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 30.52 38.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my opinion all university student need not to get a job to pay for their university studies
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 38.23 45.77 <o,Q5,C,P3> because yeah in there it have advantage point but it takes a lot of time
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 45.77 51.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> so moreover for university student the most important things is just studying
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 51.16 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so all university student need not to get a job to pay for their university studies
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 7.60 <o,Q5,B2,P4> okay i would like to talk about explain what you need to do travelling by airplane
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 7.60 9.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> there are six steps
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 9.33 15.01 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at first you go to airport by car or train
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 15.01 19.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you have to check in
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 19.09 23.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you go to passport control
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 23.07 28.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and third they have to through the security
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 28.81 41.76 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then five you can wait and at there you can go to restaurant or take coffee or go to toilet
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 41.76 46.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then finally you board that airport airline
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 46.30 48.08 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 48.08 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this is a this is that what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI127E-00647-P50019 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 4.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can use a i learning
SI127E-00647-P50019 1 SI127E-00647 4.30 14.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) by using a i learning they can learn by a i and they can get feedbacks
SI127E-00647-P50019 1 SI127E-00647 14.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it very effective to learn learning
SI127E-00647-P50020 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 4.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i completely the same opinion
SI127E-00647-P50020 1 SI127E-00647 4.48 6.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i'm very
SI127E-00647-P50020 1 SI127E-00647 6.23 9.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i am agree with this idea
SI127E-00647-P50020 1 SI127E-00647 9.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> face to face is very important because you can get in feedback and you can improve your studying or learning
SI127E-00647-P50021 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 9.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> by group projects you can improve communication skill because in group project you have to tell something with your partners
SI127E-00647-P50021 1 SI127E-00647 9.89 12.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you can get a communication skill
SI127E-00647-P50021 1 SI127E-00647 12.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is very important because communication skill is used every day
SI127E-00647-P50022 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion attending lecture is more effective than reading alone because attend by attending lecture you can get (%hesitation%) feedback from another people or something like teacher and this is very effective to learn or study
SI127E-00647-P50023 1 SI127E-00647 0.00 15.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> modern learning facility is very important for university because (%hesitation%) society is changing all over the all time so modern learning facility improve every day
SI127E-00647-P50023 1 SI127E-00647 15.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it is very effective to learn or study
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 0.00 1.94 <o,Q5,C,P4> hey how are you doing
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 1.94 9.47 <o,Q5,C,P4> well here we have three different three different pop music sites what you can use on the internet
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 9.47 12.43 <o,Q5,C,P4> here we have tunes net music now and sing for you
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 12.43 20.40 <o,Q5,C,P4> i've been looking for a graph and this graph is seven days and talk about the thousand of people who listen to these sites
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 20.40 25.96 <o,Q5,C,P4> and i have to say for example for tunes net has been doing an (in-) huge increase
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 25.96 34.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> they starting twenty and now are in one in a hundred thousand people listen to the site so it's very good point
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 34.14 44.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> music now starting (eight-) below eighty and ends in eighty so just a small increase (%hesitation%) and song for you is the biggest failure for these (%hesitation%) three
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 44.77 48.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> they starting sixty and they have end even below twenty
SI127E-00648-P40018 1 SI127E-00648 48.95 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so have to if i have if i have to choose one i only can say that the best one is obviously tunes net because it's the most reliable
SI127E-00652-P40018 1 SI127E-00652 0.00 32.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> how we can see the site songs for you shows an average of about around sixty thousands of visits until the five day when his visits or they visits goes down to (twe-) to twenty visits thousands of visits
SI127E-00652-P40018 1 SI127E-00652 32.44 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the other hand tunes net shows an important increasement from twenty or from average of twenty visits twenty thousand of visits and at the fifth day it shows an important an (ama-) an amazing growing up
SI127E-00653-P10005 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 6.19 <o,Q4,C,P1> yeah (%hesitation%) i'm living now in the u k at london more precise at battersea
SI127E-00653-P10005 1 SI127E-00653 6.19 8.94 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's a beautiful place quiet place
SI127E-00653-P10005 1 SI127E-00653 8.94 11.55 <o,Q4,C,P1> there is a lot of parks also
SI127E-00653-P10005 1 SI127E-00653 11.55 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> there is big parks and also lots of (sho-) shopping around which is a really good thing
SI127E-00653-P10006 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 8.50 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) when i am in holiday i enjoy (%hesitation%) going to the park doing some activities such as running or having a walk
SI127E-00653-P10006 1 SI127E-00653 8.50 13.60 <o,Q4,C,P1> i like to do sports a lot because during the week i don't have time coz i'm still studying
SI127E-00653-P10006 1 SI127E-00653 13.60 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i don't have time to practice sports so i like to practice sports a lot in the holiday
SI127E-00653-P10007 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 10.14 <o,Q4,C,P1> i most enjoy spending my time with my brother because we have quite the same age and we have the same idea we share a lot of things in common a lot of activities
SI127E-00653-P10007 1 SI127E-00653 10.14 15.20 <o,Q4,C,P1> for example we we like to play together basketball or football
SI127E-00653-P10007 1 SI127E-00653 15.20 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and we do slo we do lots share lots of (acti-) activities together
SI127E-00653-P10008 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 15.52 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would like to be a financial engineering working more precisely in the market and the in the risk using for example model and (%hesitation%) (c-) data science to solve real financial problem
SI127E-00653-P10008 1 SI127E-00653 15.52 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) to give an idea about how the assets will evolve in
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 9.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> one important advantage of (%hesitation%) taking a job that will pay for university studies is that we don't have to take a credit
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 9.14 20.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this is important because (%hesitation%) we we will not find ourself limited by this credit and spend all the time (%hesitation%) following our study we'll have to pay for it
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 20.81 32.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) and a disadvantage of (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) idea is that sometimes we are not we are distracted and we will not focus on our studies and will feel like we are wasting our time
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 32.81 38.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i strongly believe that it depend of the courses or the master you choose
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 38.91 43.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you have enough time you can do a job at the same times
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 43.02 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> and however if you are really (%hesitation%) focused on your studies and you are concentrate concentrated and you don't have time at all so i recommend student to focus on their studies first and then pay for their (%hesitation%) universities (%hesitation%) studies by taking credit
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 6.32 <o,Q4,C,P4> so there are different steps for (%hesitation%) for people in order to take the plane
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 6.32 16.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> for example the first thing they have to do is to come to the of course is to the airport by using (%hesitation%) (tra-) different way of (%hesitation%) transport
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 16.09 21.84 <o,Q4,C,P4> they can use taxi or a truck or public transport or their own car
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 21.84 25.63 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then the first then the following step is the check in
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 25.63 41.66 <o,Q4,C,P4> and (%hesitation%) they have for example when they come with the luggage so they need to put their (lu-) to check in their luggage and then there is then (%hesitation%) there is document control so then you have to present your passport and your (%hesitation%) different documents
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 41.66 52.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> the following step the security you need to (ch-) (%hesitation%) people check their hand baggage they check (%hesitation%) that (y-) you have with you there control security control
SI127E-00653-P40018 1 SI127E-00653 52.00 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then we have to wait before the (ta-) before joining the plane in order to travel
SI127E-00653-P50019 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 15.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i strongly believe that technology have a great impact on studying (%hesitation%) because for example the different lecture are can be recorded and student can see them another time and try to to focus on what they don't understand by checking online
SI127E-00653-P50019 1 SI127E-00653 15.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> another important point is that it facilities a
SI127E-00653-P50020 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 8.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> face to face (%hesitation%) face to face studying is also really important because you stay focused
SI127E-00653-P50020 1 SI127E-00653 8.75 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and when you are you are in front of a student so we have these times dedicated for studying and you will feel like you are more concentrated than if you have to study online everything can distract you
SI127E-00653-P50021 1 SI127E-00653 0.00 5.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think working together is (%hesitation%) important things for develop a lot of str skills
SI127E-00653-P50021 1 SI127E-00653 5.59 12.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example which student will (wi-) will try to listen to other try to understand what the other people are saying their opinion

SI127E-00675-P30017 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 23.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> today we live in an international and interconnected world so i strongly believe that learning a foreign language (y-) will be always useful for students (%hesitation%) especially if they are to be (%hesitation%) to go abroad for their work or for their leisure
SI127E-00675-P30017 1 SI127E-00675 23.82 28.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> this way they they can speak another language
SI127E-00675-P30017 1 SI127E-00675 28.87 42.03 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) however (%hesitation%) the time spent to learn this foreign language can't interfere with studying other courses
SI127E-00675-P30017 1 SI127E-00675 42.03 50.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> so some students might prefer studying their major and focusing on their core studies
SI127E-00675-P30017 1 SI127E-00675 50.41 57.27 <o,Q5,C,P3> personally i strongly agree that we should (%hesitation%) learn a foreign language

SI127E-00675-P50019 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 17.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the easiest way to find out about international news is is to go on internet and to look for international newspapers and to read then the articles and the headlines
SI127E-00675-P50019 1 SI127E-00675 17.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can find really different countries'
SI127E-00675-P50020 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think maybe the paper version of newspaper will progressively disappear but (%hesitation%) they will adapt the format of this newspaper and present it in digital ways
SI127E-00675-P50021 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 7.15 <o,Q4,C,P5> i strongly disagree with the idea that social media are a reliable source of news

SI127E-00675-P50022 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 9.17 <o,Q4,C,P5> as local news will have the highest impact on your daily life i think they are quite important to follow
SI127E-00675-P50022 1 SI127E-00675 9.17 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) besides you can learn about local specificities or new events events that can occur in your town
SI127E-00675-P50023 1 SI127E-00675 0.00 7.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think the media just tells us what is really happening in the world
SI127E-00675-P50023 1 SI127E-00675 7.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so if there is there are bad news it's because we are in difficult situations and that we should be aware that the world is not functioning well and to act about it

SI127E-00688-P10005 1 SI127E-00688 13.51 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and also i always want for some activities to do to improve the (environ-)

SI127E-00688-P10006 1 SI127E-00688 12.81 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and we love (%hesitation%) trying new dishes for example the desserts and we love chocolate
SI127E-00688-P10007 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 13.84 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i would say that the person to who i'm similar to is my mum because i'm really (s-) seems very similar to her physically
SI127E-00688-P10007 1 SI127E-00688 13.84 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) we are the same kind of people (%hesitation%) like a ray of sunshine
SI127E-00688-P10008 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 6.67 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i would say that i want to live in united states or canada
SI127E-00688-P10008 1 SI127E-00688 6.67 8.37 <o,Q5,C,P1> i want to live in america
SI127E-00688-P10008 1 SI127E-00688 8.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) maybe in five years i see myself living and working there as a technology teacher and who knows maybe with family
SI127E-00688-P30017 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 7.09 <o,Q5,C,P3> to start with i want to draw your attention to the importance of fitness classes during (t-) (%hesitation%) students' life
SI127E-00688-P30017 1 SI127E-00688 7.09 22.90 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) regarding what are what the advantages are i would say that (%hesitation%) it is very (essen-) it's essential to mention that they are going to learn some healthy habits during their classes
SI127E-00688-P30017 1 SI127E-00688 22.90 44.11 <o,Q5,C,P3> and what the disadvantages (%hesitation%) are i must outline that (%hesitation%) they are having less lessons about something for example very important for me for (ex-) it's (%hesitation%) the body movement and for example their feelings
SI127E-00688-P30017 1 SI127E-00688 44.11 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> and were i to talk about my own opinion i would say that they have to have more hours about fitness classes because (%hesitation%) they are going to create some healthy habits for example doing some exercise
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 10.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> to start with i want to draw your attention to the importance of honey and the way that they have to follow to have some honey
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 10.91 25.58 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and first of all and to start with the (per-) bees has to collect that (n-) nectar from the flowers and depending the kind of the flowers they are they are going to have some different honey
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 25.58 34.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) they have to collect that (%hesitation%) nectar inside the beehives
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 34.09 37.78 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the beekeepers have to collect that honey
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 37.78 49.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then they have to put it in some jars (bef-) (%hesitation%) after having some kind of treatment about the honey
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 49.66 55.03 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then they are going to collect that jars to go to the supermarket
SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 55.03 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you can deserve that in for example a dessert
SI127E-00688-P50019 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 2.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's a very difficult question
SI127E-00688-P50019 1 SI127E-00688 2.02 17.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that's the most important thing that they have to (th-) think about is the simple way to go there because if he they have any problem their parents have to come
SI127E-00688-P50019 1 SI127E-00688 17.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think that they have a a good way to go
SI127E-00688-P50020 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 13.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well when you're studying in a second language (%hesitation%) you are developing your brain in two ways and you are open (y-) the doors to work in an international company
SI127E-00688-P50020 1 SI127E-00688 13.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you can go abroad and earn many so much money
SI127E-00688-P50021 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 8.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well well one of the problems is that you feel alone in another country and you miss your parents and your relative ones
SI127E-00688-P50021 1 SI127E-00688 8.27 14.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) maybe you can't (%hesitation%) make new friends
SI127E-00688-P50021 1 SI127E-00688 14.88 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> or you have (%hesitation%) some problems related to
SI127E-00688-P50022 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well (%hesitation%) the best way to learn a (l-) about local culture is to meet new friends that can't (%hesitation%) show you the local culture for example trying new dishes and making new recipes of their plates that you are (tasti-)
SI127E-00688-P50023 1 SI127E-00688 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well (%hesitation%) i think that (%hesitation%) you have to look for your life when you are abroad so (%hesitation%) you have you know how to (%hesitation%) deal with problems and how to solve it quickly and maybe to ask for help when you are lost
SI127E-00693-P10005 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 3.13 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am not really interested in the environment
SI127E-00693-P10005 1 SI127E-00693 3.13 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> on the other hand i do really think that it's an important topic that we all need to (%hesitation%) talk about and bearing in mind
SI127E-00693-P10006 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 9.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> me and my friends do really enjoy going shopping due to fact that we are all girls and we really like to do a girly things
SI127E-00693-P10006 1 SI127E-00693 9.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> on the other hand i do really think that there are many other things that we can do such as going to a park
SI127E-00693-P10007 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 2.67 <o,Q5,C,P1> look like anybody my family
SI127E-00693-P10007 1 SI127E-00693 2.67 7.51 <o,Q5,C,P1> meanwhile there is it's true that i do really look like my grandmother
SI127E-00693-P10007 1 SI127E-00693 7.51 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and this is because we are very similar in facial characteristics and also in other topics such as personality
SI127E-00693-P10008 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 9.34 <o,Q5,C,P1> i really have thought about and i am pretty sure that i'm gonna stay here in madrid which is a country i've been living in for many years
SI127E-00693-P10008 1 SI127E-00693 9.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i do really like my friends and all my surroundings so that's why i am staying here for pretty much all my life
SI127E-00693-P30017 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 6.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i would say one of the advantages is that they will be able to be much more fit and healthy
SI127E-00693-P30017 1 SI127E-00693 6.91 17.18 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand one of the disadvantages would be that they aren't able to use that school time to study which will affect their final grades
SI127E-00693-P30017 1 SI127E-00693 17.18 31.03 <o,Q5,C,P3> meanwhile my own opinion is that i find it's something really useful for them students to do due to the fact that plenty of students need an extra push within doing sports
SI127E-00693-P30017 1 SI127E-00693 31.03 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> i do really find fitness classes really useful and i think it's something really necessary
SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 5.57 <o,Q5,C,P4> well the honey production process may sound more complex than it really is
SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 5.57 13.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) it's composed of various stages in which the bee is the most important factor
SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 13.38 18.94 <o,Q5,C,P4> the bees collect nectar from flowers and then they make nectar in their beehives
SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 18.94 33.06 <o,Q5,C,P4> beekeepers would have (%hesitation%) need to have a correct clothing in order to be safe from this the stings from this instecs insects collect the honey from the beehives and then pour it in different containers
SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 33.06 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> with a delivery process they put the containers inside a a car or a vehicle and then they deliver this to a supermarket which is (%hesitation%) the final phase which enables you to buy it and consume it in your house as a customer
SI127E-00693-P50019 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that in order to choose a country is really important to feel a slight bond with the culture of that country and being able to have a conversation maybe understanding the basic language in order to communicate with them and their religion (ob-) obviously also
SI127E-00693-P50020 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 17.89 <o,Q5,C,P5> of studying in a second language is that you can develop skills which you can not (%hesitation%) do if you're speak in your native language such as being (%hesitation%) able to use gestures to explain things which you cannot explain with words
SI127E-00693-P50020 1 SI127E-00693 17.89 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's really important
SI127E-00693-P50021 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 7.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> the behaviour of others which have different beliefs make it difficult to understand them
SI127E-00693-P50021 1 SI127E-00693 7.47 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and we maybe (%hesitation%) feel a something is (%hesitation%) being made wrong when it it is essentially the way they do it there
SI127E-00693-P50022 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 1.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00693-P50022 1 SI127E-00693 1.98 8.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> not to feel as you already know a lot of a country even if you have been a lot of time there
SI127E-00693-P50022 1 SI127E-00693 8.23 17.69 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's really important to look for new things to look for maybe (%hesitation%) new values new ethics new beliefs from others
SI127E-00693-P50022 1 SI127E-00693 17.69 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and really making them
SI127E-00693-P50023 1 SI127E-00693 0.00 7.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> helps becoming independent because you build new skills which you didn't know you have you had
SI127E-00693-P50023 1 SI127E-00693 7.81 12.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you are able to do different things that you're used to
SI127E-00693-P50023 1 SI127E-00693 12.37 18.25 <o,Q5,C,P5> you are (%hesitation%) able to (%hesitation%) do things for yourself not relying on others
SI127E-00693-P50023 1 SI127E-00693 18.25 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's really interesting
SI127E-00713-P10005 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 2.70 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) environment is life

SI127E-00713-P10005 1 SI127E-00713 11.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's a better way to to make a better world to live and the quality of air
SI127E-00713-P10006 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) we love to dance and sing and and going to karaoke (%hesitation%) or sometimes (%hesitation%) we we (w-) we went (%hesitation%) we going to the cinema

SI127E-00713-P10007 1 SI127E-00713 6.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we talking for hours and we know each other very well

SI127E-00713-P30017 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 26.35 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think to do fitness is a is a very well (%hesitation%) is a very good idea for it the sports give them a lot of positive things to their body and to their attitude
SI127E-00713-P30017 1 SI127E-00713 26.35 33.89 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantage (%hesitation%) i think there are no disadvantage
SI127E-00713-P30017 1 SI127E-00713 33.89 36.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> there are time for everything
SI127E-00713-P30017 1 SI127E-00713 36.78 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion it's it's good to (%hesitation%) begin at the first hour of school (%hesitation%) do fitness for everyone every age of college
SI127E-00713-P40018 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 26.23 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) honey is produced by bees (%hesitation%) that produce that make honey from the nectar there there from the nectar collect from flowers

SI127E-00713-P50020 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 12.04 <o,Q4,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) an advantage is to you enter in the globalisation area of jobs
SI127E-00713-P50020 1 SI127E-00713 12.04 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> you'll (ha-) you (sh-) could have level
SI127E-00713-P50021 1 SI127E-00713 0.00 10.77 <o,Q4,A2,P5> the main difficulty is the the culture and the language
SI127E-00713-P50021 1 SI127E-00713 10.77 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) it could be difficult for you or different way to be

SI127E-00720-P30017 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 30.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well if all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course i i believe that one advantage well one of the (mo-) the most important advantage are that they can to to learn a new skill to travel (whe-) where they want to a place that they can choose
SI127E-00720-P30017 1 SI127E-00720 30.16 42.77 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example if i like united states i i will be learn english and but nevertheless if i love german i will learn too dutch
SI127E-00720-P30017 1 SI127E-00720 42.77 44.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disadvantage are the time
SI127E-00720-P30017 1 SI127E-00720 44.73 48.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you will have less time every time
SI127E-00720-P30017 1 SI127E-00720 48.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think all the schools have to have to do this opportunity to all their students
SI127E-00720-P50019 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 13.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING

SI127E-00720-P50020 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 17.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well indeed i am agree with the case that there will not be newspapers with paper because it it is very problem with the environment
SI127E-00720-P50020 1 SI127E-00720 17.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> all the newspapers will be digital in my
SI127E-00720-P50021 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 15.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in my opinion i think that yes we can we can have faith in the social media because (%hesitation%) around the world a lot of new people are in social media
SI127E-00720-P50021 1 SI127E-00720 15.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and when we (s-) we watch some bad news
SI127E-00720-P50022 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 15.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that is crucial because the local news occurs around our city and can affect to our family and our friends
SI127E-00720-P50022 1 SI127E-00720 15.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> indeed i think are very important
SI127E-00720-P50023 1 SI127E-00720 0.00 8.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion i am agree with that information because there are a lot of people that post bad news

SI127E-00759-P30017 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 5.53 <o,Q5,B2,P3> there are more advantage than disadvantage for starters
SI127E-00759-P30017 1 SI127E-00759 5.53 27.11 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and advantage of doing this type of class could be that (%hesitation%) the benefits that this class products for the health students to prevent (%hesitation%) some illness or other problems
SI127E-00759-P30017 1 SI127E-00759 27.11 43.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and on other hand (%hesitation%) disadvantage could be that the students (%hesitation%) after these class have the need take quick shower and shake their clothes
SI127E-00759-P30017 1 SI127E-00759 43.98 60.35 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and finally in my opinion i think that this type of class is very important because student have the need to learnt about the lifestyle
SI127E-00759-P40018 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 11.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> with help from with help of this diagram i will explain how honey is produced
SI127E-00759-P40018 1 SI127E-00759 11.70 16.69 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the first place the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-00759-P40018 1 SI127E-00759 16.69 21.05 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after bees make make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00759-P40018 1 SI127E-00759 21.05 27.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI127E-00759-P40018 1 SI127E-00759 27.27 60.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and when beekeepers collect honey from beehives before (%hesitation%) but this but it put this honey on recipients and these recipients are collect are collected by bow by people who who commerce this type of honey in some supermarket
SI127E-00759-P50019 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 10.58 <o,Q4,B2,P5> firstly they have to see if it is a beautiful country without any kind of war
SI127E-00759-P50019 1 SI127E-00759 10.58 20.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> secondly (%hesitation%) they have to see if it is a country suitable for young students
SI127E-00759-P50020 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 18.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> studying on a second language have a lot of advantage but the most important is that in the future you will have a lot of opportunity in the professional work because in many job there are very important to have more than one language
SI127E-00759-P50020 1 SI127E-00759 18.00 21.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also you are intelligent
SI127E-00759-P50021 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 10.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that they will find more difficult in the methods of learnt and in the teachers

SI127E-00759-P50022 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 11.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i recommend that they (buy-) a historical book and read it every night before bed
SI127E-00759-P50022 1 SI127E-00759 11.88 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they should also talk with local people because they know a lot of
SI127E-00759-P50023 1 SI127E-00759 0.00 18.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i agree with this opinion because it's the reality when you you living alone you have more responsibility and more obligations without your parents
SI127E-00759-P50023 1 SI127E-00759 18.53 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you are
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 0.00 6.33 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i will presentate about how honey is produced
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 6.33 10.52 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the (pro-) the process of honey has many steps
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 10.52 16.98 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first honey do you know what who made honey
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 16.98 18.29 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this is bee
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 18.29 22.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so first bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 22.34 27.48 <o,Q4,B1,P4> these flowers' flavour is important for the honey flavor
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 27.48 33.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then bee makes honey from nectar in beehives beehives
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 33.87 39.58 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then beekeepers collect honey from their beehives
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 39.58 48.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so finally the (b-) honey are bottled and moved to the store
SI127E-00763-P40018 1 SI127E-00763 48.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this is the way the honey is produced and the process to the buying in the supermarket or store
SI127E-00772-P10005 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 10.18 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm really interested in learning to play the guitar because i love it this instrument
SI127E-00772-P10005 1 SI127E-00772 10.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i was a child my father played and i remember that
SI127E-00772-P10006 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy a lot travelling but i can't do it as many times as i want because i haven't much holidays in my job
SI127E-00772-P10007 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 9.40 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like to meet shakira because it's my favourite singer
SI127E-00772-P10007 1 SI127E-00772 9.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i like (%hesitation%) how she's dancing and i would like to learn
SI127E-00772-P10008 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 16.65 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my opinion (%hesitation%) speaking english is useful for to my job because i have to travel (%hesitation%) to meet client
SI127E-00772-P10008 1 SI127E-00772 16.65 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and some of them only speak
SI127E-00772-P30017 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 24.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i consider that if you (s-) if you study (%hesitation%) one foreign language it could let you have more opportunities to find a great job when you finish your university
SI127E-00772-P30017 1 SI127E-00772 24.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> however in addiction i in my i consider study other language is something additional to to your goals and i consider it's not a requirement to pass the course the course
SI127E-00772-P50019 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 10.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i consider the best way to find news could be on the internet
SI127E-00772-P50019 1 SI127E-00772 10.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because in this media you can research
SI127E-00772-P50020 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 4.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) yes (%hesitation%) i agree
SI127E-00772-P50020 1 SI127E-00772 4.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> although as i see it the newspapers don't see it in the future because all news are on
SI127E-00772-P50021 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 2.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> no
SI127E-00772-P50021 1 SI127E-00772 2.46 16.90 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider that now the social media it's quite fake because you show that you want
SI127E-00772-P50021 1 SI127E-00772 16.90 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not everything it's real
SI127E-00772-P50022 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 2.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's quite important
SI127E-00772-P50022 1 SI127E-00772 2.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because (%hesitation%) if you don't understand or not listening the local news of where you live you don't know how to do if something it's
SI127E-00772-P50023 1 SI127E-00772 0.00 9.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> personally nowadays i listen as good news as bad news
SI127E-00772-P50023 1 SI127E-00772 9.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't agree with that because (%hesitation%) all over the world has both things
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 0.00 9.74 <o,Q5,C,P4> okay i'm going to (%hesitation%) give a presentation about travelling by airplane taking into account the information of this diagram
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 9.74 12.50 <o,Q5,C,P4> first and foremost you need to travel to airport
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 12.50 17.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can do it by bus by train or by car
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 17.68 23.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you reach the airport and need to do the check in
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 23.14 27.81 <o,Q5,C,P4> you need to put your luggage and it will be and it will be check
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 27.81 32.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> also you need to be you need to be prepare for the document control
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 32.39 43.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> you have your i d and pass the security (c-) (%hesitation%) the security control and wait until your (%hesitation%) your airplane comes
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 43.41 51.16 <o,Q5,C,P4> and you can spend time (%hesitation%) eating or (%hesitation%) spending your money (%hesitation%) on the shops
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 51.16 56.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then finally last but not least (%hesitation%) you need to board
SI127E-00779-P40018 1 SI127E-00779 56.09 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then (%hesitation%) the airplane takes off
SI127E-00790-P10005 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i'm very interested in music but only in a specific genre of music which is o s ts original soundtracks for from films and video games
SI127E-00790-P10005 1 SI127E-00790 14.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love that genre but not other kinds of music
SI127E-00790-P10006 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 5.48 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love travelling around the world especially to other countries
SI127E-00790-P10006 1 SI127E-00790 5.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) i think it's (%hesitation%) it's the best way to know about other cultures to meet new people from different places and such
SI127E-00790-P10007 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 3.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> oh that's a (%hesitation%) difficult question
SI127E-00790-P10007 1 SI127E-00790 3.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would say some (%hesitation%) scientist probably like albert einstein because that would be (%hesitation%) that would be memorable to know about their life (%hesitation%) how they achieved (w-)

SI127E-00790-P30017 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 10.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages would be that (%hesitation%) students would have (%hesitation%) more job opportunities in other countries
SI127E-00790-P30017 1 SI127E-00790 10.02 22.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and before that (%hesitation%) you could (m-) (%hesitation%) get more practical experiences in other countries or in other aspects of your field
SI127E-00790-P30017 1 SI127E-00790 22.41 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantage (%hesitation%) the main disadvantage would be that of course you would have less time to devote to your studies (%hesitation%) press key press key
SI127E-00790-P50019 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 12.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the more reliable way to (%hesitation%) learn about international news is (%hesitation%) reading international newspaper
SI127E-00790-P50019 1 SI127E-00790 12.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you could also (%hesitation%) use social media but not as (re-) reliable of course
SI127E-00790-P50020 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 1.65 <o,Q5,B2,P5> definitely not
SI127E-00790-P50020 1 SI127E-00790 1.65 8.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that newspapers will be there but (%hesitation%) i think they would be different
SI127E-00790-P50020 1 SI127E-00790 8.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) paper newspapers in paper (%hesitation%) would (%hesitation%) will disappear in the future but online newspaper will not
SI127E-00790-P50021 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 10.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not at all because (%hesitation%) in social media fake news are more easily spread than in traditional newspapers
SI127E-00790-P50021 1 SI127E-00790 10.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) lies untruthful news are more easily spread and that's that's definitely dangerous
SI127E-00790-P50022 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 11.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that if you want to understand the world you you would need to understand what's happening around you in the first step
SI127E-00790-P50022 1 SI127E-00790 11.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (i-) it's it's important definitely
SI127E-00790-P50023 1 SI127E-00790 0.00 7.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that specially in covid (%hesitation%) pandemic times
SI127E-00790-P50023 1 SI127E-00790 7.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) we need some hope so more (%hesitation%) happy news would be advisable i think

SI127E-00792-P10008 1 SI127E-00792 0.00 15.25 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i always wanted to learn (%hesitation%) play the guitar (beca-) because i i have older friends that does know to to to play different instruments and sing a lot

SI127E-00792-P30017 1 SI127E-00792 0.00 11.47 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think (%hesitation%) one of the best advantage of this type of jobs is to get more experience for the future
SI127E-00792-P30017 1 SI127E-00792 11.47 20.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> students can go out with a degree and a very extensive experience in jobs

SI127E-00792-P30017 1 SI127E-00792 45.19 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion i think (%hesitation%) it's so useful to (%hesitation%) take a part time job because you can earn a lot of money that you can use to go out with our friends
SI127E-00792-P40018 1 SI127E-00792 0.00 11.70 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well (%hesitation%) first of all in this imagine (%hesitation%) image i can see (%hesitation%) the damage to environment (%hesitation%) caused by the acid rain

SI127E-00792-P40018 1 SI127E-00792 13.85 31.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so the pollution is created in factories that make (%hesitation%) some particles (%hesitation%) like a hume and smoke that go to the to the the clouds
SI127E-00792-P40018 1 SI127E-00792 31.06 38.01 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and acid particles are carried by the winds that mix (%hesitation%) with the clouds
SI127E-00792-P40018 1 SI127E-00792 38.01 53.07 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and when some acid particles fall downs but another ones then take part of the clouds and when it's raining (%hesitation%) this particles are in rain or snow to the environment
SI127E-00792-P40018 1 SI127E-00792 53.07 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this damage so much though (%hesitation%) and is so worse for the planets

SI127E-00809-P40018 1 SI127E-00809 8.43 12.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00809-P40018 1 SI127E-00809 12.33 18.11 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that the beekeeper collects honey from the beehives

SI127E-00809-P40018 1 SI127E-00809 35.80 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that's it the cycle of the honey
SI127E-00813-P40018 1 SI127E-00813 0.00 8.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you must choose a means of of transport just to get to the airport

SI127E-00830-P10008 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i guess speak english help me to get a better work in the future and (%hesitation%) give me the chance to speak with other persons of other countries who speak english too
SI127E-00830-P30017 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 26.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if you study a foreign language during your (%hesitation%) college years you have the chance to travel and (%hesitation%) speak english with other persons of other countries who don't speak (%hesitation%) your own language
SI127E-00830-P30017 1 SI127E-00830 26.71 44.10 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) the main disadvantage to study another language is you have less time to study the the other subjects of your (%hesitation%) grade
SI127E-00830-P30017 1 SI127E-00830 44.10 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but finally i think it's a good (%hesitation%) chance to learn about other language and improve your language skills
SI127E-00830-P50019 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the best way to find out about international news for students is (%hesitation%) to search some information in the press in internet surf about different (%hesitation%) webs
SI127E-00830-P50020 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i disagree with that because the newspaper are really important to keep us informated and to know about the different realities of our world and the different regions
SI127E-00830-P50021 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the social media aren't a reliable (%hesitation%) resource because in the in in this are many fake news every day
SI127E-00830-P50022 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's really important to know about the local news because you have to know about the what is happening around you and the people you have near and you love it
SI127E-00830-P50023 1 SI127E-00830 0.00 8.47 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i guess that (%hesitation%) unfortunately the the worse it it isn't the the news
SI127E-00830-P50023 1 SI127E-00830 8.47 12.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the the worse is the reality
SI127E-00830-P50023 1 SI127E-00830 12.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and we have (%hesitation%) an effort to make the world a better place

SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 0.88 4.25 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i've heard that you want to choose a pop music site
SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 4.25 8.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so there is a seven days flowchart for those three music site
SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 8.98 13.99 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and in the first day as we can see the music now is the most (p-) popular
SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 13.99 21.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the second one is songs four you and the most the lowest one is (%hesitation%) tunes net
SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 21.57 30.15 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) but after three days (%hesitation%) those (%hesitation%) those three (%hesitation%) apps have some small change
SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 30.15 38.43 <o,Q5,B2,P4> for the tuna tunes net and the songs four you have a little bit increased but for the music now is a bit little bit decreased

SI127E-00848-P40018 1 SI127E-00848 50.34 55.47 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and as we can see results now the tunes net is the most popular

SI127E-00853-P10008 1 SI127E-00853 0.00 17.03 <o,Q5,B2,P1> nowadays english it's basic (%hesitation%) not not only for for people for example (%hesitation%) as as in what business is concerned english is very important because maybe you will have to live with some some people that doesn't speak your language
SI127E-00853-P10008 1 SI127E-00853 17.03 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it's very important to to
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 0.00 5.03 <o,Q5,B2,P3> all students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 5.03 9.03 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) obviously that has some advantages and some disadvantages
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 9.03 22.96 <o,Q5,B2,P3> maybe those advantages (%hesitation%) would be that you have a skill that maybe depending on the language that you the foreign language that you study or you learn you have a skill that other maybe other persons doesn't (d-) don't have
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 22.96 35.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) also you will be able for example to speak an advantage that that language depending on the language that you speak you will be able to speak with other people that are not from your country so that's an advantage too
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 35.77 44.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> beside beside studying that language you maybe (%hesitation%) could live in another country that the language is (spe-) is spoken and you have studied
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 44.92 53.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantage maybe is that you have to invest some money in it that maybe you would use it to to pay some bills or other things that you maybe need also
SI127E-00853-P30017 1 SI127E-00853 53.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion it is it is mandatory because maybe in your future in a long term you
SI127E-00853-P50019 1 SI127E-00853 0.00 8.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think the best way to to know or to to be aware of international news it's internet
SI127E-00853-P50019 1 SI127E-00853 8.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> at internet we can find out a lot of (%hesitation%) newspapers a lot of (%hesitation%) news that can make you be be connected or be aware of what is happening

SI127E-00853-P50021 1 SI127E-00853 11.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's not a reliable source because it's not (%hesitation%) well (d-) doesn't go through some filters in order to
SI127E-00853-P50022 1 SI127E-00853 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think it's quite important to be up to date at the local news because you are living there and if it's happening something that is really important or or it may be harmful for for yourself or for or for some people you should be aware of it and you should take it into account when you do the the things that you used to do

SI127E-00885-P10008 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 3.47 <o,Q4,B2,P1> english is the the business language
SI127E-00885-P10008 1 SI127E-00885 3.47 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and in my opinion if you learn (a-) (%hesitation%) english in a good way (%hesitation%) you probably have a good a good job in the future
SI127E-00885-P30017 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 10.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> nowadays a lot of students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI127E-00885-P30017 1 SI127E-00885 10.32 11.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my
SI127E-00885-P30017 1 SI127E-00885 11.84 24.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and like advantages is these these students learn a lot about this other language
SI127E-00885-P30017 1 SI127E-00885 24.22 41.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> like disadvantages at the at the beginning probably these (%hesitation%) studies are so difficult and so intense and the students should be need to work a lot
SI127E-00885-P30017 1 SI127E-00885 41.40 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion it's a good way to to learn to learn a lot of new new language but it's so difficult
SI127E-00885-P50019 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 9.43 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion the best way to students to know about international news is looking twitter
SI127E-00885-P50019 1 SI127E-00885 9.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> twitter all moves and looking in there
SI127E-00885-P50020 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 4.79 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the newspaper in my opinion is impossible that disappear
SI127E-00885-P50020 1 SI127E-00885 4.79 17.12 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but probably (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) in the next ten years (%hesitation%) don't publicate in paper only in online webs
SI127E-00885-P50020 1 SI127E-00885 17.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because now only buy the old (peo-)
SI127E-00885-P50021 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 2.93 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes is to say twitter
SI127E-00885-P50021 1 SI127E-00885 2.93 13.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> twitter is the social media that all the news (%hesitation%) moves so (%hesitation%) fast
SI127E-00885-P50021 1 SI127E-00885 13.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and a lot of people known this news about the social media

SI127E-00885-P50022 1 SI127E-00885 15.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but in my case i never see the local news
SI127E-00885-P50023 1 SI127E-00885 0.00 11.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think a part is true because the social media (%hesitation%) introduce a lot of fake news and bad news
SI127E-00885-P50023 1 SI127E-00885 11.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but so (%hesitation%) (a-) (a-) although is so important to the (socie-)

SI127E-00886-P10008 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 14.60 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think english helps me very much in the future (%hesitation%) because i want to work and go (%hesitation%) in abroad
SI127E-00886-P10008 1 SI127E-00886 14.60 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so i have to speak english in the future
SI127E-00886-P30017 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 10.36 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think the progress of globalism is (%hesitation%) fast so we have to learn a second language

SI127E-00886-P30017 1 SI127E-00886 17.23 29.58 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) meanwhile the disadvantage is (%hesitation%) it could be a waste of time for him who want to more professional about one thing
SI127E-00886-P30017 1 SI127E-00886 29.58 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) eventually my own opinion is (%hesitation%) studying a foreign language is a nice thing (%hesitation%) because i say the progress of (global-) globalism is a nice thing
SI127E-00886-P50019 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the best way to know the international news for student is (%hesitation%) internet (%hesitation%) because internet can use everyone and (%hesitation%) it is a very fast to get a information
SI127E-00886-P50020 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 2.33 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think so too

SI127E-00886-P50020 1 SI127E-00886 11.83 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so i think there are no newspapers in the future
SI127E-00886-P50021 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the reliable on the social media is (%hesitation%) too low (%hesitation%) because social media can use everyone so the reliable information is (%hesitation%) a few
SI127E-00886-P50022 1 SI127E-00886 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the keep up to local news is (%hesitation%) very important (%hesitation%) because the local regions region want to know own local region's news

SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 4.18 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> so the first step you need to travel to the airport and you can choose car or bus or train
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 11.61 21.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> and when you get into the airport you'll be checking for the for your ticket and you can mail your (%hesitation%) bags in there
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 21.75 25.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> so afterward you can do the document control
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 25.36 32.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> you will show your i d and passport to the workers and then it's the security part
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 32.13 35.53 <o,Q5,C,P4> they will checks for weapons or some dangerous things
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 35.53 38.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> you don't carry it you can't go into the waiting room
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 38.36 45.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> so in there you have the cafe time or buy some gift or have the washroom and dinners in there
SI127E-00898-P40018 1 SI127E-00898 45.78 51.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> so when you get get to the take off time for the plane you can go to aboard

SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 5.99 16.93 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in fact you need to travel to the airport first usually by car bus or train depending on the facilities of your town or city
SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 16.93 34.99 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you will need to arrive about two hours and a half before the plane takes off as you will need to pass through the check in the document controls and also security controls which will be (%hesitation%) quite harder
SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 34.99 49.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) moreover after all this controls you will have a lot of time if everything has gone as (%hesitation%) wished (%hesitation%) to spend in the airport
SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 49.22 51.39 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you can have a meal
SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 51.39 53.13 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can go shopping
SI127E-00903-P40018 1 SI127E-00903 53.13 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally you will board and the plane will take off

SI127E-00921-P10008 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 11.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in the (fut-) in the future i would like to travel or maybe doing a master degree on in england in england so it's necessary that i speak english
SI127E-00921-P10008 1 SI127E-00921 11.61 18.84 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i also want to to teach (%hesitation%) maths in in english
SI127E-00921-P10008 1 SI127E-00921 18.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 8.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) an argument favour that i would say here is in university you have to study (%hesitation%) a lot of things
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 8.56 20.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and some books they are just in in (s-) in english or maybe in other language so it's important to to to to know other language to to to to read these books
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 20.54 36.83 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) ones advantages i would say that not not everyone (%hesitation%) have the opportunity to learn (%hesitation%) a language because if you if you have (%hesitation%) because not everyone can pay a a course language
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 36.83 50.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion the (gov-) the (gov-) the government should (%hesitation%) should proportionate (%hesitation%) should give class (%hesitation%) in the university (%hesitation%) subjects
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 50.82 56.07 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and ah i have to think again

SI127E-00921-P50019 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i would say that way to students find out (%hesitation%) (inte-) international news (%hesitation%) is the is on on the internet because you can easily find (%hesitation%) news from on from over over the world and you can do that free
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i totally agree because i think that nowadays everything is now (digi-) digital digital digital
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921 9.55 18.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) so maybe now (%hesitation%) we already have newspapers on paper because of (%hesitation%) the old people the elderly
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921 18.86 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) so

SI127E-00921-P50021 1 SI127E-00921 14.31 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i wouldn't recommend this way to to know about
SI127E-00921-P50022 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 7.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's it's so important because they have to know what is happening in your surround
SI127E-00921-P50022 1 SI127E-00921 7.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) if you maybe if you if you talk with with a friend and then they they talks about something that will that happen (%hesitation%) in your neighbourhood you need
SI127E-00921-P50023 1 SI127E-00921 0.00 10.81 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i totally agree because i think that bad news is what attract people because they are interested in this thing
SI127E-00921-P50023 1 SI127E-00921 10.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but personally i don't like it because i would prefer see watch something like politics economy or
SI127E-00936-P40018 1 SI127E-00936 0.00 11.28 <o,Q5,A2,P4> i am going to talk about how pollution cause acid rain

SI127E-00957-P40018 1 SI127E-00957 14.62 29.60 <o,Q5,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00957-P40018 1 SI127E-00957 29.60 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then this dealer (%hesitation%) give to supermarket (%hesitation%) the jars (%hesitation%) contains the honey and the supermarket sell (%hesitation%) to everyone (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) honey
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 0.00 3.72 <o,Q5,C,P4> all right people welcome to this presentation on honey
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 3.72 5.69 <o,Q5,C,P4> i decided to call it from flower to shop
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 5.69 11.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> now (%hesitation%) i'll be running through the process so you can really understand how honey is made
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 11.56 18.53 <o,Q5,C,P4> but if you have any further question please raise your hand and i'll be glad to answer your doubts or queries
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 18.53 19.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> right
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 19.30 23.24 <o,Q5,C,P4> now first things first (%hesitation%) bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 23.24 26.93 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think this is a natural process and everybody is aware of that
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 26.93 33.53 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) afterwards (%hesitation%) these bees (%hesitation%) take this honey to the (%hesitation%) to a beehive
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 33.53 34.60 <o,Q5,C,P4> now what's a beehive
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 34.60 39.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> a beehive is some sorta house that is located on top part of trees
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 39.41 40.16 <o,Q5,C,P4> right
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 40.16 43.87 <o,Q5,C,P4> then some beekeepers show up in order to collect all the honey
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 43.87 49.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) then this honey's put in jars in other words is industrialized
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 49.45 51.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this is a human process
SI127E-00958-P40018 1 SI127E-00958 51.91 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) afterwards there are loaded up (%hesitation%) in vans and they're transported to the local let's say store
SI127E-00995-P10005 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 15.59 <o,Q5,B1,P1> without doubt my favourite time of year is the summer because you can go outside a lot of time and i don't want to spend or maybe i don't like spend a lot of time in my house
SI127E-00995-P10005 1 SI127E-00995 15.59 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i prefer going out with my friends
SI127E-00995-P10006 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P1> for me it's something very important because you need watching the news (%hesitation%) maybe no all through the all day but (%hesitation%) once per week because you must be informated about the things that occur your country
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 13.30 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well the most part of my time when i was child (%hesitation%) was with my friends in a park or maybe in the pool in the in the summer
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995 13.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i adored (%hesitation%) playing with my friends all time
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 9.62 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) obviously i hope to work in the job that i love that it's the lab
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995 9.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) probably i will stayed in madrid because then there are a lot of opportunities of work
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 13.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) for me it's (%hesitation%) very important to do the things that you will need to do in your future job
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 13.17 22.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and for this reason (%hesitation%) the include a period of practical work experience (%hesitation%) have a lot of advantages
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 22.56 51.18 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that its hasn't got any hasn't got disadvantages because the part (theor-) the theoretical part is very important but (%hesitation%) the most important things always will be (%hesitation%) the practical skills and in these cases when you (%hesitation%) demonstrate the things that you have learnt
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 51.18 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) for this reason is (%hesitation%) very essential to do practical work
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 11.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) well we have studied visits or to three news online pop music sites (a-) such as tunes net music now and song for you
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 11.62 32.07 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the most remarkable thing that we can watch in this graphic is that since the five day (%hesitation%) both in music now visits and so for you visits (%hesitation%) has decreased
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 32.07 37.94 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and for contrast in the tunes net the visits has increase
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 37.94 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) for to sum up although tunes net have start with low visits (%hesitation%) they it has finished with height visits
SI127E-00995-P50019 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P5> probably he or she must have (%hesitation%) good communication (%hesitation%) must be cheerful (%hesitation%) a lot of (soci-) sociable because they must be worried about the abilities of the team
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 8.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> obviously you can have mates who doesn't think like you
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995 8.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and probably you must or you want to work in a form that other people don't like
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 8.01 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think so because obviously all people must have the ability of think by self
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995 8.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and if you want that everyone think in the same the same obviously (%hesitation%) can be worse to individual person
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 10.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i don't think so because (%hesitation%) i think that you can have a good team without have face face to face teams
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995 10.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that the key is collaborate (%hesitation%) each other and be friends too
SI127E-00995-P50023 1 SI127E-00995 0.00 15.21 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well (%hesitation%) in my point of view it depends of the person because some people work better in groups and other people can work better alone
SI127E-00995-P50023 1 SI127E-00995 15.21 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it depend of the type of work too
SI127E-00996-P10005 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 2.96 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am really interested in the environment
SI127E-00996-P10005 1 SI127E-00996 2.96 7.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that people causes a lot of damage in the environment
SI127E-00996-P10005 1 SI127E-00996 7.35 14.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i love the environment and i want to solve the general problem that is facing right now
SI127E-00996-P10005 1 SI127E-00996 14.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i i am very concerned about that
SI127E-00996-P10006 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 12.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> me and my friends enjoy playing basketball and doing almost every sports in general for example playing soccer or american football
SI127E-00996-P10006 1 SI127E-00996 12.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> or even only going to eat something with them that's very greatful
SI127E-00996-P10007 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 3.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very similar to my mom
SI127E-00996-P10007 1 SI127E-00996 3.42 16.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that we have a lot of things in common because both we are like really timid and we don't want to spend a lot of time with people
SI127E-00996-P10007 1 SI127E-00996 16.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and because of that we have a really special (relatio-)
SI127E-00996-P10008 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 5.02 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to live in the united states
SI127E-00996-P10008 1 SI127E-00996 5.02 11.97 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that's a great country and more specifically i want to live in new york city
SI127E-00996-P10008 1 SI127E-00996 11.97 14.99 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that's a wonderful city
SI127E-00996-P10008 1 SI127E-00996 14.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love the views out there and the market out there is great
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 7.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> schools and college should make time in school day for all students do fitness classes
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 7.62 9.70 <o,Q5,B2,P3> of course they do
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 9.70 20.38 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages that you will have as college if you introduce fitness classes are the students will be more healthy
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 20.38 30.88 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantages for by the other hand are that many of them will be concern about those classes
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 30.88 53.15 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion i think those classes are fundamental for the kids because the fitness classes needs to be implemented nowadays because (%hesitation%) the students are really getting fat and they are not fit at all at all
SI127E-00996-P30017 1 SI127E-00996 53.15 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so they need to get improve in those areas where are not
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 14.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> here we have a diagram that shows how honey is recollected from flowers and then the honey is going to the shops
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 14.75 21.08 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first we have the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 21.08 27.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the bees make the honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 27.91 37.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after the bees made that we have the beekeepers that are collecting the honey from beehives
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 37.88 46.20 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that we have the the honey collected in recipients
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 46.20 54.53 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and after that we transport the (mer-) the merchandise to the stores
SI127E-00996-P40018 1 SI127E-00996 54.53 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you can buy the the honey
SI127E-00996-P50019 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 14.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to consider a lot of things for example if the country is far away from your natal country that's a big problem because you can't see your family (%hesitation%) in a long time
SI127E-00996-P50019 1 SI127E-00996 14.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that's the thing you have to consider the most
SI127E-00996-P50020 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 6.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you study a second language you have a lot of advantage out there in the working field
SI127E-00996-P50020 1 SI127E-00996 6.94 15.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have the advantage from other persons because you know other languages
SI127E-00996-P50020 1 SI127E-00996 15.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> even you can learn three or four languages
SI127E-00996-P50021 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 13.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you are studying in another country maybe it's difficult to you to made friends or to maybe sometimes understand really what the people wants
SI127E-00996-P50021 1 SI127E-00996 13.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you need to be focus study and be prepared for everything in your school
SI127E-00996-P50022 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 15.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you need to make friends local friends and then those local friends will teach you or give you some advices of how you can (%hesitation%) learn more about the local culture
SI127E-00996-P50022 1 SI127E-00996 15.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that will be so helpful for you
SI127E-00996-P50023 1 SI127E-00996 0.00 9.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's really accurate because if you're a student abroad you have like another thinking
SI127E-00996-P50023 1 SI127E-00996 9.35 17.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you you can develop a more independent thinking
SI127E-00996-P50023 1 SI127E-00996 17.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and because of that is great for the student
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 0.00 4.41 <o,Q5,C,P4> ok first of all you should know how to travel to the airport
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 4.41 6.93 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can do it by car by bus by train
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 6.93 25.92 <o,Q5,C,P4> after you arrive to the airport you must do the check in going through a document control and a (s-) and the security in order to because you are not able to pass some some things some stuff some some objects that are maybe (a-) are a danger in in the airport
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 25.92 29.60 <o,Q5,C,P4> after all when you passed all those controls you need to wait
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 29.60 30.92 <o,Q5,C,P4> wait to what
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 30.92 34.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> wait to to be able to board to the to the plane
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 34.98 44.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> and once you did all that that stages (%hesitation%) you just have to wait to the plane to take off
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 44.08 49.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> and that's how it goes the the travelling by airplane
SI127E-00997-P40018 1 SI127E-00997 49.55 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> those are the the stages the different stages that we have
SI127E-01002-P10005 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 5.09 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really interested in music it's part of my daily routine
SI127E-01002-P10005 1 SI127E-01002 5.09 8.91 <o,Q5,C,P1> i spend the whole day with background music
SI127E-01002-P10005 1 SI127E-01002 8.91 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love many styles from rock to pop reggaeton and i consider music a very important part of my life
SI127E-01002-P10006 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 3.80 <o,Q5,C,P1> i very much enjoy travelling to different places
SI127E-01002-P10006 1 SI127E-01002 3.80 9.56 <o,Q5,C,P1> in fact every year i try to travel abroad at least two times
SI127E-01002-P10006 1 SI127E-01002 9.56 19.48 <o,Q5,C,P1> every time i am on holidays i try to go abroad and i like to know new cultures meet new people
SI127E-01002-P10006 1 SI127E-01002 19.48 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i love
SI127E-01002-P10007 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 11.56 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i could choose a famous person to meet with i would choose ronaldinho which is a famous football player who played in barcelona
SI127E-01002-P10007 1 SI127E-01002 11.56 16.14 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i would choose ronaldinho because for me it has always been an awesome football player
SI127E-01002-P10007 1 SI127E-01002 16.14 19.39 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love watching him with the ball i found it incredible
SI127E-01002-P10007 1 SI127E-01002 19.39 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i would
SI127E-01002-P10008 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 12.55 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think english will help me a lot in the future because firstly it's part of my job i need to speak english almost a hundred percent of my time
SI127E-01002-P10008 1 SI127E-01002 12.55 16.20 <o,Q5,C,P1> so it's essential for me and for my job
SI127E-01002-P10008 1 SI127E-01002 16.20 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i need to have a constant improve in this level
SI127E-01002-P30017 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 23.17 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion one of the advantages of all students studying at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course is that they will get a good level in another language and this is something that will be very useful for them in the future even more if they want to go abroad or study in another country
SI127E-01002-P30017 1 SI127E-01002 23.17 40.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> however if some of these students don't want to go abroad or are not interested in languages at all maybe this matter should not this subject studying another language should not be made compulsory for them
SI127E-01002-P30017 1 SI127E-01002 40.00 44.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my opinion it's a really good idea and it is highly highly recommenable
SI127E-01002-P30017 1 SI127E-01002 44.72 50.90 <o,Q5,C,P3> my in my opinion i would suggest everyone to study the most the more languages the better
SI127E-01002-P30017 1 SI127E-01002 50.90 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> but maybe if i have to say a bad maybe it shouldn't be made compulsory for the students who are not interested in order to pass their university course
SI127E-01002-P50019 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 10.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way for students to find about international news is to read the most important newspaper in the country
SI127E-01002-P50019 1 SI127E-01002 10.71 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in spain it would be a b c or or el mundo which are really well recognized worldwide
SI127E-01002-P50020 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 2.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't agree with this statement
SI127E-01002-P50020 1 SI127E-01002 2.69 8.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that maybe they disappear physically but they won't disappear digitally
SI127E-01002-P50020 1 SI127E-01002 8.76 16.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think everyone wants to be updated about the current news so newspapers are really important for this aim
SI127E-01002-P50020 1 SI127E-01002 16.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i don't believe in their disappearance
SI127E-01002-P50021 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 10.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion social media is not very reliable because i've heard about companies that can be paid in order to influence the public opinion
SI127E-01002-P50021 1 SI127E-01002 10.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so if money can be aimed to social media in order to change the public's opinion
SI127E-01002-P50022 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 8.01 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think it's important to keep up with the local news because in the end that's where you're living
SI127E-01002-P50022 1 SI127E-01002 8.01 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so as well as being (up-) updated with news about your country you should also be updated with the news about your region
SI127E-01002-P50023 1 SI127E-01002 0.00 1.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i agree
SI127E-01002-P50023 1 SI127E-01002 1.86 9.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in fact when i read the newspaper i always see like a preference on the bad news rather than on the good news
SI127E-01002-P50023 1 SI127E-01002 9.95 11.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't like it very much
SI127E-01002-P50023 1 SI127E-01002 11.35 19.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are also even some (%hesitation%) media that only focus on the bad news
SI127E-01002-P50023 1 SI127E-01002 19.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think that's

SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 0.00 8.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> i'm going to present the crucial steps to have a successfully travel by airplane
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 8.62 13.43 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the first step is to (%hesitation%) arrive to the airport
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 13.43 20.21 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it could be by car by train and by bus it's not the most important
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 20.21 26.77 <o,Q5,B1,P4> but this the the next is to to enter to the airport
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 26.77 35.32 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you have to be check in in the in the principal service
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 35.32 48.38 <o,Q5,B1,P4> next the you have to (%hesitation%) be documented by the personnel of the control and the security have to (%hesitation%) register
SI127E-01014-P40018 1 SI127E-01014 48.38 52.38 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you have to wait in the (%hesitation%) waiting room

SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 6.08 18.75 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first you can decide your (ki-) kind of vehicle to travel to airport for example taxi bus (%hesitation%) train

SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 27.62 31.69 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you need to pass the security control
SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 31.69 37.19 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you will show your documents
SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 37.19 51.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you able to wait in some place to for example toilet restaurant
SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 51.73 53.78 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can take coffee
SI127E-01020-P40018 1 SI127E-01020 53.78 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you board into the plane and finished you take off your plane

SI127E-01023-P10007 1 SI127E-01023 17.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so it is my mother
SI127E-01023-P10008 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well in the future i like to live in new york city or maybe in spain with my mother and my father and some some pets maybe
SI127E-01023-P30017 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 15.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well first of (a-) first of all i'll be talking about (%hesitation%) advantage and disadvantage for the fitness class
SI127E-01023-P30017 1 SI127E-01023 15.14 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i mention two advantages in this topic
SI127E-01023-P30017 1 SI127E-01023 19.94 37.38 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so one of them is is (%hesitation%) fitness classes is (g-) is good for our health and it good for a good lifestyle
SI127E-01023-P30017 1 SI127E-01023 37.38 40.79 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the second it good with our bodies

SI127E-01023-P30017 1 SI127E-01023 50.09 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and my opinion it could be way this could be a good way for (im-) improve
SI127E-01023-P50019 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well i think it is most important choose a near country between (%hesitation%) living study abroad and my and their hometown because it is important stay close with your family and your friends
SI127E-01023-P50020 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it is different advantage for example it is most (%hesitation%) benefit from obtain (%hesitation%) more (po-) more more job and best job or obtain a different incentive in their job
SI127E-01023-P50021 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 6.16 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well i think that exist different disadvantage to studying in another country
SI127E-01023-P50021 1 SI127E-01023 6.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example the way to travel to point a a to point b could be a one and another point could be (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) miss the family
SI127E-01023-P50023 1 SI127E-01023 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that this sentence is true since it is a good way to (indepe-) it is a good way to become independent and more success in your job
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 0.00 4.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> now teachers thanks for attending this presentation on acid rain
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 4.95 11.71 <o,Q5,C,P4> now before i start (%hesitation%) off (%hesitation%) i want to say that factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 11.71 13.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think everybody knows that okay
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 13.45 14.80 <o,Q5,C,P4> i'll start from there
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 14.80 24.57 <o,Q5,C,P4> now once once this pollution is in the air (%hesitation%) some of these acid particles turn into smoke and this smoke is then carried by wind
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 24.57 26.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> but two things could happen
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 26.67 34.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> the first one is that some of these acid particles could fall as dust but this dust is impossible to see so i wouldn't worry about that
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 34.31 39.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> now things get worse when these particles mix with cloud water
SI127E-01035-P40018 1 SI127E-01035 39.97 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think this is this is when you need to you know take this matter seriously because some some of see some of these acid particles (%hesitation%) that this rain contains is the one that can cause the skin rash on your skin and to make things worse it damages the environment
SI127E-01042-P40018 1 SI127E-01042 0.00 15.75 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well let's talk about how was the performance of three new online pop music sites during the last week

SI127E-01043-P30017 1 SI127E-01043 0.00 17.85 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the advantage is that a student can can get of speaking foreign language to work all over the world
SI127E-01043-P30017 1 SI127E-01043 17.85 32.33 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the disadvantage is that the students need (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) more time to learn foreign language (%hesitation%) completed
SI127E-01043-P30017 1 SI127E-01043 32.33 43.07 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) all students should study (%hesitation%) at least one foreign language

SI127E-01046-P40018 1 SI127E-01046 20.84 29.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the check in is the luggage control where you just have to give the luggage to staff and they measure the weight and all that stuff

SI127E-01049-P30017 1 SI127E-01049 32.87 35.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a couple of them pop into my mind
SI127E-01049-P30017 1 SI127E-01049 35.83 52.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it could be they are less will have less time to study probably and probably will have little bit lower marks but no more
SI127E-01049-P30017 1 SI127E-01049 52.32 56.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion it should be mandatory

SI127E-01049-P40018 1 SI127E-01049 0.00 12.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so this is a (%hesitation%) path for the track that honey follows from the flowers to the shop to our table

SI127E-01049-P40018 1 SI127E-01049 18.95 30.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they transport it to their parents (%hesitation%) in beehives

SI127E-01049-P40018 1 SI127E-01049 35.74 46.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) beekeepers collect the honey from this (%hesitation%) beehives
SI127E-01049-P40018 1 SI127E-01049 46.05 54.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING

SI127E-01049-P50021 1 SI127E-01049 0.00 7.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i reckon it's the same topic it's the language
SI127E-01049-P50021 1 SI127E-01049 7.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and the language most difficult thing could be speaking and studying attending classes on on the languages second language
SI127E-01049-P50022 1 SI127E-01049 0.00 5.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the more they learn the better it would be
SI127E-01049-P50022 1 SI127E-01049 5.12 10.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they should study local culture
SI127E-01049-P50022 1 SI127E-01049 10.41 17.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is absolutely mandatory from every student that is studying abroad
SI127E-01049-P50022 1 SI127E-01049 17.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to (%hesitation%)
SI127E-01049-P50023 1 SI127E-01049 0.00 1.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> sure thing
SI127E-01049-P50023 1 SI127E-01049 1.77 3.27 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is a certain thing
SI127E-01049-P50023 1 SI127E-01049 3.27 16.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you you study you studied abroad you would can become more independent person
SI127E-01049-P50023 1 SI127E-01049 16.05 18.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to do it
SI127E-01049-P50023 1 SI127E-01049 18.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to get used
SI127E-01054-P10005 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i don't know if i am properly understanding the question but if you are talking about music i am currently not at all interested on that because i my knees are perfect working perfectly
SI127E-01054-P10006 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 4.81 <o,Q5,C,P1> i actually enjoy a lot travelling to different places
SI127E-01054-P10006 1 SI127E-01054 4.81 8.32 <o,Q5,C,P1> i like to to travel to (b-) (b-)
SI127E-01054-P10006 1 SI127E-01054 8.32 10.89 <o,Q5,C,P1> i've travelled to many countries in europe
SI127E-01054-P10006 1 SI127E-01054 10.89 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i like a lot to go camping with my family and friends
SI127E-01054-P10007 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 3.36 <o,Q4,C,P1> that is something that i have never thought about
SI127E-01054-P10007 1 SI127E-01054 3.36 15.09 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think that i wouldn't be interested in meeting any famous person probably because (%hesitation%) i am not easily driven by what others have done or by general society trends
SI127E-01054-P10007 1 SI127E-01054 15.09 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so in general i i think that i wouldn't like to meet any (per-) any famous person
SI127E-01054-P10008 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 3.21 <o,Q5,C,P1> speaking english will help me in a variety of ways
SI127E-01054-P10008 1 SI127E-01054 3.21 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> first of all it would (all-) allows me it would allows me to to enter to be enrolled in some master of science and also to (%hesitation%) access to new degrees and studies
SI127E-01054-P10008 1 SI127E-01054 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> especially it would help me to work
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 9.51 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there is at least one clear advantage of studying a foreign language in order to pass a university course course
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 9.51 22.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) this advantage is about (%hesitation%) the the the possibilities that knowing a foreign language especially english or spanish will give you in the future
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 22.81 29.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> today the world has become global in the sense that with with internet we are all connected
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 29.55 34.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it is makes no sense anymore to only know one language
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 34.39 41.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> you need to be adapted to the world and the world is dominated by chinese by english language and by spanish language
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 41.50 47.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> so these three languages should be very important for our professional and personal development
SI127E-01054-P30017 1 SI127E-01054 47.61 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage is that of course if you want to study a university course course it is not a language course so in my opinion you shouldn't force the student to study
SI127E-01054-P50019 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 8.55 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the best way for students to find out about international news would be of course to use internet
SI127E-01054-P50019 1 SI127E-01054 8.55 11.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> everyone is today connected to the internet
SI127E-01054-P50019 1 SI127E-01054 11.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and all the international news are of course posted (%hesitation%) on the websites and on centralised places for that
SI127E-01054-P50020 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> well newspapers understood as (%hesitation%) physical newspapers in paper i think that i would agree because basically today we are living a transformation in this digital era (%hesitation%) in which (%hesitation%) all the information is transferred from the papers to the internet
SI127E-01054-P50021 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 7.17 <o,Q5,C,P5> sometimes yes but in general it is not because social media is at the end like the game of the telephone
SI127E-01054-P50021 1 SI127E-01054 7.17 15.96 <o,Q5,C,P5> one people one person say something and this the next person repeat this information and repeat this information somewhere
SI127E-01054-P50021 1 SI127E-01054 15.96 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so yes sometimes is a good but there is no filter to the media
SI127E-01054-P50022 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 7.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> perhaps local news are not so important or so or so quickly changing as as international news
SI127E-01054-P50022 1 SI127E-01054 7.13 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think that it is still important because with the because of the grew because of the growing because of the (incr-) the the the increment of the number of persons in the world
SI127E-01054-P50023 1 SI127E-01054 0.00 17.05 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that when there is a lot of persons people in the in the planet on the planet is normal that there is a tendency to to focus in the on the bad news because are the are the situations the issues that produce problems
SI127E-01054-P50023 1 SI127E-01054 17.05 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i think is is true
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 0.00 9.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well first and foremost you have to (%hesitation%) travel (%hesitation%) sort of (%hesitation%) to the airport
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 9.02 15.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) that is to say you have to take the the train the bus or your car for example
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 15.75 22.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) secondly will have a check in (%hesitation%) with a person will like check your ticket
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 22.73 26.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you will have document control
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 26.15 31.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> your documents your i d i d card for example controlled
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 31.95 36.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> besides that you have to (%hesitation%) pass the security
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 36.23 44.69 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and unfortunately (%hesitation%) after all this you have to wait until your (%hesitation%) plane is ready
SI127E-01064-P40018 1 SI127E-01064 44.69 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you can (%hesitation%) finally board and the plane take off
SI127E-01065-P40018 1 SI127E-01065 0.00 6.84 <o,Q5,A2,P4> i'm going to talk about visits to three new online pot music sites
SI127E-01065-P40018 1 SI127E-01065 6.84 28.19 <o,Q5,A2,P4> in the first week the site music now had the most people than the anothers sitesp
SI127E-01065-P40018 1 SI127E-01065 28.19 50.43 <o,Q5,A2,P4> but the last day tunes net had one hundred thousands of people the most people that day
SI127E-01065-P40018 1 SI127E-01065 50.43 60.00 <o,Q5,A2,P4> another site songs for you have the minus
SI127E-01072-P10005 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 3.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i like music very much
SI127E-01072-P10005 1 SI127E-01072 3.00 7.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> like classics i like rocking roll i like (%hesitation%) popular music
SI127E-01072-P10005 1 SI127E-01072 7.68 12.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> i just not pay attention to musicians who are the latters
SI127E-01072-P10005 1 SI127E-01072 12.85 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but every time that i can i take my time to listen some music
SI127E-01072-P10006 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 12.29 <o,Q4,C,P1> i have travel for thirty different places already all over the world and a uncountable number of cities just in brazil
SI127E-01072-P10006 1 SI127E-01072 12.29 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so i would say that i enjoy travelling quite a lot and i spend something like my vacations travelling
SI127E-01072-P10007 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 8.50 <o,Q4,C,P1> i'm not sure if i'd like to meet a very (%hesitation%) known person personality
SI127E-01072-P10007 1 SI127E-01072 8.50 12.02 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) for sure i don't think i would like to meet an artist
SI127E-01072-P10007 1 SI127E-01072 12.02 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> maybe i'd like to meet ayrton senna or (%hesitation%) (man-) mandela mandela two great heroes of our
SI127E-01072-P10008 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 8.62 <o,Q4,C,P1> i expect that english will help me to find a job a good one where i can travel all over places

SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 7.84 <o,Q4,C,P3> i believe foreigner language are overvalued
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 7.84 15.73 <o,Q4,C,P3> i don't think that it all the students universal course should stud one foreign language to pass in the course
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 15.73 25.70 <o,Q4,C,P3> some (%hesitation%) students will never have to have an experience will never have to have an experience with other cultures
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 25.70 31.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> so why should they be obliges to talk a foreign language
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 31.41 41.61 <o,Q4,C,P3> and even if they do who would say that they would be speaking with this (%hesitation%) culture when they became a professional
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 41.61 49.77 <o,Q4,C,P3> this should be a point where each student should choose when the time comes
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 49.77 55.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> i believe that sometimes speaking portuguese is a waste of time
SI127E-01072-P30017 1 SI127E-01072 55.21 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> maybe mandarin would be a better fit for everyone
SI127E-01072-P50019 1 SI127E-01072 0.00 4.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i i wonder have you ever listened about internet
SI127E-01072-P50019 1 SI127E-01072 4.73 16.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can find anything at internet about international news through news through everywhere throughout everywhere and nowhere
SI127E-01072-P50019 1 SI127E-01072 16.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> just seek at the internet and make another question

SI127E-01072-P50020 1 SI127E-01072 3.54 7.42 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't read that in the future newspapers (%hesitation%) there will be no newspapers
SI127E-01072-P50020 1 SI127E-01072 7.42 13.37 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) there will be newspapers in social medias and digital medias
SI127E-01072-P50020 1 SI127E-01072 13.37 18.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it might not have newspapers in paper format

SI127E-01072-P50021 1 SI127E-01072 8.14 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) social media is one of the most corrupt way of communicating and dishonest way of communicating
SI127E-01072-P50021 1 SI127E-01072 15.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> do not get your news from social media please

SI127E-01072-P50022 1 SI127E-01072 11.19 8.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's really to find out (%hesitation%) importance of local news
SI127E-01072-P50022 1 SI127E-01072 8.02 13.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but some people like to read what's going on their neighbourhood

SI127E-01093-P10007 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'd like to meet alex ovechkin who is ice hockey player (%hesitation%) in u s a because i like playing ice hockey and he is my favourite player
SI127E-01093-P10008 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my future english help me in a business because i want to work in england so i need to communicate with other employees in english so i need to learn more (%hesitation%) in english
SI127E-01093-P30017 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 25.53 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the advantages is that (%hesitation%) learning foreign language enables students (%hesitation%) to get job easy because nowadays (%hesitation%) speak it is necessary (%hesitation%) for students (%hesitation%) to speak second language in a business
SI127E-01093-P30017 1 SI127E-01093 25.53 46.77 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the disadvantage on the other hand is that some (s-) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it is very easy for some student who has already spoken in spoken foreign language (%hesitation%) so i mean it i think that it's unfair with other students
SI127E-01093-P30017 1 SI127E-01093 46.77 54.84 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion i (a-) agree with idea because when i was high school student i took a foreign language class
SI127E-01093-P30017 1 SI127E-01093 54.84 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) it was very good time for me so i (gree-) i agree with the idea
SI127E-01093-P50019 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the best way is to use the internet because the internet enables students to catch any information about a foreign country and international news
SI127E-01093-P50020 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 9.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with that idea because nowadays (%hesitation%) we can also read newspaper online
SI127E-01093-P50020 1 SI127E-01093 9.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so in the future there will be no newspapers but we can we can read on internet and online
SI127E-01093-P50021 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 12.02 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion i don't think so because sometimes in social media there is many fake news
SI127E-01093-P50021 1 SI127E-01093 12.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so we have to think about carefully and (%hesitation%) read it (%hesitation%) carefully
SI127E-01093-P50022 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 11.48 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) listening the local news is good (%hesitation%) before traveling to other country
SI127E-01093-P50022 1 SI127E-01093 11.48 18.78 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example we can we can know the news about festval of local
SI127E-01093-P50022 1 SI127E-01093 18.78 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's
SI127E-01093-P50023 1 SI127E-01093 0.00 6.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i also think that there too much bad news
SI127E-01093-P50023 1 SI127E-01093 6.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example nowadays (%hesitation%) i often watch the news about coronavirus so it is it make me sad
SI127E-01094-P10005 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 5.92 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) i this question is a bit tricky
SI127E-01094-P10005 1 SI127E-01094 5.92 14.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have like a kind of love hate relationship with (%hesitation%) love hate relationship sorry about with (%hesitation%) music
SI127E-01094-P10005 1 SI127E-01094 14.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i think that well ok
SI127E-01094-P10006 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 8.38 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i guess that everyone's enjoys (%hesitation%) that everyone enjoys travelling to different places
SI127E-01094-P10006 1 SI127E-01094 8.38 18.40 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think you (%hesitation%) you learn many things you share also many things and you change your mind you change your perspective and you see everything
SI127E-01094-P10006 1 SI127E-01094 18.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i mean you
SI127E-01094-P10007 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 6.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my i would like to meet george orwell but of course he is dead
SI127E-01094-P10007 1 SI127E-01094 6.62 13.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but for me (%hesitation%) he made such a good satiric (%hesitation%) stories
SI127E-01094-P10007 1 SI127E-01094 13.03 15.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and for me he had like amazing ideas
SI127E-01094-P10007 1 SI127E-01094 15.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and he created words that the were words that were
SI127E-01094-P10008 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 14.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) as spanish english is a very important (%hesitation%) language and it opens you a lot in terms of in in the labour market you need lot
SI127E-01094-P10008 1 SI127E-01094 14.96 18.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> there are many people that (%hesitation%) that speak it
SI127E-01094-P10008 1 SI127E-01094 18.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think that it's a
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 13.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> i would say that (%hesitation%) learn first of all ling learning (%hesitation%) new languages (%hesitation%) is always an advantage
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 13.41 24.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> it (%hesitation%) opens a lot of labour market and but probably for some people there are some disadvantages
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 24.41 34.66 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there are some people that are not good with (%hesitation%) lang (%hesitation%) bu with sorry with languages
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 34.66 45.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> others would say that it's it shouldn't be a condition just if you want to study a foreign language you are free to do it but it not should not be compulsory
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 45.88 52.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> i i (th-) (%hesitation%) in this case i i (%hesitation%) i don't agree with that
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 52.30 57.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you know yeah and my opinion would be that you should learn a new language
SI127E-01094-P30017 1 SI127E-01094 57.53 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> yeah in order to pass
SI127E-01094-P50019 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 18.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i made (%hesitation%) a work about it i mean a work (%hesitation%) a project about it and the first thing that you have to do is of course go to the internet type international news and focus yes in the important (%hesitation%) newspapers
SI127E-01094-P50019 1 SI127E-01094 18.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean the main one
SI127E-01094-P50020 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 3.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well that's a tricky question
SI127E-01094-P50020 1 SI127E-01094 3.71 15.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that the papers will still exist but i think that most of news and all those (new-) newspapers will be online
SI127E-01094-P50020 1 SI127E-01094 15.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it will still exist (news-) newspapers but
SI127E-01094-P50021 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 6.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that's a nice question by the way but i don't think so
SI127E-01094-P50021 1 SI127E-01094 6.22 18.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to (%hesitation%) you have to take into account that social media made plenty make plenty of fake news that today are very popular
SI127E-01094-P50021 1 SI127E-01094 18.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so you have to mind that
SI127E-01094-P50022 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 8.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's crucial it's crucial for me (%hesitation%) to know what is happening around the world
SI127E-01094-P50022 1 SI127E-01094 8.43 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in for example we are going to take this coronavirus so if you don't are updated you don't know what is happening or how
SI127E-01094-P50023 1 SI127E-01094 0.00 6.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i guess that bad news is a synonym of fake news
SI127E-01094-P50023 1 SI127E-01094 6.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) and i agree with that people there are plenty of fake news nowadays that you don't know if it is true or not true if that person has said (s-) that thing or not
SI127E-01102-P10005 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 3.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm very interested in music
SI127E-01102-P10005 1 SI127E-01102 3.00 13.58 <o,Q5,C,P1> i play piano since i was four years old and love classical music but i enjoy rock and pop as many people do
SI127E-01102-P10005 1 SI127E-01102 13.58 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) and i tend to learn to play my favourite songs on piano
SI127E-01102-P10006 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 3.81 <o,Q5,C,P1> i consider myself a travelling spirit
SI127E-01102-P10006 1 SI127E-01102 3.81 11.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love to go outside to the country but also i like to visit cities with lots of history
SI127E-01102-P10006 1 SI127E-01102 11.41 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> my (%hesitation%) i tend to travel to a different part of the country at least once a year
SI127E-01102-P10007 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 3.69 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to meet tom hanks
SI127E-01102-P10007 1 SI127E-01102 3.69 6.78 <o,Q4,C,P1> i'm a fan of his movies
SI127E-01102-P10007 1 SI127E-01102 6.78 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think he's a great actor and not also that he is also a very nice person so i think it would be great to have a conversation with him
SI127E-01102-P10008 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 13.42 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) speaking english is really important to me because i want to do my medical residency in the united states where obviously i have to speak english very well to treat with patients
SI127E-01102-P10008 1 SI127E-01102 13.42 17.82 <o,Q5,C,P1> also it helps me learn a lot about music and books
SI127E-01102-P10008 1 SI127E-01102 17.82 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and
SI127E-01102-P30017 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 10.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some universities require their students to learn at least one foreign language to graduate
SI127E-01102-P30017 1 SI127E-01102 10.00 16.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think this has this have both advantages and disadvantages
SI127E-01102-P30017 1 SI127E-01102 16.63 31.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages are that every every knowledge is really useful and learning a second language (%hesitation%) opens opportunities for students
SI127E-01102-P30017 1 SI127E-01102 31.84 47.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages are that the students may not be really interested in learning a second language or may (%hesitation%) result in less time to study the area of of of study
SI127E-01102-P30017 1 SI127E-01102 47.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion i think it should be a requirement because it is needed in this global world
SI127E-01102-P50019 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 8.72 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way to get to know about international news is obviously social media
SI127E-01102-P50019 1 SI127E-01102 8.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-01102-P50020 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 12.15 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think that is going to happen because newspaper is already in a tradition in the modern (s-) society

SI127E-01102-P50021 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 2.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it really depends on the social media
SI127E-01102-P50021 1 SI127E-01102 2.97 10.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> then verified accounts like bbc world or c n n obviously are reliable
SI127E-01102-P50021 1 SI127E-01102 10.56 15.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but some fake pages and not reliable at all
SI127E-01102-P50021 1 SI127E-01102 15.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it really depends on the source and its quality
SI127E-01102-P50022 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 9.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think local news should be the main (%hesitation%) information you should get because this is about your community
SI127E-01102-P50022 1 SI127E-01102 9.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-01102-P50023 1 SI127E-01102 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) well news have to be interesting and novel so many of those things are bad things like murderers or assaults but if you look well you are going to find good news too
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so i will give a presentation (%hesitation%) about visit to three new online pop music sites
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 14.13 23.29 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so first the tune nets are getting better than others
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 23.29 36.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (f-) first day twenty thousand of people uses but finally at the last day one hundred hundred thousand of people will use
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 36.59 45.09 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and songs four you will (%hesitation%) are decreasing
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 45.09 52.44 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first day was about sixty thousand people but final day will not reach to twenty thousand people
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 52.44 55.95 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and music now (%hesitation%) keeps high range
SI127E-01103-P40018 1 SI127E-01103 55.95 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and first day seventy thousand people and
SI127E-01105-P10005 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 13.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i'm very interested in the environment because if i know about the environment and that means (%hesitation%) i'm going to be familiar with it and i really like beach or ocean
SI127E-01105-P10005 1 SI127E-01105 13.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so think i am really interested on that kind of thought
SI127E-01105-P10006 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i really like playing games with my friends because it is really exciting even if i play with myself by myself but (%hesitation%) if i play video games with my friends it's gonna be more exciting and i really like it
SI127E-01105-P10007 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 5.02 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think my mum is similar to me because she doesn't care about anything
SI127E-01105-P10007 1 SI127E-01105 5.02 11.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i don't say anything but she's she cannot to care too much
SI127E-01105-P10007 1 SI127E-01105 11.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think on that kind of point is similar to me
SI127E-01105-P10008 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i'd like to live near yokohama because i my hometown is yokohama and yokohama has a lots of beaches and i really like playing beach volleyball
SI127E-01105-P10008 1 SI127E-01105 11.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so if i lived that kind of place i can play beach volleyball and that's why i want to live there
SI127E-01105-P30017 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 16.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i think the biggest advantage is in their health because if they don't (%hesitation%) play any sport and that means it's going to be bad effect (%hesitation%) it's going to have a bad effect on their body
SI127E-01105-P30017 1 SI127E-01105 16.43 19.12 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think that is (%hesitation%) biggest advantage
SI127E-01105-P30017 1 SI127E-01105 19.12 43.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and think that the biggest disadvantage is a time because we do have to (%hesitation%) we do have to do fitness classes and that means we have to (%hesitation%) reduce the amount of our class (%hesitation%) or other class like mathematic or (%hesitation%) yeah that kind of thing
SI127E-01105-P30017 1 SI127E-01105 43.43 51.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-01105-P30017 1 SI127E-01105 51.28 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but i think that should be not too much that should not be too much
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 10.20 <o,Q5,B2,P4> ok i will (c-) (%hesitation%) i will explain how the honey will reach to the shop
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 10.20 14.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at first bees collect nectar from flowers flowers
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 14.46 19.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 19.82 23.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 23.84 30.06 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) (s-) and they have to put it in the glasses
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 30.06 34.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and there're some drivers to take it to the store
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 34.27 48.58 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and and finally (%hesitation%) the honey will be in the store and some customer will buy it and everybody is going to be happy because of it
SI127E-01105-P40018 1 SI127E-01105 48.58 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so it's really good situation
SI127E-01105-P50019 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 15.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think we should consider about (%hesitation%) the safety of the country because if it's not safety and it's gonna be dangerous and our parents will have to care of that i think that is not good
SI127E-01105-P50019 1 SI127E-01105 15.53 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think we have to care about the safety
SI127E-01105-P50020 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 10.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's really good for learning other language because (%hesitation%) if we just know about it it's nothing
SI127E-01105-P50020 1 SI127E-01105 10.35 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think we have to use it so studying in a second language is really good for learning other languages
SI127E-01105-P50021 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the most difficult thing on studying in another country it's communication because we cannot communication well because of (%hesitation%) the speaking skills so and the culture is totally different so i think we have lots of differences and difficulties
SI127E-01105-P50022 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) if we make some friends who are native in the country it's gonna be be good (%hesitation%) for learning local culture
SI127E-01105-P50023 1 SI127E-01105 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i i totally agree with what they say because we cannot rely on our parents and our friends in my country so i think going to studying abroad it's the helping (%hesitation%) becoming independent
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 0.00 19.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as as we can see is this graphic the tunes net first started with a lot little people a few people just visiting them but in the five to the to the seven day they just popped out
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 19.70 23.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> lots tons of people have visited it
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 23.16 36.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the music now online website they started with a high amount of people visit visiting and then it went insanely high
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 36.05 40.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they went little down but just a little just at the beginning
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 40.97 53.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then songs four you started in the middle not much and they went a little high for a few days but they went down so quickly
SI127E-01132-P40018 1 SI127E-01132 53.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they just didn't get any visit at the end of the week
SI127E-01137-P30017 1 SI127E-01137 0.00 16.20 <o,Q5,B1,P3> it's a double edged sword as those students have to keep in mind all the responsibilities that this involve and do a timetable for knowing how many spare time they have
SI127E-01137-P30017 1 SI127E-01137 16.20 25.54 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so in my mind i wish to recommend this in case that you will be able to hide all your own time
SI127E-01137-P30017 1 SI127E-01137 25.54 45.20 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so i think that (%hesitation%) there are plenty of advantages or disadvantages depends of (%hesitation%) your your own habits (%hesitation%) in the life and in your (%hesitation%) in your in your normal days

SI127E-01142-P40018 1 SI127E-01142 45.33 52.75 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and you need just wait maybe drink some coffee or eat some in a restaurant
SI127E-01142-P40018 1 SI127E-01142 52.75 56.17 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally you need aboard

SI127E-01161-P40018 1 SI127E-01161 5.07 11.68 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first before taking off you have to pass the check in and the document control
SI127E-01161-P40018 1 SI127E-01161 11.68 27.81 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when you passed the document control you have to pass the security control because of the (%hesitation%) policemen (%hesitation%) have to control that you don't carry any dangerous stuff
SI127E-01161-P40018 1 SI127E-01161 27.81 32.90 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) when you pass the security control you have to wait in the cafe
SI127E-01161-P40018 1 SI127E-01161 32.90 38.08 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you (ca-) you can take a coffee or you can go to the bathroom
SI127E-01161-P40018 1 SI127E-01161 38.08 44.64 <o,Q4,B1,P4> later you can board in the aeroplane and in a few minutes you take off

SI127E-01162-P40018 1 SI127E-01162 7.77 16.38 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so (%hesitation%) the first part is the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01162-P40018 1 SI127E-01162 16.38 23.50 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the second part the bees make honey from nectar in beehives

SI127E-01169-P10006 1 SI127E-01169 0.00 5.89 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well when i have free time i like to go to the gym first of all
SI127E-01169-P10006 1 SI127E-01169 5.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> sometimes i like to hang out with friends or family go to the cinema watch a good movie drink a glass of wine or just go to walk around to there and admire the nature
SI127E-01169-P10007 1 SI127E-01169 0.00 11.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the best way to improve english is watching tv series listening to podcast also reading a book
SI127E-01169-P10007 1 SI127E-01169 11.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the book i am reading currently it's doctor sleep
SI127E-01169-P10008 1 SI127E-01169 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the new skill that i would love to learn is how to read mind since it would a be very interesting to know what others thinks about me or what i am doing
SI127E-01169-P30017 1 SI127E-01169 0.00 13.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well the advantage for university students should do part time job while they are students is they can be more self dependent

SI127E-01169-P30017 1 SI127E-01169 28.35 46.19 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantage are that probably they're going to have to work probably more to pay their studies than to put the effort just in their studies
SI127E-01169-P30017 1 SI127E-01169 46.19 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's better that nowadays young adults start working because that way they can know how to get their own money

SI127E-01169-P40018 1 SI127E-01169 21.48 26.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then these acid particles are carry by the wind
SI127E-01169-P40018 1 SI127E-01169 26.79 35.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some acid particles fall as dust and then other acid particles mix with cloud water

SI127E-01226-P30017 1 SI127E-01226 22.27 24.59 <o,Q4,C,P3> that's one of the main advantages
SI127E-01226-P30017 1 SI127E-01226 24.59 37.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> the other advantage is that they will have the level that is required to enter different (%hesitation%) occupations or job so they will have more opportunities to have a good (%hesitation%) job

SI127E-01226-P50019 1 SI127E-01226 0.00 9.88 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion the best way for students to get to know about international news is to rely on websites
SI127E-01226-P50019 1 SI127E-01226 9.88 16.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example you can use the b b c website to get information on international news

SI127E-01226-P50020 1 SI127E-01226 0.00 11.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> from my perspective newspapers will exist as long as there is people interested in getting to know what's happening in the world
SI127E-01226-P50020 1 SI127E-01226 11.62 17.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i do not agree that (%hesitation%) newspapers will disappear

SI127E-01284-P50020 1 SI127E-01284 0.00 6.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in the past face to face with the teacher learning is the best option

SI127E-01284-P50022 1 SI127E-01284 0.00 7.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinions attending lectures alone is not better than reading alone
SI127E-01284-P50022 1 SI127E-01284 7.17 11.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we need to do both attending lecture and reading alone
SI127E-01284-P50022 1 SI127E-01284 11.79 18.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> after that we still need to do the practicing all the time in order to make it perfect
SI127E-01284-P50022 1 SI127E-01284 18.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> otherwise whatever you learn
SI127E-01284-P50023 1 SI127E-01284 0.00 7.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is very importance for the university to provide modern learning facilities
SI127E-01284-P50023 1 SI127E-01284 7.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there is a lot of learning facilities such as internet of things data analysis software and digital economy and many thing more and more are coming and coming soon
SI127E-01293-P30017 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 24.48 <o,Q5,B1,P3> well (%hesitation%) schools definitely has time for (%hesitation%) students to do fitness classes because the advantage of do fitness classes is that you provide to the students (%hesitation%) a class to to get distracted from some (s-) stuff school stuffs
SI127E-01293-P30017 1 SI127E-01293 24.48 37.57 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and also doing exercise in the school you can (%hesitation%) get more energy and you can be focused on in specific topics
SI127E-01293-P30017 1 SI127E-01293 37.57 49.38 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and the disadvantages is that probably (%hesitation%) some students (%hesitation%) can't do fitness classes because their (%hesitation%) personal (%hesitation%) health
SI127E-01293-P30017 1 SI127E-01293 49.38 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) but in my opinion it's an excellent idea (%hesitation%) have some fitness classes in in the school for all the students
SI127E-01293-P40018 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 1.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> ok
SI127E-01293-P40018 1 SI127E-01293 1.91 9.38 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in this chart in this image we can see (h-) how is the the production of (%hesitation%) honey
SI127E-01293-P40018 1 SI127E-01293 9.38 25.38 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so first (%hesitation%) we know that (%hesitation%) bees collect the nectar from flowers and then they go to they they they homes and make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI127E-01293-P40018 1 SI127E-01293 25.38 52.17 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then when they make the honey (%hesitation%) some keepers bee keeper beekeepers (%hesitation%) collect the honey in different (%hesitation%) tars and in these tars are full of honey and then they are transporting to a supermarket where they are selling to the general (%hesitation%) (pu-) (pu-) public
SI127E-01293-P40018 1 SI127E-01293 52.17 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and yeah
SI127E-01293-P50019 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 15.31 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the most important to consider first when there are choicing a country to study in is (%hesitation%) the languages and also the the food culture that that country has
SI127E-01293-P50019 1 SI127E-01293 15.31 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and also the
SI127E-01293-P50020 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well the advantages of studying a second language is that you can improve that languages and (als-) in speaking and in your listening because you will improve that areas in that languages
SI127E-01293-P50021 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 14.17 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the most diffcult for studying in another country is it will be (%hesitation%) that you are far from your family and your your family support will be different
SI127E-01293-P50021 1 SI127E-01293 14.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and also because you need to deal with different people that has different (cul-) (%hesitation%) (t-)
SI127E-01293-P50022 1 SI127E-01293 0.00 15.17 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well students (%hesitation%) can learn about the local culture (%hesitation%) by dealing with people that is native of that place
SI127E-01293-P50022 1 SI127E-01293 15.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and also they learn about the food and the place

SI127E-01312-P10008 1 SI127E-01312 17.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so that provides me that
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 0.00 7.09 <o,Q5,B1,P3> it is a well known fact that nowadays the students have to study for a foreign language (%hesitation%) in order to pass their university course
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 7.09 22.01 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think it's good because (%hesitation%) that's the the it's good the the university to encourage students to study a second language because that will (%hesitation%) provides them a better job opportunities (%hesitation%) and they will improve their cv
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 22.01 31.63 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but there's also sin some disadvantages because that (%hesitation%) there because there are some careers for instance there are some careers we don't they don't really need to use a foreign language
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 31.63 41.48 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example (%hesitation%) i t students who really doesn't need to study another language because they will just know their english current (s-) (%hesitation%) language
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 41.48 57.64 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so (%hesitation%) in my opinion (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) this law should have to be (%hesitation%) attend in order to should be (%hesitation%) more flexible and trying to understand which are the subjects which really need to have that foreign language
SI127E-01312-P30017 1 SI127E-01312 57.64 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for instance the language the (%hesitation%)

SI127E-01312-P50020 1 SI127E-01312 0.00 18.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah i totally agree with that statement because (%hesitation%) the (fut-) the future newspapers will i (gue-) i i think they will be online because it's the future they will they (w-) these (w-) because they will provoke this would provoke a reduce on paper which we are nowadays wasting quite a lot
SI127E-01312-P50020 1 SI127E-01312 18.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and also because these papers

SI127E-01312-P50023 1 SI127E-01312 12.87 18.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but the point is that media (pr-) (pr-) it prefers to have some impressionist news
SI127E-01312-P50023 1 SI127E-01312 18.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and if they

SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 8.84 13.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first thing you need to do is go to the airport
SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 13.87 26.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the airport you (f-) should first check in the counter and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) drop (%hesitation%) drop some luggage if you need to
SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 26.84 33.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you need to went through document control and security
SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 33.22 42.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) after that you should just wait (%hesitation%) before the arrival time comes
SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 42.02 49.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) after the arrival time comes you can board the airplane
SI127E-01314-P40018 1 SI127E-01314 49.80 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) finally you can take off and (%hesitation%) start the air travel
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 0.00 15.95 <o,Q4,B1,P4> ok when you're going to have an (%hesitation%) an airplane travel you might need to have your passport and (%hesitation%) visa updated before to buy an ticket for airplane
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 15.95 24.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when you have it that you need to (ra-) to do your check in in online or you can do it in the airport
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 24.14 29.46 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (be-) before you having the check in you have the document controlling
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 29.46 39.11 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the document control they they check your your visa and your maybe your passport to pass into the security check up
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 39.11 55.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then is then in in this part they check if you don't have the you have the all of the your stuff in the in your baggage (%hesitation%) without something that can hurt some people or something like that
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 55.04 57.88 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then wait to work the airplane
SI127E-01357-P40018 1 SI127E-01357 57.88 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> in this case is also you need to
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 0.00 12.98 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well to travel by airplane you first need to find a way to get to the airport
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 12.98 17.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> once you are on the airport you need to do the check in
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 17.60 29.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the check in means that if you have luggage you (ha-) you have to give your luggage to the company that you have in which you have bought the the tickets the flight tickets
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 29.66 37.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to go to document control and you have to (%hesitation%) show your i d or passport
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 37.05 41.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and during the security they are going to check that you don't have liquids or weapons
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 41.99 51.67 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you will wait maybe thirty minutes maybe two hours until (%hesitation%) they announce the boarding
SI127E-01358-P40018 1 SI127E-01358 51.67 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you go (t-) into the plane and go to wherever you want
SI127E-01370-P10005 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 11.02 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my opinion i am very interested in insec because i feel very comfortable with this
SI127E-01370-P10005 1 SI127E-01370 11.02 20.97 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and sometimes it's very hard but i feel very fine
SI127E-01370-P10006 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 6.83 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i really enjoy travelling to different places
SI127E-01370-P10006 1 SI127E-01370 6.83 20.97 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my opinion travel to another parts is one of the most important things for the humans because you have a better vision of the life
SI127E-01370-P10007 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 20.97 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my opinion i don't have a famous person i don't have a favourite famous person but i would like meet maybe a famous like (le-) leonardo dicaprio or something like that or maybe a businessman
SI127E-01370-P10008 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 18.55 <o,Q5,B1,P1> speak english it will help me to obtain my degree because in my university is necessary learn english if i want be a businessman in the future
SI127E-01370-P10008 1 SI127E-01370 18.55 20.97 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so it's very necessary
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 15.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion all the students need least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 15.41 18.37 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think we have different advantage
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 18.37 28.25 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of the most important advantage is that all the students can communicate and talk with people from other countries
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 28.25 36.13 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and it's very important if they want have a better life
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 36.13 48.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think more one of the disadvantage are it could can concentrate very well in another (%hesitation%) subjects
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 48.46 57.28 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion it's very helpful to apply for a new job outside of this country
SI127E-01370-P30017 1 SI127E-01370 57.28 60.35 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so it's very helpful stop
SI127E-01370-P50019 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 15.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the most important (%hesitation%) way to see the international news is in facebook and all the social media
SI127E-01370-P50019 1 SI127E-01370 15.13 21.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think these kind of technologies have a lot of (internatio-)
SI127E-01370-P50020 1 SI127E-01370 0.00 8.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the future of the newspapers is on internet
SI127E-01370-P50020 1 SI127E-01370 8.18 17.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in the future internet it will be the most important way to communicate news

SI127E-01450-P50022 1 SI127E-01450 0.00 13.91 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) they provide you information relevant information about how is (%hesitation%) how is happening in your country
SI127E-01450-P50022 1 SI127E-01450 13.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so i think that is very important to be aware of the news and the problems that your city can
SI127E-01450-P50023 1 SI127E-01450 0.00 18.95 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that that there are there are lot of bad news and fake news then can produce you a big confusion in your head and have the incorrect knowledge about some things
SI127E-01450-P50023 1 SI127E-01450 18.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so you have to be
SI127E-01496-P30017 1 SI127E-01496 0.00 11.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> ok guys although in some countries (%hesitation%) this new programme has been introduced in many other countries (%hesitation%) there's been talks in order to hammer out an agreement
SI127E-01496-P30017 1 SI127E-01496 11.66 23.23 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the point here is that once when when undergraduates (%hesitation%) are about to you know to finish their degree they need to pass a language course
SI127E-01496-P30017 1 SI127E-01496 23.23 43.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and one of the advantages of passing a course is that because you'll be or you have been studying the language that doesn't mean that you you didn't you didn't learn anything that means that (%hesitation%) now you have a new appreciation of the of the culture of a of a new culture of a new way of living and so on
SI127E-01496-P30017 1 SI127E-01496 43.66 51.44 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but one of the disadvantages is that some students don't like languages so they end up wasting their time yeah
SI127E-01496-P30017 1 SI127E-01496 51.44 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my own opinion i think this is the perfect opportunity to expand your knowledge as well as (%hesitation%) you know
SI127E-01525-P10005 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 6.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to say that i am so interested in music but in fact i am not
SI127E-01525-P10005 1 SI127E-01525 6.72 9.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> not because i don't really like it
SI127E-01525-P10005 1 SI127E-01525 9.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's mostly because i don't have time to be interested in such things as music because i have many work to do with other
SI127E-01525-P10006 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 7.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm not gone i'm not going to lie i enjoy travelling to different places so much
SI127E-01525-P10006 1 SI127E-01525 7.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is such an stunning an stunning situation to live in (%hesitation%) just by look into other cultures and eating their food it's incredible
SI127E-01525-P10007 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> thor from the avengers film is the famous person i would like to meet undoubtedly only because he really looks like me or in fact i look like him and i really like their (f-) his films
SI127E-01525-P10008 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 4.19 <o,Q4,B2,P1> speaking english is gonna help me a lot in the future
SI127E-01525-P10008 1 SI127E-01525 4.19 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as i want to be an international consultant manager i need to speak not only english but also another languages fluently and this is something i need to practice and will be very helpful for me
SI127E-01525-P30017 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 23.48 <o,Q5,B2,P3> okay so on the one hand a benefit of students studying at least one foreign language could be that they will be able to talk to people from this country we (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) with their language
SI127E-01525-P30017 1 SI127E-01525 23.48 32.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> another good point could be the fact that they will have a better curriculum vitae in compare to other students
SI127E-01525-P30017 1 SI127E-01525 32.59 44.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other (ha-) on the other side a negative effect will be that they will have less time to spend for other things such as (%hesitation%) enjoying life
SI127E-01525-P30017 1 SI127E-01525 44.30 54.91 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) a (nega-) another negative effect could be the fact that they will have less time to study other courses
SI127E-01525-P30017 1 SI127E-01525 54.91 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> my final opinion is that it is a good thing to study a foreign language
SI127E-01525-P50019 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> honestly speaking the best way to for students to find about international news is going through the internet trying to search new websites which talk about international news of course or trying to get into foreign (%hesitation%) newspapers
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 2.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i disagree with that
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 2.50 6.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the newspapers are gonna adapt to the future
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 6.76 9.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think they are going to disappear
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 9.53 16.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and with adapt i mean that they will become online newspapers as it is happening right now
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 16.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this could be a reason of not disappearing
SI127E-01525-P50021 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 7.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean there is undoubtedly an increasing trend toward the use of social media
SI127E-01525-P50021 1 SI127E-01525 7.17 13.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if it is a good thing or a bad thing i don't really know i don't have all the information
SI127E-01525-P50021 1 SI127E-01525 13.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if you ask me i will tend to think that it is better much than worse
SI127E-01525-P50022 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 12.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is crucial to keep with the (in-) local news as you need to know what is happening right before you right behind you
SI127E-01525-P50022 1 SI127E-01525 12.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you don't know about it how do you expect to know what is happening in the international way
SI127E-01525-P50023 1 SI127E-01525 0.00 8.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> honestly speaking i think kindly the same as those people
SI127E-01525-P50023 1 SI127E-01525 8.27 16.90 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but it it is just because bad news are the ones who we're who we are interested in
SI127E-01525-P50023 1 SI127E-01525 16.90 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we are not interesting in seeing good news
SI127E-01557-P30017 1 SI127E-01557 0.00 17.49 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the greats advantage if you study a foreign language to pass your university course it is very simple because you have got more experience for your future work
SI127E-01557-P30017 1 SI127E-01557 17.49 27.46 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and another advantage it's is (%hesitation%) you have you can speak with more people
SI127E-01557-P30017 1 SI127E-01557 27.46 43.08 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the great disvantage if you study in university you don't time well you don't have time to study another language because you spend all your time in your subjects of the university
SI127E-01557-P30017 1 SI127E-01557 43.08 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion it's very useful study other language when you're study in the university but you spend more time in your studies
SI127E-01557-P50019 1 SI127E-01557 0.00 14.28 <o,Q5,A2,P5> the best way for a student to understand the international news is the internet (be-) because you find all the news in internet
SI127E-01557-P50019 1 SI127E-01557 14.28 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it's very easy for the students
SI127E-01557-P50023 1 SI127E-01557 0.00 12.28 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think that the bad news is very important too because you know all the type of news the goods and the bads
SI127E-01557-P50023 1 SI127E-01557 12.28 20.11 <o,Q5,A2,P5> because you life in this world and in this world you can found all
SI127E-01571-P10005 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 6.34 <o,Q4,C,P1> for me music is the best way to (%hesitation%) express yourself and your feelings
SI127E-01571-P10005 1 SI127E-01571 6.34 9.05 <o,Q4,C,P1> that's why music is very important for me
SI127E-01571-P10005 1 SI127E-01571 9.05 16.77 <o,Q4,C,P1> music can raise someone's mood can get them excited can make them feel a calm and relax
SI127E-01571-P10005 1 SI127E-01571 16.77 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> that's why (%hesitation%) i think that the way
SI127E-01571-P10006 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 7.95 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think that travelling is the best way to know to learn more about yourself
SI127E-01571-P10006 1 SI127E-01571 7.95 20.11 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) travelling (%hesitation%) is offering a set of opportunities for us every day as to meet a lot of people to see a lot of places to escape

SI127E-01571-P10008 1 SI127E-01571 13.19 18.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> that's why (%hesitation%) people who are working around the area should speak english
SI127E-01571-P10008 1 SI127E-01571 18.64 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it will advance my career
SI127E-01571-P30017 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 12.34 <o,Q5,C,P3> studying a foreign language in order to pass the university course (%hesitation%) will open a set of opportunities for the students students
SI127E-01571-P30017 1 SI127E-01571 12.34 31.17 <o,Q5,C,P3> at (%hesitation%) for example (%hesitation%) students knowing (%hesitation%) other foreign language can go to study abroad or (%hesitation%) to find a job (%hesitation%) which can help them to advance their career
SI127E-01571-P30017 1 SI127E-01571 31.17 42.63 <o,Q5,C,P3> also (%hesitation%) the disadvantage of (%hesitation%) learning the foreign language is that the amount of studying is increasing
SI127E-01571-P30017 1 SI127E-01571 42.63 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i mean that (%hesitation%) there (i-) there are there is a lot of information (%hesitation%) for students to learn and it's in addiction they will have to learn a foreign language
SI127E-01571-P50019 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think students can find out more information on the international web pages and maybe (%hesitation%) on the pages of the most important national
SI127E-01571-P50019 1 SI127E-01571 15.50 20.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> newspapers and also (%hesitation%) by watching videos in
SI127E-01571-P50020 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 10.45 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) the newspapers will exist in the future but (%hesitation%) on the internet online

SI127E-01571-P50021 1 SI127E-01571 3.91 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and maybe for if it's (%hesitation%) normal news about the daily life it's better to learn an article in a magazine or even to watch the
SI127E-01571-P50022 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think first of all we need to be up to date with the local news instead of the international or or country news because (%hesitation%) the most important things you need to know are on the local basis not international
SI127E-01571-P50023 1 SI127E-01571 0.00 1.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think so
SI127E-01571-P50023 1 SI127E-01571 1.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of good news (%hesitation%) right now in the on the newspapers and on the news on tv because the government is trying to reduce the amount of the bad news (%hesitation%) for their public

SI127E-01579-P10005 1 SI127E-01579 7.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but about learning the history of music or how music is made is not one of my hobbies or my or interests

SI127E-01579-P10008 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well english is the number one language speaken in all of the world so it is very important for your job and when you are travelling to other countries to know english so you can communicate and ask for the things you need
SI127E-01579-P30017 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 21.94 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i think it is important for students to learn a foreign language because this can give them some experience about another country or their cultural customs and it can look good on a on your cv that you have learned another language
SI127E-01579-P30017 1 SI127E-01579 21.94 37.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the disadvantages is that some students don't like to learn foreign language that are okay with what they know and this may cause (%hesitation%) unnecessary stress on them (%hesitation%) you don't want stress the students
SI127E-01579-P30017 1 SI127E-01579 37.66 44.19 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion i think a student should choose if they want to study a foreign language
SI127E-01579-P30017 1 SI127E-01579 44.19 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it should not be mandatory to avoid any more stress on them
SI127E-01579-P50019 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the best way to find about international news is on social media or in the newspapers
SI127E-01579-P50020 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 12.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i do agree that in the future there will be no newspaper because having a paper that you are going only read once and then you are going to throw away is very harmful for the environment
SI127E-01579-P50020 1 SI127E-01579 12.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think a more eco friendly way to do to have a newspaper is online
SI127E-01579-P50021 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 12.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think social media is never a reliable source of news because people post there whatever they like even though sometimes (%hesitation%) the there are lies and sometimes they are true
SI127E-01579-P50021 1 SI127E-01579 12.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should always check the sources and always verify that what people are saying

SI127E-01579-P50022 1 SI127E-01579 14.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is very important to keep with your local news
SI127E-01579-P50023 1 SI127E-01579 0.00 8.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well on the current situation of course there are lots of bad news and i don't think you should see them as the negative thing
SI127E-01579-P50023 1 SI127E-01579 8.63 17.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should be concerned about why are these all bad news always on the on media or always happening
SI127E-01579-P50023 1 SI127E-01579 17.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that is the right question here

SI127E-01783-P50019 1 SI127E-01783 12.33 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but also you can (%hesitation%) look for the newspapers of each country maybe on internet
SI127E-01783-P50020 1 SI127E-01783 0.00 14.38 <o,Q4,C,P5> well actually i don't agree because i know that a lot of people prefers to read the newspaper on the internet (%hesitation%) on the computer but many other people prefers to do it like in a more traditional way
SI127E-01783-P50020 1 SI127E-01783 14.38 16.65 <o,Q4,C,P5> i mean the in the newspaper
SI127E-01783-P50020 1 SI127E-01783 16.65 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and most of their like the
SI127E-01783-P50021 1 SI127E-01783 0.00 18.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> i will say that it's not at all a reliable (%hesitation%) source of news because you can find a lot of fake news (%hesitation%) on the internet and especially in social media because many people can write whatever they want in that part
SI127E-01783-P50021 1 SI127E-01783 18.61 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so you can never
SI127E-01783-P50022 1 SI127E-01783 0.00 5.97 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i think it's pretty important because at the end of the day it's the place where you live
SI127E-01783-P50022 1 SI127E-01783 5.97 13.39 <o,Q4,C,P5> so (%hesitation%) i think it's pretty important to be aware of your local news as well as the international or and national news
SI127E-01783-P50022 1 SI127E-01783 13.39 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but the place where you live is the most important because the decisions are very important
SI127E-01783-P50023 1 SI127E-01783 0.00 13.50 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think its true because sometimes you're watching the tv and the tv news and the only thing that you can see and you can watch it's like bad news and and people dying and diseases
SI127E-01783-P50023 1 SI127E-01783 13.50 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and sometimes we need to see like more positive things and i think it's pretty important to do that

SI127E-01800-P30017 1 SI127E-01800 42.33 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> at at the finally my opinion (%hesitation%) i think that it's important that the universities or (%hesitation%) or or schools (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) offer the free courses a confidence to help the students to to improve their their languages

SI127E-01800-P50020 1 SI127E-01800 12.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and i think that it's more (%hesitation%) more comfortable too for the the society
SI127E-01800-P50021 1 SI127E-01800 0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes in my mind (%hesitation%) social media will become one of the most important way to to communicate
SI127E-01800-P50021 1 SI127E-01800 10.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) and i think that the young people use more and more (%hesitation%)
SI127E-01809-P10005 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 3.20 <o,Q5,C,P1> i cannot live without music
SI127E-01809-P10005 1 SI127E-01809 3.20 19.25 <o,Q5,C,P1> i listen to music every day in every moment when i have to go to work as i work as a research (%hesitation%) in the laboratory i'm always with my headphones listening to music
SI127E-01809-P10005 1 SI127E-01809 19.25 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> it helps
SI127E-01809-P10006 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 9.14 <o,Q5,C,P1> that is probably the best thing that i the the thing i love most travelling
SI127E-01809-P10006 1 SI127E-01809 9.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i love travelling around
SI127E-01809-P10007 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 13.16 <o,Q5,C,P1> since the fact that i love technology so much i would really really really love to know (%hesitation%) bill gates in person
SI127E-01809-P10007 1 SI127E-01809 13.16 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> that would be one of my most epic days in my life
SI127E-01809-P10007 1 SI127E-01809 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so bill gates would be there
SI127E-01809-P10008 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 6.24 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think speaking english will help me in a lot of ways
SI127E-01809-P10008 1 SI127E-01809 6.24 10.38 <o,Q5,C,P1> first academically with my career
SI127E-01809-P10008 1 SI127E-01809 10.38 16.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am a p h d student so i have to read a lot of it in english
SI127E-01809-P10008 1 SI127E-01809 16.29 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> then going to congresses and
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 13.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> i believe there is a whole raft of arguments in favour of learning a foreign language to pass their university course
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 13.37 26.96 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think it is really important for you to get to know a different language so you can travel the world and learn different cultures get and immerse in different cultures
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 26.96 34.80 <o,Q5,C,P3> plus you probably can find a job somewhere else where they do not speak the same language as you do
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 34.80 45.05 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main disadvantage may be probably that it takes time to learn a different language
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 45.05 57.77 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my point of view i think it is really necessary to give it a shot and learn a different language and get out of our comfort zone
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 57.77 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so
SI127E-01809-P50019 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 15.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> every day technology grows more and more in the world and develops more so i think that the best way for kids to get international news is by the internet
SI127E-01809-P50019 1 SI127E-01809 15.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they are always using their phones their computers
SI127E-01809-P50020 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 3.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm not sure about that
SI127E-01809-P50020 1 SI127E-01809 3.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean i think it's a highly probability that newspapers would disappear due to the fact that everybody is reading the news by computers right now
SI127E-01809-P50021 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 11.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i tend to believe that social media is not always a trustable source of news
SI127E-01809-P50021 1 SI127E-01809 11.43 18.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> sometimes when you get into accounts like certified accounts from newspapers yeah
SI127E-01809-P50021 1 SI127E-01809 18.73 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if
SI127E-01809-P50022 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 17.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i feel as if local news disappear probably people from little towns would not notice about what things are happening in their places
SI127E-01809-P50022 1 SI127E-01809 17.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> just because they live in a
SI127E-01809-P50023 1 SI127E-01809 0.00 8.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i fully agree with that because we are surrounded by bad notice
SI127E-01809-P50023 1 SI127E-01809 8.09 17.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well you can tell two thousand and twenty was one of the worst years i've ever lived
SI127E-01809-P50023 1 SI127E-01809 17.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but yeah
SI127E-01856-P10005 1 SI127E-01856 0.00 12.28 <o,Q3,C,P1> well since i am a huge fan of paul mccartney and the beatles music (%hesitation%) i would say (%hesitation%) i'm keen on listening to music every single day or in and every single minute in my life
SI127E-01856-P10005 1 SI127E-01856 12.28 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P1> even though (%hesitation%) at times i need to focus on my work on my let's say personal activities but in the end
SI127E-01856-P10006 1 SI127E-01856 0.00 5.59 <o,Q3,C,P1> well people say i tend to get itchy feet every time i go on vacation and then that's true
SI127E-01856-P10006 1 SI127E-01856 5.59 18.27 <o,Q3,C,P1> i meant if if i have worked all year long and i haven't had enough breaks i think this is the perfect time for me to you know to (%hesitation%) to pack all my necessary stuff
SI127E-01856-P10006 1 SI127E-01856 18.27 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P1> and as
SI127E-01856-P10007 1 SI127E-01856 0.00 13.59 <o,Q3,C,P1> well given the choices i will probably say paul mccartney or even john lennon but that would depend on the budget on whether i will be able to you know to get to know them in person
SI127E-01856-P10007 1 SI127E-01856 13.59 20.00 <o,Q3,C,P1> but in the end (%hesitation%) if i well if i was about to meet a person
SI127E-01856-P10008 1 SI127E-01856 0.00 2.72 <o,Q3,C,P1> well i would say it's already helping me

SI127E-01884-P30017 1 SI127E-01884 20.61 30.91 <o,Q5,B1,P3> one advantage is going to have the skill of communication and the way to communicate with other people around the world in another language
SI127E-01884-P30017 1 SI127E-01884 30.91 44.88 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the disadvantage is that maybe if you are in college you are going to (ma-) to waste your time (o-) because maybe you have the time very collapses
SI127E-01884-P30017 1 SI127E-01884 44.88 54.70 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so although you're going to use that time to another thing maybe for study and have better grades and do not disconcentrate of this thing
SI127E-01884-P30017 1 SI127E-01884 54.70 57.62 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion is a good thing
SI127E-01884-P30017 1 SI127E-01884 57.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but it isn't going to be

SI127E-01884-P50020 1 SI127E-01884 0.00 11.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah of course i agree with you because it seems to me that in the future they will disappear the (new-) the old newspaper with the old ideas
SI127E-01884-P50020 1 SI127E-01884 11.48 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so in the (f-) the future will be with new innovating newspaper that it will do in a

SI127E-01884-P50022 1 SI127E-01884 0.00 10.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well keep it local news is a very important way to know about what is happening to round your environment
SI127E-01884-P50022 1 SI127E-01884 10.68 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you must have to know what is happening through your city and through your sources so you can
SI127E-01884-P50023 1 SI127E-01884 0.00 11.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i think this (%hesitation%) there are a lot of bad news in the media because are the things that are sell more and this an important thing
SI127E-01884-P50023 1 SI127E-01884 11.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the newspapers sell want money and the bad news gets them money
SI127E-01897-P10005 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 16.98 <o,Q4,C,P1> i can't say that a keen music fan but i tend to listen from musics to music from time to time especially (%hesitation%) when i am doing some housework or when i am running or cycling
SI127E-01897-P10005 1 SI127E-01897 16.98 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> music makes me feel inspired and full of
SI127E-01897-P10006 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 3.58 <o,Q5,C,P1> in fact i'm fond of travelling
SI127E-01897-P10006 1 SI127E-01897 3.58 11.06 <o,Q5,C,P1> i've visited several countries already and (%hesitation%) i'm really looking forward to visiting more
SI127E-01897-P10006 1 SI127E-01897 11.06 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think travelling is a great chance to to open the world (%hesitation%) to experience local culture
SI127E-01897-P10007 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 4.60 <o,Q4,C,P1> to be to be honest i've never thought about it so it's difficult to say
SI127E-01897-P10007 1 SI127E-01897 4.60 6.26 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) let me think
SI127E-01897-P10007 1 SI127E-01897 6.26 11.91 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) probably i would like to meet madonna one day
SI127E-01897-P10007 1 SI127E-01897 11.91 14.33 <o,Q4,C,P1> she's such an extraordinary person
SI127E-01897-P10007 1 SI127E-01897 14.33 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) she is a singer at the same time she is a business woman so
SI127E-01897-P10008 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 8.97 <o,Q5,C,P1> i believe that il it will help my (%hesitation%) job my main occupation since i am an english teacher
SI127E-01897-P10008 1 SI127E-01897 8.97 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) at the same time it will enable me to communicate with people better while travelling abroad
SI127E-01897-P10008 1 SI127E-01897 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and sometimes i like reading
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 4.06 <o,Q4,C,P3> that's quite a controversial question
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 4.06 14.08 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i think it depends on (%hesitation%) on a subjects subject that (%hesitation%) student have chosen
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 14.08 27.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) if (%hesitation%) their main study is related to (%hesitation%) linguistics or learning some languages i think that's vital (%hesitation%) to study at least one foreign language in order to pass
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 27.88 44.34 <o,Q4,C,P3> but when their studying is not related to any linguistic or any kind of that things (%hesitation%) when they are more like (%hesitation%) focused on math chemistry and biology i don't think that's vital
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 44.34 53.77 <o,Q4,C,P3> however it's really it i think it's vitally important to master at least one foreign language (%hesitation%) for your future life
SI127E-01897-P30017 1 SI127E-01897 53.77 60.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in that case students will get more job opportunities
SI127E-01897-P50019 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the best alternative is to follow the latest updates for example different newspapers especially electronic ones (%hesitation%) as well as (%hesitation%) following some (%hesitation%) i don't know tv news and to stay up to date to keep the pace
SI127E-01897-P50020 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 2.22 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i quite agree on that
SI127E-01897-P50020 1 SI127E-01897 2.22 8.24 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think that newspapers will ever (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) became become extinct
SI127E-01897-P50020 1 SI127E-01897 8.24 14.42 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think (%hesitation%) they will turn to be (%hesitation%) in a kind of electronic version
SI127E-01897-P50020 1 SI127E-01897 14.42 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think they will ever die out (%hesitation%) since they are like a sort
SI127E-01897-P50021 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 0.24 <o,Q5,C,P5> (t-)
SI127E-01897-P50021 1 SI127E-01897 0.24 10.97 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think they are a really reliable source source of information coz people usually tend to post some i don't know funny and entertaining videos
SI127E-01897-P50021 1 SI127E-01897 10.97 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> they do not carry real (%hesitation%) like know (l-) life (%hesitation%) necessary (%hesitation%) situations (%hesitation%)
SI127E-01897-P50022 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 8.46 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) of the same importance as keeping up to date with news in general news all over the world
SI127E-01897-P50022 1 SI127E-01897 8.46 18.24 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's really crucial to to keep up with (%hesitation%) the events which going in your area
SI127E-01897-P50022 1 SI127E-01897 18.24 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> yeah
SI127E-01897-P50023 1 SI127E-01897 0.00 1.43 <o,Q5,C,P5> so you nailed it
SI127E-01897-P50023 1 SI127E-01897 1.43 10.48 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah there are lots of really terrible news describing accidents car crashes i don't know some illnesses diseases
SI127E-01897-P50023 1 SI127E-01897 10.48 16.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's so (%hesitation%) it's so disaffecting to watch all this news
SI127E-01897-P50023 1 SI127E-01897 16.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would like to see and to listen to more positive (ne-)

SI127E-01902-P10006 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my free time i spend most of my time (t-) on watching the movies and dramas on (%hesitation%) on (%hesitation%) netflix
SI127E-01902-P10007 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 8.76 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think the best way to improve my english skills is speaking or talking with foreign countries
SI127E-01902-P10007 1 SI127E-01902 8.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-01902-P10008 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 7.78 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it it would be (%hesitation%) english business speaking skills
SI127E-01902-P10008 1 SI127E-01902 7.78 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> that's because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i when i work i have to speak with foreign peoples
SI127E-01902-P40018 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 17.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> many vehicles and factories emit (%hesitation%) air particles and (%hesitation%) this these air particles rise up into the air by window
SI127E-01902-P40018 1 SI127E-01902 17.27 35.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of them are fall as dust to the land but other acid particles mix with cloud water and they they rain or snow and be down to the land

SI127E-01902-P40018 1 SI127E-01902 41.17 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is how acid rain has a bad effect to our natural environment
SI127E-01902-P50019 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 14.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i recommend them recommend to them that (w-) they should have only three times eating (%hesitation%) breakfast lunch dinner

SI127E-01902-P50020 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 5.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> drinking a lot of water is good to our health
SI127E-01902-P50020 1 SI127E-01902 5.60 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is that's because drinking a lot of water can enable us to detox the bad things from our body
SI127E-01902-P50021 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 5.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes doing exercise is very good to our health
SI127E-01902-P50021 1 SI127E-01902 5.61 13.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) i disagree we should do exercise every day
SI127E-01902-P50021 1 SI127E-01902 13.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that because (%hesitation%) we are very busy every day so we don't have enough time to do so
SI127E-01902-P50022 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 14.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i need to sleep for eight or more hours but the time to need to sleep varies from person to person
SI127E-01902-P50022 1 SI127E-01902 14.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so eight hours' sleeping it isn't must to have condition
SI127E-01902-P50023 1 SI127E-01902 0.00 4.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology has a bad effect on our lives
SI127E-01902-P50023 1 SI127E-01902 4.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that because technology can enable us to have a (b-) comfortable life that we don't have to do some tasks (%hesitation%) by ourselves
SI127E-01903-P10005 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 8.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i like listen to music when i am studying or i am (%hesitation%) working

SI127E-01903-P10006 1 SI127E-01903 13.89 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) for example i like travelling roma or paris
SI127E-01903-P10007 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 11.01 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i could like meet a writer who is called danielle steel because she is my favorite writer
SI127E-01903-P10007 1 SI127E-01903 11.01 15.15 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in fact i have read all her books
SI127E-01903-P10007 1 SI127E-01903 15.15 17.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is fantastic
SI127E-01903-P10007 1 SI127E-01903 17.10 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) this is very romantic

SI127E-01903-P10008 1 SI127E-01903 4.23 10.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but actually it's more and more difficult find a job if you don't have a good qualification
SI127E-01903-P10008 1 SI127E-01903 10.96 17.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if i had a good in level of english i could find a good job in a future
SI127E-01903-P10008 1 SI127E-01903 17.63 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is very important for me in my opinion
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 17.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well (%hesitation%) study a foreign language (%hesitation%) is a big advantage today because if you if you want find a good job you will (%hesitation%) have to good qualification
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 17.13 26.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so if you know a foreign language it's a a good advantage for for you
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 26.49 40.34 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) actually (%hesitation%) most company (%hesitation%) ask (%hesitation%) for (%hesitation%) a foreign language when you apply for (%hesitation%) a new job
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 40.34 44.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's very important today know about this
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 44.05 52.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) maybe it's difficult for you study a foreign language but it's very important today
SI127E-01903-P30017 1 SI127E-01903 52.68 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's necessary all student have (%hesitation%) a grasp for foreign language
SI127E-01903-P50019 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 18.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) from my point of view the west way could be (%hesitation%) on internet or maybe (%hesitation%) international channel on tv is is a good way because you can (%hesitation%) hear the news in other country
SI127E-01903-P50019 1 SI127E-01903 18.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's very important that
SI127E-01903-P50020 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 14.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion that is possible because currently all people use the computer or the tv (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) no no use (%hesitation%) no use the newspaper actuality
SI127E-01903-P50020 1 SI127E-01903 14.48 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so maybe in the future (%hesitation%) disappoint the the newspaper
SI127E-01903-P50021 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 13.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion we have to be careful with the social media because (%hesitation%) not all will say the true
SI127E-01903-P50021 1 SI127E-01903 13.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) maybe if the social media is about a channel like b b c
SI127E-01903-P50022 1 SI127E-01903 0.00 18.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as far as i'm concerned in bes it's very important (%hesitation%) to know about local new because i think (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) we we have to know about what happening in our city and in the world
SI127E-01903-P50022 1 SI127E-01903 18.77 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important that

SI127E-01933-P10007 1 SI127E-01933 15.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i love her songs and i wanted to ask
SI127E-01933-P10008 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am sure that speaking english would help me a lot in the future because nowadays we live in a globalized world and you need to know english in order to speak with your colleagues in another countries for example if you work in a in a multinational company
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 9.28 <o,Q4,C,P3> some people (%hesitation%) think that students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 9.28 12.63 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there are some advantages and some disadvantages
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 12.63 24.89 <o,Q4,C,P3> for example one of the advantages is that (%hesitation%) students will have better career opportunities if they know more languages because that is something that (%hesitation%) companies (%hesitation%) value a lot
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 24.89 27.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand there are some disadvantages
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 27.71 46.39 <o,Q4,C,P3> for example that requirement can cause inequality within the students because those from well off families (%hesitation%) have more opportunities to pay for an academy in order to improve their english (proficien-) (%hesitation%) english language proficiency for example
SI127E-01933-P30017 1 SI127E-01933 46.39 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion it is a good idea but the university has to offer help to (%hesitation%) his students in order to (%hesitation%) assure that all of them have the same opportunities
SI127E-01933-P50019 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 8.44 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) as we live in a globalized world (%hesitation%) students have the international news just by one touch of the hand
SI127E-01933-P50019 1 SI127E-01933 8.44 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) they can (%hesitation%) they can find this information in in internet and they can just browsing the web they will find all the information they may need about (some-)
SI127E-01933-P50020 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 11.77 <o,Q4,C,P5> some people may think that because of the digitalization (%hesitation%) more and more people are using (%hesitation%) their laptops for example in order to browse (%hesitation%) news
SI127E-01933-P50020 1 SI127E-01933 11.77 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> or (%hesitation%) however (%hesitation%) there are still many people that prefer to read the newspaper in
SI127E-01933-P50021 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 6.55 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion social media is not a (re-) a reliable source of news
SI127E-01933-P50021 1 SI127E-01933 6.55 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) it has (%hesitation%) its positive and negative aspects but for me (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) there are a lot of fake news that spread up in the web and can cause disinformation
SI127E-01933-P50022 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 8.23 <o,Q4,C,P5> for me my opinion it's very important to keep up with (%hesitation%) local news because it's the place where you live
SI127E-01933-P50022 1 SI127E-01933 8.23 17.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> and for me i think it's important to be inform about what is happening near to you (%hesitation%) because you living in that environment
SI127E-01933-P50022 1 SI127E-01933 17.62 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and you have to be aware of what
SI127E-01933-P50023 1 SI127E-01933 0.00 11.70 <o,Q4,C,P5> i completely agree with that because (%hesitation%) it seems when you watch for example the news on the tv it seems that everything that is happening in the world is negative
SI127E-01933-P50023 1 SI127E-01933 11.70 18.42 <o,Q4,C,P5> and they don't usually talk about (%hesitation%) something positive or in a positive way
SI127E-01933-P50023 1 SI127E-01933 18.42 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's always
SI127E-01941-P10005 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 9.38 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i really love music and i love a lot of different kinds of music like (%hesitation%) rock music pop music
SI127E-01941-P10005 1 SI127E-01941 9.38 18.54 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but the most (%hesitation%) music i love is rap music because i think in some rap music they can show some social issues in there
SI127E-01941-P10005 1 SI127E-01941 18.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and we can
SI127E-01941-P10006 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 1.60 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i really love it
SI127E-01941-P10006 1 SI127E-01941 1.60 4.53 <o,Q5,B1,P1> because in the future i will study abroad
SI127E-01941-P10006 1 SI127E-01941 4.53 10.04 <o,Q5,B1,P1> that means i need to know more details about other country like cultures and customs
SI127E-01941-P10006 1 SI127E-01941 10.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and that means trips can helps me to know more details on the on cultures and customs and also can make me be independent
SI127E-01941-P10007 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 4.60 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i really want to see my idol (%hesitation%) mico in the future

SI127E-01941-P10007 1 SI127E-01941 14.59 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and mico is a professional organ player and i really want to know him
SI127E-01941-P10008 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 5.41 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) as we know english is the most popular language in this world
SI127E-01941-P10008 1 SI127E-01941 5.41 13.63 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so i think if i really good at (%hesitation%) english in the future i can find some jobs just like translator
SI127E-01941-P10008 1 SI127E-01941 13.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) except that (%hesitation%) i also get much more opportunities to find a good jobs
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 7.25 <o,Q5,B1,P3> as we know students will be required to know a foreign language to pass their course
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 7.25 14.98 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so for the advantages those foreign language can help students to get more opportunities to find a job
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 14.98 19.19 <o,Q5,B1,P3> that means you can be a translator or something just like this
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 19.19 27.78 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and also you will have much more knowledge about the (%hesitation%) foreign cultures and customs
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 27.78 30.80 <o,Q5,B1,P3> that means you can make some foreign friends
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 30.80 46.62 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) obvious obviously for the disadvantage for some really unpopular language (%hesitation%) i think there was no (%hesitation%) too much chance for you for to use it in the future
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 46.62 51.84 <o,Q5,B1,P3> that means (%hesitation%) you are not really important to know this kind of language
SI127E-01941-P30017 1 SI127E-01941 51.84 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and for me if i choosing some really popular language (li-) just like (%hesitation%) english so i will (%hesitation%) keep on it
SI127E-01941-P50019 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 5.88 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think they can use the cell phone and website for searching the international news
SI127E-01941-P50019 1 SI127E-01941 5.88 11.34 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and they need to using the authoritative website like google and bings
SI127E-01941-P50019 1 SI127E-01941 11.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) in those website they can just find the (%hesitation%) real news for the other countries
SI127E-01941-P50020 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 4.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think it depends on what types of country you live in
SI127E-01941-P50020 1 SI127E-01941 4.04 10.29 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so if you are in develop developed country that means your internet is really developed
SI127E-01941-P50020 1 SI127E-01941 10.29 14.88 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and maybe (%hesitation%) in few years ago there will new no newspaper
SI127E-01941-P50020 1 SI127E-01941 14.88 18.69 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but if you in some developing country there is no internet
SI127E-01941-P50020 1 SI127E-01941 18.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> we need newspaper
SI127E-01941-P50021 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 11.59 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the most social media news are fake (%hesitation%) because for some peoples (%hesitation%) using the fake news to attract (%hesitation%) everyone's mind
SI127E-01941-P50021 1 SI127E-01941 11.59 16.16 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and they can use this kind of way to make a lot of money
SI127E-01941-P50021 1 SI127E-01941 16.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and that makes (%hesitation%) social media a fake
SI127E-01941-P50022 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 7.29 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's really important because (%hesitation%) everyone live in this country need to know something happens around him
SI127E-01941-P50022 1 SI127E-01941 7.29 11.82 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and they need to know the news and real things
SI127E-01941-P50022 1 SI127E-01941 11.82 19.10 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so if the newspaper can tell them (%hesitation%) some bad things and they can pay attention to those things
SI127E-01941-P50022 1 SI127E-01941 19.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and help them
SI127E-01941-P50023 1 SI127E-01941 0.00 7.59 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the bad news is equal to the good news because that all is real things happens around us
SI127E-01941-P50023 1 SI127E-01941 7.59 16.20 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and that means if you only know the good news it's will makes you (%hesitation%) so relax in everydaily life

SI128D-00007-P10007 1 SI128D-00007 0.00 15.49 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the best way in my point of view is learning like talking with native people coz they have all that that you need

SI12BD-00067-P30017 1 SI12BD-00067 8.16 22.17 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) nowadays students have to do part time jobs to (%hesitation%) fulfil the requirements like (%hesitation%) paying the university or (%hesitation%) (t-) college fees

SI12BD-00067-P50020 1 SI12BD-00067 10.41 18.81 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and our body is mostly made with water so water is a very main source of our body
SI12BD-00067-P50020 1 SI12BD-00067 18.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so drink to

SI12BD-00067-P50021 1 SI12BD-00067 18.75 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so
SI12BD-00067-P50022 1 SI12BD-00067 0.00 15.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is true to (%hesitation%) fulfil your sleep at least for seven to eight hours because healthy sleeping is a a way to live healthy life
SI12BD-00067-P50022 1 SI12BD-00067 15.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it is very important
SI12BD-00067-P50023 1 SI12BD-00067 0.00 13.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> actually i think any (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) thing use (%hesitation%) excessively is (%hesitation%) negative impact of everybody
SI12BD-00067-P50023 1 SI12BD-00067 13.25 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but do you apply the thing in the right way so it is very useful
SI12BD-00086-P40018 1 SI12BD-00086 0.00 14.69 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) today i want to talk about how honey is made by bees from flower and how honey is made by bees from flower to shop
SI12BD-00086-P40018 1 SI12BD-00086 14.69 23.71 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so every morning bees will collect nectar from flowers so and then they will bring back to their (h-) to their beehives
SI12BD-00086-P40018 1 SI12BD-00086 23.71 26.84 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so bees will make honey from nectar in their beehives
SI12BD-00086-P40018 1 SI12BD-00086 26.84 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) a few days after that beekeepers will collect honey from beehives and and they will put it in the bottle and pack it properly and then they will send it to the shop by van
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 0.00 1.82 <o,Q4,B1,P4> ok let's start
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 1.82 5.82 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so today's (%hesitation%) how honeys is proceduce
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 5.82 11.96 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so first (%hesitation%) bees collect (%hesitation%) nectar from flowers
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 11.96 13.41 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this is the first stage
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 13.41 18.98 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and second stage bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 18.98 25.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) beekeepers collect the honey from beehive bee honeys

SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 33.81 37.65 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and finally (%hesitation%) in shops are honeys
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 37.65 42.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) we can buy in shop this honey
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 42.70 49.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> but this (%hesitation%) (s-) stage on the process it's so long
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 49.91 54.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and bee is very important
SI12BD-00090-P40018 1 SI12BD-00090 54.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so it is very fantastic

SI12BD-00187-P10008 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 16.98 <o,Q4,B1,P1> first it give me a chance to communicate with english speaking people (%hesitation%) because there are many people speaking english in the world so i i think this is a chance for me to communicate with most people in the world
SI12BD-00187-P10008 1 SI12BD-00187 16.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and also it can help me to know more

SI12BD-00187-P30017 1 SI12BD-00187 21.72 36.62 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but the disadvantage is that i think might there are some people who really don't want to learn a new language and they don't have this ability to learn the other language so (%hesitation%) so quickly
SI12BD-00187-P30017 1 SI12BD-00187 36.62 40.56 <o,Q3,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) so maybe it's not very good for them
SI12BD-00187-P30017 1 SI12BD-00187 40.56 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> my own is that it's not a must for students to study at least one foreign language in order to pass the course because they're (%hesitation%) they really don't need to regard this as (%hesitation%) necessary
SI12BD-00187-P50019 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 16.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way is to (%hesitation%) watch the tv because every night the news (%hesitation%) the news program will not only report the your country but also the whole world
SI12BD-00187-P50019 1 SI12BD-00187 16.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and in this way you can learn about much international
SI12BD-00187-P50020 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 16.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i don't (ag-) agree because i think the newspaper has its own advantages like people can (%hesitation%) (ma-) many old people like to read the newspapers and they don't get used to (%hesitation%) reading news on the phone
SI12BD-00187-P50020 1 SI12BD-00187 16.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it can it will not be
SI12BD-00187-P50021 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 15.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's not all reliable because some social media might to (%hesitation%) make some fake news to (%hesitation%) attract people
SI12BD-00187-P50021 1 SI12BD-00187 15.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so people should distinguish between real and (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00187-P50022 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 15.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) the local news can let us to learn about the things around us and also deepen our understanding of our own own own country our own problems
SI12BD-00187-P50022 1 SI12BD-00187 15.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is important to do it
SI12BD-00187-P50023 1 SI12BD-00187 0.00 7.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the reason of (%hesitation%) of that there are many bad news is that the bad news can attract more people
SI12BD-00187-P50023 1 SI12BD-00187 7.54 14.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so the media might report more bad news but actually there is many good things
SI12BD-00187-P50023 1 SI12BD-00187 14.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think maybe bad news (%hesitation%) is not what they
SI12BD-00344-P10005 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 5.79 <o,Q5,B1,P1> many times music (%hesitation%) reflects your personal character in each time
SI12BD-00344-P10005 1 SI12BD-00344 5.79 13.54 <o,Q5,B1,P1> you can show many rhythms that you can involve your your feelings
SI12BD-00344-P10005 1 SI12BD-00344 13.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) music many times reflects your feeling about it

SI12BD-00344-P10007 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 8.65 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like to meet with michael jordan because he's the the goat great of all times
SI12BD-00344-P10007 1 SI12BD-00344 8.65 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) he's the reason to starting a one sports like basketball since i was four years old
SI12BD-00344-P10008 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i will speak english at the future with my computer because (%hesitation%) many many people of my family don't have any knowledge about that i want to share and i want to to search
SI12BD-00344-P30017 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 14.93 <o,Q5,B1,P3> one of the most advantage that all students (%hesitation%) (st-) (%hesitation%) study one foreign language in order to pass the university course increase (th-) his knowledge around his lifestyle
SI12BD-00344-P30017 1 SI12BD-00344 14.93 35.95 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) but one of the more disadvantage is to share all of them in each language because (%hesitation%) each language (%hesitation%) has some difference between the meaning of that although you can discover the same meaning in each language
SI12BD-00344-P30017 1 SI12BD-00344 35.95 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so in my opinion i reflect that (%hesitation%) this reaction because i prefer to stay to evolve my mater language and after to (com-) complimate with a foreign language but not with the same level like mater language
SI12BD-00344-P50019 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> one of the best way to find international news is download several apps that you can catch by phone or you can see (%hesitation%) international news by laptop or (e-) what technology that you can
SI12BD-00344-P50020 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 1.84 <o,Q5,B1,P5> that's a question and a half
SI12BD-00344-P50020 1 SI12BD-00344 1.84 16.55 <o,Q5,B1,P5> on deception the newspapers can't be (%hesitation%) sold by people it will be an increasing of the future of newspapers
SI12BD-00344-P50020 1 SI12BD-00344 16.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> is is this could be the best way
SI12BD-00344-P50021 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> social media is not a reliable source (%hesitation%) social news because many times reflect fake news for example (%hesitation%) football players that reflects a lot of fans reflects on a fake news
SI12BD-00344-P50022 1 SI12BD-00344 0.00 14.57 <o,Q5,B1,P5> since it has began the epidemic around this country the import of a local news increasing (%hesitation%) a lot by people they could return to his house
SI12BD-00344-P50022 1 SI12BD-00344 14.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) this is the unique way to know (ha-) what happen around the country
SI12BD-00362-P10005 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 8.15 <o,Q3,B1,P1> i'm quite interested in music especially i like listening to japanese pop music
SI12BD-00362-P10005 1 SI12BD-00362 8.15 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P1> so when i use public transportation i often listen to music
SI12BD-00362-P10008 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 11.15 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i will be able to speak english fluently it's really helpful for me because i would like to be pilot

SI12BD-00362-P10008 1 SI12BD-00362 16.82 18.56 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i think so too
SI12BD-00362-P10008 1 SI12BD-00362 18.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so that why
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 9.83 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think advantage point is that they can take another language skill as a second language
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362 9.83 22.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> on the other hand (disadv-) disadvantage point it's that there are some student who doesn't want to study foreign language or who doesn't need to study language in order to pass the university
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362 22.00 28.77 <o,Q3,B1,P3> but in my opinion they should learn about foreign language
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362 28.77 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> but i think also this
SI12BD-00362-P50019 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 14.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that using smartphone is the best way to find out international news because modern society smartphone is the most used technology
SI12BD-00362-P50019 1 SI12BD-00362 14.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so many people is using smartphone and they can study national news
SI12BD-00362-P50020 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 14.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree that there's no there will be no newspaper in the future because maybe in the future we don't need to read newspaper because of the smartphone
SI12BD-00362-P50020 1 SI12BD-00362 14.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think newspaper lead to damage the environment
SI12BD-00362-P50021 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 17.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i don't think social media is a reliable source of news because even though social media is very useful in our society social media is included a lot of suspicious news
SI12BD-00362-P50021 1 SI12BD-00362 17.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we have to consider about
SI12BD-00362-P50022 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 16.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it very important to keep up to date of local news because there's some news which we shouldn't forgot like many people passed away or many people injured like this
SI12BD-00362-P50022 1 SI12BD-00362 16.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> like this news we shouldn't forget
SI12BD-00362-P50023 1 SI12BD-00362 0.00 19.01 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think depend on just such time because if it happen a lot of bad news bad things the newspaper company and (%hesitation%) news media have to contribute to know let people know bad news
SI12BD-00362-P50023 1 SI12BD-00362 19.01 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that why
SI12BD-00388-P10005 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 13.55 <o,Q4,B2,P1> interesting interested in environment because i think each one of us should play a part (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) just a little to help the environment that we are living on
SI12BD-00388-P10005 1 SI12BD-00388 13.55 16.99 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we should worry about the climate change
SI12BD-00388-P10005 1 SI12BD-00388 16.99 17.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> okay
SI12BD-00388-P10005 1 SI12BD-00388 17.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's my opinion
SI12BD-00388-P10006 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 15.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so me and my friends (%hesitation%) we enjoy to hang out and together to drinks beers (%hesitation%) at late nights (%hesitation%) music shows and parties
SI12BD-00388-P10006 1 SI12BD-00388 15.58 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we all i think we all like it
SI12BD-00388-P10007 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 9.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am most similar to my dad because i did (%hesitation%) stay with him in a few years
SI12BD-00388-P10007 1 SI12BD-00388 9.87 14.47 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think i learn a (f-) a lot of things with him
SI12BD-00388-P10007 1 SI12BD-00388 14.47 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think he's the most important person (%hesitation%) of my family
SI12BD-00388-P10008 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 17.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to live in lisbon to work in lisbon to buy a house and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) grow up together with my family (%hesitation%) and with my friends (%hesitation%) and marry my girlfriend
SI12BD-00388-P10008 1 SI12BD-00388 17.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i think is the (%hesitation%) my
SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 12.68 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so schools and college and college should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness class
SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 12.68 24.45 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some (ad-) advantage are that (%hesitation%) to combat (%hesitation%) obesity
SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 24.45 34.10 <o,Q5,B1,P3> this is very important because childrens nowadays they are very very big
SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 34.10 45.38 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some disadvantage is is that some people don't will like to do some fitness class

SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 47.74 57.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> my opinion i think that every college have to (p-) have a fitness class like in the morning
SI12BD-00388-P30017 1 SI12BD-00388 57.23 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) so when the students (arri-)

SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 7.37 11.08 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the diagram shows how honey is produce
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 11.08 15.52 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so it is begin by the bees
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 15.52 17.32 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the bees begin every day
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 17.32 35.80 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so (sh-) they the bees collect nectar from the flowers and they put in this nectar in the beehives that make the honey
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 35.80 50.58 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so after this the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives and put the in the glass in (th-) in this glasses
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 50.58 56.69 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after they put in the glasses they gonna put they gonna sell
SI12BD-00388-P40018 1 SI12BD-00388 56.69 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (s-) but first they can go
SI12BD-00388-P50019 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the the first thing they have to choose when choosing (%hesitation%) a country is that if the country is security if they are good house to live if the plan of study it's good for them
SI12BD-00388-P50020 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 5.45 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's very good if you studying in a second language

SI12BD-00388-P50020 1 SI12BD-00388 12.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> if you learn how to speak spanish french portuguese it's amazing
SI12BD-00388-P50021 1 SI12BD-00388 0.00 6.73 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so some difficult of studying in another country is like they are alone
SI12BD-00388-P50021 1 SI12BD-00388 6.73 8.93 <o,Q5,B1,P5> they don't have parents

SI12BD-00388-P50021 1 SI12BD-00388 11.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> they have to impress themselves and go to the world and don't be afraid of the

SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450 2.38 10.48 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one of the advantage of study a language is that it will help you for your for future job

SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450 17.59 30.97 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) however on the other hand one of the disadvantage of study a language during university is that you have less free time to study
SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450 30.97 35.28 <o,Q4,B1,P3> many students has problem learning a new language
SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450 35.28 42.73 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in my opinion i can say that is very important to study another language

SI12BD-00568-P10005 1 SI12BD-00568 13.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we have to reduce the (greenhou-) (ga-) greenhouse gases and pollution

SI12BD-00568-P30017 1 SI12BD-00568 18.52 22.99 <o,Q5,B1,P3> you will have improve your skills

SI12BD-00568-P30017 1 SI12BD-00568 28.74 38.72 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and i don't have i don't think that fitness classes are disadvantages
SI12BD-00568-P30017 1 SI12BD-00568 38.72 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> my opinion is that if you have the opportunity to do exercise do it because you will feel better with yourself and it's necessary for your health and your body
SI12BD-00568-P40018 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 10.56 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in fact there is a movie that will will probably explain it better than me but i am going to try
SI12BD-00568-P40018 1 SI12BD-00568 10.56 27.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first the honey bees collect nectar from flowers and then they bees make honey from nectar in (beha-) in their panels
SI12BD-00568-P40018 1 SI12BD-00568 27.91 39.97 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put them honey on bottles
SI12BD-00568-P40018 1 SI12BD-00568 39.97 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then will give you to the supermarket and will place in it in order to you can have honey for your breakfast or whatever you want
SI12BD-00568-P50019 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 17.07 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that they consider if the country has good weather good food and if the place is near to their home
SI12BD-00568-P50019 1 SI12BD-00568 17.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that is
SI12BD-00568-P50020 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 8.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) if you learn a second language (i-) language you will have more opportunities in laboral life
SI12BD-00568-P50020 1 SI12BD-00568 8.46 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P5> you will get a better job and you will will visited more countries
SI12BD-00568-P50021 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 16.23 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the most difficult to a student that go to another country to study it's their culture and get used to it
SI12BD-00568-P50021 1 SI12BD-00568 16.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so yeah i think that is most difficult
SI12BD-00568-P50022 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 16.06 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the best way obviously is spend time with the new classmates and have friends from that place that country
SI12BD-00568-P50022 1 SI12BD-00568 16.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> they will show you all
SI12BD-00568-P50023 1 SI12BD-00568 0.00 2.10 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that's true
SI12BD-00568-P50023 1 SI12BD-00568 2.10 16.61 <o,Q5,B1,P5> if you go out of your country and stay so so long from your family it gives you more independent and (ma-) gives you another point of view of life
SI12BD-00568-P50023 1 SI12BD-00568 16.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and gets you more

SI12BD-00657-P10006 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 13.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy a lot travelling to different places because i learn different cultures and i meet new people so i learn a lot with this this kind of experience
SI12BD-00657-P10006 1 SI12BD-00657 13.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think that when this situation change i will go out and will have a
SI12BD-00657-P10007 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 18.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) if i have the chance to meet a famous person i would meet cristian ronaldo because i think that is a professional football player that represents (m-) my values and the way that i face the life
SI12BD-00657-P10007 1 SI12BD-00657 18.69 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> no
SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 6.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well so i think that english knowledge it's really important
SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657 6.14 17.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) knowing how to speak english would open us a lot of doors at the market
SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657 17.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it's really important
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 8.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantage is the professional development
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 8.60 8.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> no
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 8.99 16.42 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because nowadays companies want professionals with very competitive curriculums
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 16.42 32.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so if we have a good level at different languages we will have more open doors than the others than (%hesitation%) study (%hesitation%) foreign language
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 32.05 48.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the main disadvantage is that in most of cases at university people live in a very busy style with a lot of works with a lot of exam so it could affect to their marks
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 48.22 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that if you are able to study a different language and if you have time you must do it
SI12BD-00657-P50019 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 14.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that social media is the best way to knew about international news because all of the most important video channels of the world have a profile on it

SI12BD-00657-P50020 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 3.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with that but in part
SI12BD-00657-P50020 1 SI12BD-00657 3.88 15.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that there won't be physical newspapers but online (f-) (%hesitation%) newspapers are a reality nowadays
SI12BD-00657-P50020 1 SI12BD-00657 15.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think that this tendence is going to keep on
SI12BD-00657-P50021 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that social media is a reliable source because you can argue your posts with (%hesitation%) image and videos to give more credibility to your speech
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657 0.00 17.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that local news are the most (im-) the most important for us because (%hesitation%) we we need to know what's happening near us to know what is going to happen at the future and what is going to happen on the world
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657 17.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 1.86 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i love music
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 1.86 11.63 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that is my passion and is the most important thing for me because in the future maybe i will be a musician
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 11.63 15.25 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i can play the piano and the guitar
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 15.25 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> and really is my passion music
SI12BD-00665-P10006 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> travel is my favourite thing in the world because if you want to know different places you (ca-) you need to travel around the country
SI12BD-00665-P10007 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> obviously i would like to know justin bieber because is my favouritest pop star and is so handsome and i think that your lyrics are very (%hesitation%) consistent efficient
SI12BD-00665-P10008 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in the future if you if i learn and speak english maybe will be a interesting person and i will have a lot of opportunities in the world because is an skill that you can to do (every-)
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 7.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> currently speaking a language other than yours is of almost importance
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 7.05 12.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> at universities students must meet a certain level of english to graduate
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 12.54 24.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first the advantage of knowing another language are getting better job opportunities meeting people for the other countries and being able to communicate with them
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 24.80 35.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> learn about the culture of other countries is one it's another one advantage for this skill
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 35.84 43.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantage are that it is very exhausting to learn another language because you have to study a lot
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 43.84 55.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion learn another language is a way to open new horizons in your work life and it also helps you understand other cultures cultures excuse me
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 55.74 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it's a very
SI12BD-00665-P50019 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me the social media is a good way to find out information about international news because a long part of the day the people are connecting with your smartphone or your laptop i dunno to know
SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think that's the case because newspapers are (tra-) traditional means of communication specially for older people
SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665 10.04 15.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i believe that social media provides immediately information
SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665 15.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and this is increasing now and in the next (ye-)
SI12BD-00665-P50022 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> it's important to know what happens in your state or your country which you live because that can be from about the weather the economy of the country and and other important issues situation now in your daily (li-)
SI12BD-00665-P50023 1 SI12BD-00665 0.00 3.71 <o,Q3,B2,P5> it seems to indicate that is true
SI12BD-00665-P50023 1 SI12BD-00665 3.71 6.96 <o,Q3,B2,P5> bad news in the media is a very serious problem
SI12BD-00665-P50023 1 SI12BD-00665 6.96 14.38 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i think it's something that should change maybe in the next years
SI12BD-00665-P50023 1 SI12BD-00665 14.38 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> that is why it's important that you continue reading the newspaper because it's a true (co-)
SI12BD-00691-P10005 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 2.57 <o,Q5,C,P1> guess i like music
SI12BD-00691-P10005 1 SI12BD-00691 2.57 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P1> but i don't think i'm that interested in it because i don't produce or i don't (%hesitation%) play (%hesitation%) any instrument
SI12BD-00691-P10005 1 SI12BD-00691 11.61 13.15 <o,Q5,C,P1> i just consume music
SI12BD-00691-P10005 1 SI12BD-00691 13.15 14.80 <o,Q5,C,P1> i just listen to it
SI12BD-00691-P10005 1 SI12BD-00691 14.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i like it but i'm not such a big fan
SI12BD-00691-P10006 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 6.45 <o,Q5,C,P1> (avelling-) actually is my biggest hobby and is what i enjoy the most
SI12BD-00691-P10006 1 SI12BD-00691 6.45 14.47 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i when i travel i feel free and i forget every problem i have in my home country
SI12BD-00691-P10006 1 SI12BD-00691 14.47 17.32 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i is what i enjoy the most definitely
SI12BD-00691-P10006 1 SI12BD-00691 17.32 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so yes i love travelling
SI12BD-00691-P10007 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 10.49 <o,Q5,C,P1> guess i will like to meet ed sheeran because i love (%hesitation%) his music and i think is my i would say that is my favourite singer
SI12BD-00691-P10007 1 SI12BD-00691 10.49 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) yeah i (%hesitation%) he seems like a nice person and i will like i would like to meet him
SI12BD-00691-P10008 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 4.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> (ink-) it will help me for everything because i study international relations
SI12BD-00691-P10008 1 SI12BD-00691 4.29 9.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i need english and not only english (al-) also (o-) (o-) other languages
SI12BD-00691-P10008 1 SI12BD-00691 9.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> learning english will help me (%hesitation%) with my with my job (%hesitation%) and also when i study also when i have to will have to communicate with other people
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 24.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> on one hand i think it will be essential to learn a foreign language to pass your university course because (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) you're gonna need it for your future career (%hesitation%) in order to have a an (%hesitation%) an employment in that in the in any area that in in which you wanna work
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 24.21 35.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> because nowadays all human resources responsibles (%hesitation%) ask for a english title or a french title or something like that
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 35.75 44.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i think the disadvantage of this on the other hand is that it's gonna take time from your from your course
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 44.15 56.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you're gonna have to spend time studying a language (%hesitation%) that it adds to the time you're spending (%hesitation%) learning your your courses
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 56.58 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion this is essential
SI12BD-00691-P50019 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> say the best way to find out to find out international news is searching online in internet or (m-) maybe following the the (for-) foreign (%hesitation%) foreign news outlets from other countries in twitter or (f-)
SI12BD-00691-P50020 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 3.18 <o,Q5,C,P5> no i don't agree with that prediction
SI12BD-00691-P50020 1 SI12BD-00691 3.18 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think we will we will leave that transformation of journalism and instead of having (%hesitation%) (n-) (n-) paper newspapers (%hesitation%) we will have (%hesitation%) online newspapers
SI12BD-00691-P50020 1 SI12BD-00691 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and (tho-) that's gonna be the way we (gon-)
SI12BD-00691-P50021 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 11.96 <o,Q5,C,P5> well this is controversial because some people say is not a reliable source source of news at all because of the fake news (%hesitation%) we can have there
SI12BD-00691-P50021 1 SI12BD-00691 11.96 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but if you follow the news outlets like that are (%hesitation%) prestigious you wouldn't have any problem
SI12BD-00691-P50022 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 18.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my own personal view (%hesitation%) i don't think it's that important to be up to date (%hesitation%) on local news because now (%hesitation%) (wi-) the with the globalisation everything (%hesitation%) that happens (%hesitation%) in another part of the world can affect you
SI12BD-00691-P50022 1 SI12BD-00691 18.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i think world news
SI12BD-00691-P50023 1 SI12BD-00691 0.00 3.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah i totally agree with that statement
SI12BD-00691-P50023 1 SI12BD-00691 3.26 5.74 <o,Q5,C,P5> we have a lot of bad news in the media
SI12BD-00691-P50023 1 SI12BD-00691 5.74 18.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i think the problem is that bad news (%hesitation%) are more (%hesitation%) maybe sensationalist to people and they consume more bad news than good news
SI12BD-00691-P50023 1 SI12BD-00691 18.16 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and that's why newspapers
SI12BD-00783-P10005 1 SI12BD-00783 0.00 6.20 <o,Q5,B2,P1> university i i'm mad about music specifically pop music

SI12BD-00783-P10005 1 SI12BD-00783 10.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i i really love them because their lyrics are very attractive and they say i lot with this
SI12BD-00783-P10006 1 SI12BD-00783 0.00 6.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and that's why i like travelling to different places but only if you have the money to do it
SI12BD-00783-P10006 1 SI12BD-00783 6.58 18.14 <o,Q5,B2,P1> travelling means (%hesitation%) spending (%hesitation%) big (%hesitation%) amounts of your own money that you (%hesitation%) put lots of efforts to earn
SI12BD-00783-P10006 1 SI12BD-00783 18.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and therefore i
SI12BD-00783-P10007 1 SI12BD-00783 0.00 4.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like to if i could choose i'd probably meet johnny depp
SI12BD-00783-P10007 1 SI12BD-00783 4.70 7.33 <o,Q5,B2,P1> he's an incredible actor

SI12BD-00783-P10008 1 SI12BD-00783 1.17 8.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> speaking english will help me (%hesitation%) in a few years with my with getting a job probably

SI12BD-00783-P10008 1 SI12BD-00783 19.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> therefore
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 0.00 18.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the one hand the main advantage of (%hesitation%) studying a foreign language in order to pass the your university course is that (%hesitation%) this requirement is going to improve your cv and is gonna help you in the future in the job market
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 18.77 22.94 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand the (disa-) disadvantage that is time
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 22.94 37.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if you work sorry if you study while (%hesitation%) practicing a language a language a language and you have to pass some exams this means that you are going to need to spend a lot of a lot of time doing this
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 37.21 37.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> right
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 37.92 54.84 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) therefore (%hesitation%) as far as i am concerned the advantages of the advantage of this overcomes the the main disadvantage and therefore i recommend you to (%hesitation%) to make foreign language as a requirement (%hesitation%) at university
SI12BD-00783-P30017 1 SI12BD-00783 54.84 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) that's because i think this is the best way to

SI12BD-00783-P50019 1 SI12BD-00783 1.16 5.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the best way to access international news is online

SI12BD-00783-P50020 1 SI12BD-00783 2.40 17.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i believe that newspapers are going to exist for many years from now (%hesitation%) due to them the enormous amount of people who read who still read newspapers nowadays

SI12BD-01020-P50022 1 SI12BD-01020 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> depend but in general it's important because (%hesitation%) the local (%hesitation%) local news is important for your for you and your friends your family
SI12BD-01020-P50023 1 SI12BD-01020 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i think that the news is bad in general because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) you (%hesitation%) haven't (%hesitation%) the (infor-) the real information in the in the medias or in the news and it's bad for you
SI131R-00029-P10005 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 5.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm keen on music because for for me is a way to relax
SI131R-00029-P10005 1 SI131R-00029 5.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i have a busy day i usually (%hesitation%) go to my bed put on my radio or my spotify playlist and just (%hesitation%) listening to the music for relax
SI131R-00029-P10006 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 8.67 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i used to enjoy (%hesitation%) too much but because of quarantine we (c-) (%hesitation%) can't go anywhere
SI131R-00029-P10006 1 SI131R-00029 8.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so yeah i'm preparing to (%hesitation%) travel abroad when i have times and without the restriction allows us to go
SI131R-00029-P10007 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 11.19 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i think that i would meet queen elizabeth because have (%hesitation%) a cup of tea with her it could be a good story for my life
SI131R-00029-P10007 1 SI131R-00029 11.19 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> obviously i (%hesitation%) (s-) i know that she is a serious person but we could probably (%hesitation%) get too much
SI131R-00029-P10008 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 4.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it would (%hesitation%) help me probably with the with my job
SI131R-00029-P10008 1 SI131R-00029 4.59 15.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) (s-) if i (%hesitation%) know much english than now i could get (bet-) (%hesitation%) better job instead of improve my career
SI131R-00029-P10008 1 SI131R-00029 15.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and maybe i could achieve a manager (%hesitation%)
SI131R-00029-P30017 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 22.93 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantages of learning a foreign language during your study at university is that (%hesitation%) you could probably find a better a better job (%hesitation%) that in fact they are (%hesitation%) best pay than other kind of job that doesn't (%hesitation%) need a foreign language
SI131R-00029-P30017 1 SI131R-00029 22.93 28.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you can also (%hesitation%) travel (%hesitation%) in your in your work in your job
SI131R-00029-P30017 1 SI131R-00029 28.94 44.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main disadvantages is that people (%hesitation%) focus on (%hesitation%) getting a mark or a certificate in their foreign language and doesn't (%hesitation%) learn about their culture and the whole language
SI131R-00029-P30017 1 SI131R-00029 44.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion i think that people (%hesitation%) have to know how to speak another language but don't get a certificate to prove it
SI131R-00029-P50019 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> best way is probably check the social media networks (%hesitation%) to have a complete look sightseeing of the international news
SI131R-00029-P50019 1 SI131R-00029 12.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they can connect with other people from this kind of in (%hesitation%) international countries that are far
SI131R-00029-P50020 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 1.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> have no clue
SI131R-00029-P50020 1 SI131R-00029 1.88 3.29 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think so
SI131R-00029-P50020 1 SI131R-00029 3.29 8.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe (%hesitation%) the newspaper change into (%hesitation%) online newspapers

SI131R-00029-P50021 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 1.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely not
SI131R-00029-P50021 1 SI131R-00029 1.88 11.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is not (%hesitation%) reliable resources maybe because of these fake news there are on the social media
SI131R-00029-P50021 1 SI131R-00029 11.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) but if you have to trust these kind of social media you (%hesitation%) should (%hesitation%) check
SI131R-00029-P50022 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me this is extremely important to know about my local news because you get close to your environment and (%hesitation%) people that are (%hesitation%) near from you and you have to keep (%hesitation%) up to up to date too
SI131R-00029-P50023 1 SI131R-00029 0.00 10.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it it could be but i think that (%hesitation%) bad news are the news that i saw and people most of the people (%hesitation%) read this kind of news
SI131R-00029-P50023 1 SI131R-00029 10.69 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) so yes unfortunately people prefer to read bad news to reading other kind of news in social
SI131R-00033-P10005 1 SI131R-00033 0.00 3.26 <o,Q5,C,P1> oh i'm very interested in music

SI131R-00033-P10008 1 SI131R-00033 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future speaking english might help me get a better job or just simply be able to talk when i'm on holiday in foreign countries
SI131R-00033-P30017 1 SI131R-00033 0.00 20.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> the advantages of studying at least one foreign language while you're at university is when you travel abroad you'll be able to communicate with other people a lot easier
SI131R-00033-P30017 1 SI131R-00033 20.22 32.78 <o,Q4,C,P3> disadvantages are that usually people that have learned more than one language lose vocabulary of their first language
SI131R-00033-P30017 1 SI131R-00033 32.78 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion it's really good to learn a foreign language and it will help when you travel abroad and in the future when you're trying to get a job
SI131R-00033-P50019 1 SI131R-00033 0.00 9.15 <o,Q4,C,P5> the best way for students to find about international news is to read your local trusted newspaper
SI131R-00033-P50019 1 SI131R-00033 9.15 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> or as well you could always have a look at the online newspapers but be careful and choose them right

SI131R-00033-P50021 1 SI131R-00033 0.00 6.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion in my opinion social media is not a (s-) a reliable source of news
SI131R-00033-P50021 1 SI131R-00033 6.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> there is a lot of fake news as trump says and it's very biased the opinions depending on the network and the people you follow

SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 6.94 19.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> and firstly the advantages are that student will get better jobs in the future coz they speak two language
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 19.56 28.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> also they will develop skills like speaking and thinking

SI131R-00149-P50019 1 SI131R-00149 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well they must get the international news from a trustworthy resource like like p p s and other really trustworthy

SI131R-00156-P10008 1 SI131R-00156 11.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i don't (%hesitation%) find a a new job (%hesitation%) as a teacher i can work for example in the (receptioni-)
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 0.00 7.59 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion the advantage are they are be able to (%hesitation%) speak in another language for example english
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 7.59 20.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and when they (%hesitation%) start to work in a new job (%hesitation%) they can (%hesitation%) find job for example in the restaurants or hotels or teacher
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 20.77 26.76 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but and when the tourists come our country they can speak with them in a second language
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 26.76 29.13 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but there are (s-) (%hesitation%) some disadvantage
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 29.13 37.36 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for example they are going to have less time for study other sandwich (o-) other languages (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) biologist maths
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 37.36 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in my opinion is more important (%hesitation%) to learn to speak a second language than study for example ill (%hesitation%) maths or science because (%hesitation%) speak in a second language can open you different (%hesitation%) doors and is easy to (%hesitation%) find a new york work
SI131R-00156-P50019 1 SI131R-00156 0.00 14.08 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the best thing for (%hesitation%) find about information about international news is reading the newspapers or look information into internet (in-) internet computers of differents ways
SI131R-00156-P50019 1 SI131R-00156 14.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i know that in the reporters usually they're lies but is
SI131R-00156-P50020 1 SI131R-00156 0.00 9.95 <o,Q4,B1,P5> my opinion the newspapers will (%hesitation%) be disappear in the future because people don't want to pay a lot of money buy a newspaper
SI131R-00156-P50020 1 SI131R-00156 9.95 17.77 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i can (%hesitation%) watch the news online or in the computer and i don't have to (%hesitation%) pay and owe money
SI131R-00156-P50020 1 SI131R-00156 17.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i prefer (informat-)

SI131R-00156-P50021 1 SI131R-00156 13.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) the problem (%hesitation%) appear when you don't know (%hesitation%) who is say you the (tru-)
SI131R-00156-P50022 1 SI131R-00156 0.00 16.71 <o,Q4,B1,P5> for me is very important (%hesitation%) to know news that occur in my country because i want to know the problems and the vantage and new new and new news that occur (%hesitation%) where i live
SI131R-00156-P50022 1 SI131R-00156 16.71 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> if they are (%hesitation%) some problem i can (ha-)
SI131R-00156-P50023 1 SI131R-00156 0.00 7.98 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion in social media there are a lot of (%hesitation%) bad news but it isn't a problem (%hesitation%) for me
SI131R-00156-P50023 1 SI131R-00156 7.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because if died a lot of people or appear a new virus or a new disease i prefer knowing the true that i live (%hesitation%) with a
SI131R-00172-P10005 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 1.43 <o,Q4,C,P1> i love music
SI131R-00172-P10005 1 SI131R-00172 1.43 8.08 <o,Q4,C,P1> music (%hesitation%) occupy an important (pl-) place in my life in my occupations
SI131R-00172-P10005 1 SI131R-00172 8.08 11.47 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i listen to music every day
SI131R-00172-P10005 1 SI131R-00172 11.47 17.91 <o,Q4,C,P1> i like every every kind of music but i mostly love rap
SI131R-00172-P10005 1 SI131R-00172 17.91 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) yeah i like music
SI131R-00172-P10006 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 19.22 <o,Q5,C,P1> i enjoy i enjoy travelling at other places and discover other cultures but i don't want to travel too much because it's (%hesitation%) it is bad (at-) (%hesitation%) attitude for the environment to take the plane and stuff like that
SI131R-00172-P10006 1 SI131R-00172 19.22 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> you know
SI131R-00172-P10007 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 15.36 <o,Q5,C,P1> i don't have idols or people that i love beyond everything so there isn't any people that that i'd like any famous people that i'd like to to see or to meet
SI131R-00172-P10007 1 SI131R-00172 15.36 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) (al-) also i could be disappointed about the person
SI131R-00172-P10008 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 4.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it helps for
SI131R-00172-P10008 1 SI131R-00172 4.96 19.49 <o,Q5,C,P1> travelling but i think it (al-) also helps in working because we are in a globalised and connected world so (%hesitation%) i will be (%hesitation%) i will have to speak with other people from other countries
SI131R-00172-P10008 1 SI131R-00172 19.49 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 29.47 <o,Q4,C,P3> one advantage to study (%hesitation%) a foreign language to (%hesitation%) to pass your your university course is that you are forced to learn another way of speaking and another way of yeah it it opens your mind on the world and it (%hesitation%) allows you to speak to other people to discover our cultures (%hesitation%) other mindset
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 29.47 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) so i i think it's a big advantage
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 32.97 49.69 <o,Q4,C,P3> one disadvantage could be the the yeah the forced aspect well (%hesitation%) the the fact that it is required so there is (%hesitation%) a contraint (%hesitation%) that can be (%hesitation%) a little bit stressful
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 49.69 54.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> but i think it's very important in to my opinion
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 54.14 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you have to make this effort and it it's good to be that it's forced
SI131R-00172-P50019 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 10.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) first of all he can read the (re-) the international part of the newspapers of (%hesitation%) his country
SI131R-00172-P50019 1 SI131R-00172 10.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but he can also read the international press for example american (j-) (%hesitation%) newspapers (%hesitation%) british newspapers to inform with another point of view
SI131R-00172-P50020 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 6.67 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the newspapers in the paper format is maybe (%hesitation%) in danger
SI131R-00172-P50020 1 SI131R-00172 6.67 15.65 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think that newspaper with will always exist and (%hesitation%) because you know a population have to be inform
SI131R-00172-P50020 1 SI131R-00172 15.65 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you know what i mean
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 4.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important because you know you have to
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 4.39 11.74 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to be informed about your village your region and not only about the whole of the country
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 11.74 15.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have you have to be on the ground on the ground
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 15.96 17.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you know what i mean man
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 17.30 18.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you agree
SI131R-00172-P50022 1 SI131R-00172 18.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you agree
SI131R-00172-P50023 1 SI131R-00172 0.00 9.81 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that we we have to face bad news because just bad news reveal they reveal problems that have to be solved
SI131R-00172-P50023 1 SI131R-00172 9.81 15.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if we just don't look at those problems there will never be solved and there will be worsened
SI131R-00172-P50023 1 SI131R-00172 15.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that is not what we want i think
SI131R-00200-P10005 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 5.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i quite i quite into music for the reason that it will help me to relax myself
SI131R-00200-P10005 1 SI131R-00200 5.90 16.81 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i often listen to music before i go to bed because it can helps me fall asleep quickly and what's more when i come back from school i will (us-) i will listen to music to relax myself
SI131R-00200-P10005 1 SI131R-00200 16.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and that's really works and (hel-)
SI131R-00200-P10006 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 10.83 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i'm crazy about travelling to different places because i love meeting new people trying new food and (%hesitation%) entering a new environment and i can find something new there
SI131R-00200-P10006 1 SI131R-00200 10.83 17.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> what's more i strongly believe that only when you go out to see the world in person will you have a better understanding about the world
SI131R-00200-P10006 1 SI131R-00200 17.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and that will help us to (beco-)
SI131R-00200-P10007 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 7.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well it will be no doubtfully the emma watson because i think she is a such a fairness girl and she is very independent
SI131R-00200-P10007 1 SI131R-00200 7.60 9.85 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i can see the girl power from her
SI131R-00200-P10007 1 SI131R-00200 9.85 17.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i met her i will have a conversation with her about how can we become more independent and to be fairness
SI131R-00200-P10007 1 SI131R-00200 17.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i wanna communicate with her
SI131R-00200-P10008 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 7.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i think it will be great significance to me in the future because i will going to the university in america
SI131R-00200-P10008 1 SI131R-00200 7.58 13.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if my spoken english is very poor i will be have some negative impact on our study
SI131R-00200-P10008 1 SI131R-00200 13.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and what's more when i travel to there i can communicate with the resident and that really helps me a lot
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 4.77 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well from this question i would say there are some advantages about that
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 4.77 14.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example it will strengthen our ability to learn from new things and that will give us a sense of achievement and fulfilment
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 14.76 18.03 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and what's more there are some disadvantages as well
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 18.03 30.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example if we are too tired and we are overwhelmed about our our study that we major in so we can't spend more time on another things for example to learn another language
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 30.91 39.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if we spend too much time on learning about another languages and that we can't concentrate on the study that we major in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 39.00 42.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is just keep a good balance
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 42.18 48.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it depends if you are too tired with your study work so you don't have to attend a foreign language class
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 48.83 52.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you just need to concentrate yourself on the study that you are major in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 52.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and everyone should be flexible about their opinion they made
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 6.08 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way for me to understand the international news is by searching online
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200 6.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example we can use the b b c or the v o a to read some news online and then we can have a better understanding of what happen what is (hap-) happening on the world
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 15.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i am not fully agree with this idea but i think the newspaper will be on a gre be on dis decrease because with the development of the technogic so we always use watch some news on our phones instead of watch newspaper
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200 15.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so in that way the number of newspaper will be on a decrease
SI131R-00200-P50021 1 SI131R-00200 0.00 1.24 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it depends
SI131R-00200-P50021 1 SI131R-00200 1.24 18.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think all the information on the social media is all that true and that we can trust it because some people will driven by the profit or something else and they will put something fake online to in order to get some aims
SI131R-00200-P50021 1 SI131R-00200 18.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and in that way it
SI131R-00209-P10005 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 10.11 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am interested in music because for me i love
SI131R-00209-P10005 1 SI131R-00209 10.11 14.91 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it's a relax way if you would like to disconnect your mind
SI131R-00209-P10005 1 SI131R-00209 14.91 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and also sometimes (%hesitation%) you can dance
SI131R-00209-P10006 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 9.45 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy a lot because for me it's really important to know different cultures
SI131R-00209-P10006 1 SI131R-00209 9.45 15.53 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and also i love tasting (%hesitation%) different types of food
SI131R-00209-P10006 1 SI131R-00209 15.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i love travel around the world
SI131R-00209-P10007 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 16.79 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i (w-) i would like to meet a writer because i would like to asked (%hesitation%) how (%hesitation%) did they organise all the ideas to make a book
SI131R-00209-P10007 1 SI131R-00209 16.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's an interesting way
SI131R-00209-P10008 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> speaking english will help me on the future a lot because i work as a receptionist and i need learn a language because for the reason i can contact with other people and we can share opinions and help it
SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 30.17 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the first advantage if you would like to learn a foreign language (%hesitation%) is that increase your offers when you would like to find a job because if you learn a lot of languages (%hesitation%) you can find a better job than other people
SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 30.17 46.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) a disvantage for me is the level or the difficulty because study a language is not easy and you need take more time (%hesitation%) to study
SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 46.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) if you have the opportunity to learn a foreign languages try to do it because it will be better for our future
SI131R-00209-P50019 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 7.62 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the best way to find international news is through the internet
SI131R-00209-P50019 1 SI131R-00209 7.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in internet (%hesitation%) you have a lot of pages and you can search and found a lot of information
SI131R-00209-P50020 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i'm agree with that (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) the new technologies are being (%hesitation%) in our life each day more stronger and for the environment (%hesitation%) (w-) we waste a lot of paper and it's not good
SI131R-00209-P50021 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> social media are very important in our life because it's the modern life and everyone seems to have one or two or more electronic devices and and that's it
SI131R-00209-P50022 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 13.07 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's important keep up local news because for the reason (%hesitation%) we know the information around us
SI131R-00209-P50022 1 SI131R-00209 13.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because if you if we don't learn news we don't know
SI131R-00209-P50023 1 SI131R-00209 0.00 3.02 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think this is true
SI131R-00209-P50023 1 SI131R-00209 3.02 12.85 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) for example at the moment (%hesitation%) it's the most important news around is coronovirus
SI131R-00209-P50023 1 SI131R-00209 12.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00221-P10005 1 SI131R-00221 0.00 4.71 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i'm quite keen on music
SI131R-00221-P10005 1 SI131R-00221 4.71 18.40 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love listening to music (%hesitation%) such as rock blues jazz and (%hesitation%) lately i like listening to instrumental music
SI131R-00221-P10005 1 SI131R-00221 18.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> make me feel relaxed

SI131R-00221-P30017 1 SI131R-00221 42.56 52.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i cannot think about disadvantages coz the more you know the better is for your knowledge
SI131R-00221-P30017 1 SI131R-00221 52.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if you can speak a foreign language is my opinion

SI131R-00221-P50019 1 SI131R-00221 7.21 15.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i look for news on the internet international pages international news
SI131R-00221-P50019 1 SI131R-00221 15.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that is a very good way to learn and to know
SI131R-00221-P50020 1 SI131R-00221 0.00 4.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm not quite sure about that
SI131R-00221-P50020 1 SI131R-00221 4.04 11.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the future and the present is (%hesitation%) a (ver-) they more digital news
SI131R-00221-P50020 1 SI131R-00221 11.32 12.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that is true
SI131R-00221-P50020 1 SI131R-00221 12.75 17.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and every day less people buy new newspaper
SI131R-00221-P50020 1 SI131R-00221 17.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think is not going this
SI131R-00221-P50021 1 SI131R-00221 0.00 2.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> good question for me
SI131R-00221-P50021 1 SI131R-00221 2.79 4.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely no
SI131R-00221-P50021 1 SI131R-00221 4.64 5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no way

SI131R-00221-P50021 1 SI131R-00221 10.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> social media is (%hesitation%) to connect with friends but not to get information about news
SI131R-00221-P50022 1 SI131R-00221 0.00 9.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think to keep up to date is very important because we have to know the world we are living

SI131R-00226-P10008 1 SI131R-00226 0.00 5.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> it's clear that speaking english open many doors for you
SI131R-00226-P10008 1 SI131R-00226 5.54 14.14 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can apply for a better job you have the possibility to work abroad to communicate with people from all over the world
SI131R-00226-P10008 1 SI131R-00226 14.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so it's clear you have more possibility to have a better life in comparison with
SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 0.00 9.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well the the main advantage will be the possibility to speak another language
SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 9.88 19.03 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so this is impressive in your curriculum and your and your life the possibility to to speak other other language
SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 19.03 21.36 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage could be the time
SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 21.36 31.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) it's common knowledge that the the the the time in the university is limited and there are a lot of subject

SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 41.62 53.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion i believe it's totally necessary because when the students could learn another language it's a privilege
SI131R-00226-P30017 1 SI131R-00226 53.32 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you can (%hesitation%) you are going to to have more open doors when when you
SI131R-00226-P50019 1 SI131R-00226 0.00 18.22 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i suppose the best way is searching information on the internet for example in website (%hesitation%) such as b b c or sky news because you can access news around the world
SI131R-00226-P50019 1 SI131R-00226 18.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and maybe you can improve your (eng-)
SI131R-00226-P50020 1 SI131R-00226 0.00 10.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely because i believe the newspaper is something old fashioned because people prefer to search information in other ways

SI131R-00382-P10008 1 SI131R-00382 19.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so
SI131R-00382-P30017 1 SI131R-00382 0.00 23.50 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) the many (%hesitation%) the main advantages of learning a foreign language (%hesitation%) should be (%hesitation%) of course if you want to study there or live there for a while or work (%hesitation%) in the the country where where the other language is spoken
SI131R-00382-P30017 1 SI131R-00382 23.50 26.03 <o,Q4,C,P3> of course that that is an advantage
SI131R-00382-P30017 1 SI131R-00382 26.03 31.20 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) disadvantage i don't see any
SI131R-00382-P30017 1 SI131R-00382 31.20 48.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in fact i think it should be more advantage if if (%hesitation%) we for example learn english because it's (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a language that is spoken (%hesitation%) all around the world
SI131R-00382-P30017 1 SI131R-00382 48.02 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but i think that in my opinion (%hesitation%) it's always (%hesitation%) a plus (%hesitation%) not just for your resume but (%hesitation%) for
SI131R-00382-P50020 1 SI131R-00382 0.00 2.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) not completely
SI131R-00382-P50020 1 SI131R-00382 2.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) of course i think that newspapers will become less popular let's say (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) i know that (%hesitation%) a lot of people prefer to read (%hesitation%) the news or even books in the the paper

SI131R-00382-P50023 1 SI131R-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that (%hesitation%) the media of course (%hesitation%) they go after (%hesitation%) big news and big tabloids and (%hesitation%) bad news (attrac-) (%hesitation%) attract views and (%hesitation%) and raise the the share
SI131R-00406-P10005 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 8.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love (%hesitation%) listening music (%hesitation%) specially (%hesitation%) music from the eighties

SI131R-00406-P10006 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 6.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love to travel to different places and know (%hesitation%) different countries
SI131R-00406-P10006 1 SI131R-00406 6.10 14.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i try to to visit (%hesitation%) one different country (%hesitation%) each year
SI131R-00406-P10006 1 SI131R-00406 14.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) in fact i have visited (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) united kingdom (ita-)

SI131R-00406-P10007 1 SI131R-00406 11.00 17.80 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think it's it's (%hesitation%) a very (%hesitation%) kindy (%hesitation%) person
SI131R-00406-P10007 1 SI131R-00406 17.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and and it's it's (ama-)

SI131R-00406-P10008 1 SI131R-00406 4.72 18.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and and i need to to speak (%hesitation%) english fluently because (%hesitation%) most (%hesitation%) schools in spain have a bilingual section
SI131R-00406-P10008 1 SI131R-00406 18.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so is is (essen-)
SI131R-00406-P30017 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 20.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main advantage (%hesitation%) advantage for students (%hesitation%) that study at least one foreign language in order (%hesitation%) in order to pass their university course is (%hesitation%) that they develop (%hesitation%) their speaking abilities
SI131R-00406-P30017 1 SI131R-00406 20.06 38.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) one of the disadvantages (%hesitation%) could (%hesitation%) should be that (%hesitation%) they have (%hesitation%) to study harder the rest of the of the subjects because they have less less time (%hesitation%) to do this
SI131R-00406-P30017 1 SI131R-00406 38.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) but i am convinced (%hesitation%) that (i-) it's it's very important (%hesitation%) to know how to speak (%hesitation%) other language (%hesitation%) in order to to improve and and learn (%hesitation%) other skills
SI131R-00406-P50019 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 11.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the best way for students to find out (%hesitation%) about international news is surfing on the internet or follow international news sites on twitter for example
SI131R-00406-P50019 1 SI131R-00406 11.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it's very quickly and and you can get information in (%hesitation%) real time
SI131R-00406-P50020 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 10.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) yes i agree with that because everybody will have a smartphone (%hesitation%) where you can get the news at the moment (%hesitation%) it happens
SI131R-00406-P50020 1 SI131R-00406 10.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so is faster and you don't need to wait until the next edition
SI131R-00406-P50021 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 2.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well it depends

SI131R-00406-P50021 1 SI131R-00406 11.08 20.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> although sometimes they are (%hesitation%) a lot of (%hesitation%) fake news
SI131R-00406-P50022 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 9.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well if you are living in a (%hesitation%) in a local place (%hesitation%) you have to know what it happens (%hesitation%) where you live
SI131R-00406-P50022 1 SI131R-00406 9.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think (%hesitation%) it's it's very important to know (%hesitation%) what happen in your local area
SI131R-00406-P50023 1 SI131R-00406 0.00 2.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i think so
SI131R-00406-P50023 1 SI131R-00406 2.50 18.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if if if we don't (%hesitation%) had (%hesitation%) the chance (%hesitation%) of searching (%hesitation%) at the moment we we didn't know (%hesitation%) a lot of (%hesitation%) the bad things that happens in the world
SI131R-00406-P50023 1 SI131R-00406 18.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so yeah i think
SI131R-00476-P10005 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 4.90 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i'm not really interested in music and (%hesitation%) way of studying it
SI131R-00476-P10005 1 SI131R-00476 4.90 10.17 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i'm more interested in the way of listen to it and going to concerts
SI131R-00476-P10005 1 SI131R-00476 10.17 13.94 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i love listening to music but i i'm not a good singer
SI131R-00476-P10005 1 SI131R-00476 13.94 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> so i love listening to it but not singing at the time
SI131R-00476-P10006 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 5.46 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy travelling to (dis-) to different places coz i love to travel
SI131R-00476-P10006 1 SI131R-00476 5.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i love to travel alone to learn more about the place where i am and going to to native go to speak with native people and stay in home places
SI131R-00476-P10007 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 5.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would really like to meet zac efron which is my favourite actor
SI131R-00476-P10007 1 SI131R-00476 5.88 13.27 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i follow him since it is high school musical which was a really good film
SI131R-00476-P10007 1 SI131R-00476 13.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it makes the difference in this name and that time
SI131R-00476-P10008 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 8.59 <o,Q3,B2,P1> as i would like to be a businesswomen i would like to have an international company
SI131R-00476-P10008 1 SI131R-00476 8.59 14.08 <o,Q3,B2,P1> and i would also like to do a master in international relations
SI131R-00476-P10008 1 SI131R-00476 14.08 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> so is english is going to be my day by day
SI131R-00476-P30017 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 9.51 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so firstly i want to talk about the advantages of learning at least one foreigns language in order to pass the university
SI131R-00476-P30017 1 SI131R-00476 9.51 24.42 <o,Q3,B2,P3> the students will achieve by this learning a new language and this will give them the opportunity to travel abroad and to know how to meet other people there and can speak with native speakers
SI131R-00476-P30017 1 SI131R-00476 24.42 31.04 <o,Q3,B2,P3> and also they will have the opportunity to look for a job out of their country
SI131R-00476-P30017 1 SI131R-00476 31.04 42.24 <o,Q3,B2,P3> as a disadvantage they will needs to know how to organise their time for study and also to for learning an other another language so they will need to be really organised
SI131R-00476-P30017 1 SI131R-00476 42.24 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my own opinion it's really important for students to have another language about even if they have their native language because this give them more opportunities in their laboral life
SI131R-00476-P50019 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 9.93 <o,Q3,B1,P5> i think now that we can use technology and we are able to find out information anywhere in the mobile phone
SI131R-00476-P50019 1 SI131R-00476 9.93 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> best way for them is to enter into a page from that country and look for new news
SI131R-00476-P50020 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i really agree with this opinion because the newspapers are going to be obsolete in some years coz now the technology is taking its spot and all people are looking for in their mobile phone
SI131R-00476-P50021 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 6.08 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion it depends on what type of social media we are talking about
SI131R-00476-P50021 1 SI131R-00476 6.08 11.50 <o,Q4,B1,P5> for example maybe in twitter it is a social media and it depends the account you are following
SI131R-00476-P50021 1 SI131R-00476 11.50 17.52 <o,Q4,B1,P5> if you (%hesitation%) follow a important account maybe it's true what it's saying
SI131R-00476-P50021 1 SI131R-00476 17.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but you have to
SI131R-00476-P50022 1 SI131R-00476 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> you need to keep up with local news because it's something that you have to deal with every day in your daily life because you are there living and you need to know what is happening around you

SI131R-00560-P10006 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 11.42 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well as an avid traveller i would say that is one the most beautiful good things that we have in the world
SI131R-00560-P10006 1 SI131R-00560 11.42 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i mean it's such an amazing pleasure to be able to go and visit everywhere
SI131R-00560-P10007 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 12.42 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i could travel back in time to meet a famous i would like to meet pope juan pablo the second one
SI131R-00560-P10007 1 SI131R-00560 12.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> even without having met in person he has always transmitted me like an incredible vibe

SI131R-00560-P10008 1 SI131R-00560 5.41 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> but i definitely think for sure that english will be as it is today the most important language in the world and the lingua franca to speak (inter-)
SI131R-00560-P30017 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 5.44 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) well well it's a hotly debated topic depend the person who you are asking to
SI131R-00560-P30017 1 SI131R-00560 5.44 30.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> regarding to the first question i would say that (%hesitation%) at least studying at least one foreigns foreign language in order to pass the university course has one advantages at least (li-) as such as give you the opportunity to work in a different country that you are living in
SI131R-00560-P30017 1 SI131R-00560 30.80 47.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) according to the second one i reckon you can you can find difficult the thing of studying a foreigns language instead you go abroad and immerse yourself in the cultures
SI131R-00560-P30017 1 SI131R-00560 47.58 58.26 <o,Q4,B2,P3> finally answering the last one from my point of view the more things you study the better opportunities you will have
SI131R-00560-P30017 1 SI131R-00560 58.26 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so that summarize my opinion
SI131R-00560-P50019 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 17.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well if we are talking about young people i would probably say that they find very useful social media so maybe the better the best way for them is to look for information in social media
SI131R-00560-P50019 1 SI131R-00560 17.21 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean facebook or
SI131R-00560-P50020 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 2.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i completely agree
SI131R-00560-P50020 1 SI131R-00560 2.33 9.40 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean the print medium as we know it now i think it won't it will no longer exist anymore
SI131R-00560-P50020 1 SI131R-00560 9.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean we have a lot of different ways to be informed and to be aware the world situation
SI131R-00560-P50021 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 2.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> no definitely no
SI131R-00560-P50021 1 SI131R-00560 2.76 7.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean social media is full of fake news and people's thoughts
SI131R-00560-P50021 1 SI131R-00560 7.96 18.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so there is no point no meaning in believing in believe some things that people think because they can invent everything
SI131R-00560-P50021 1 SI131R-00560 18.55 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so
SI131R-00560-P50022 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 5.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i reckon the importance of local news as much as international news
SI131R-00560-P50022 1 SI131R-00560 5.28 13.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean you have to be aware you have to interested in where you live local and international
SI131R-00560-P50022 1 SI131R-00560 13.12 16.47 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can help your neighbourhood
SI131R-00560-P50022 1 SI131R-00560 16.47 19.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can help the local charity
SI131R-00560-P50022 1 SI131R-00560 19.21 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 0.00 2.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> unfortunately it's true
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 2.32 3.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i completely agree
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 3.37 5.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 5.84 8.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but there is no meaning in avoid them
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 8.44 13.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean we should be aware of what's happening in in the world
SI131R-00560-P50023 1 SI131R-00560 13.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's like an obligation to know what's the situation

SI131R-00655-P10008 1 SI131R-00655 8.23 14.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when you speak a second language (%hesitation%) mostly english it will open so many doors to you

SI131R-00655-P30017 1 SI131R-00655 7.91 15.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if you learn a new language you you could have more knowledge

SI131R-00655-P30017 1 SI131R-00655 54.79 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> our politician can decide about the world without knowing (anythi-)
SI131R-00655-P50019 1 SI131R-00655 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the best way is just check in the internet because you have a lot of newspaper all around the world then you can know (%hesitation%) just (%hesitation%) at the moment whatever news you want to check
SI131R-00655-P50020 1 SI131R-00655 0.00 6.25 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think there will be newspaper but without paper
SI131R-00655-P50020 1 SI131R-00655 6.25 20.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> then you will check it in the internet or your tablet mobile phone but you will not be allowed to buy a physical newspaper
SI131R-00655-P50021 1 SI131R-00655 0.00 12.75 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it depends on which person you are following and if you can believe or you know they have (%hesitation%) fiable (%hesitation%) resources
SI131R-00655-P50021 1 SI131R-00655 12.75 19.53 <o,Q4,B1,P5> then (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think you should have a look first in the newspaper

SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667 0.00 7.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's a fact that studying languages it's really relevant for our future life
SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667 7.92 23.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so according to advantages one positive point is that students can learn other languages so that they can move to another country and have no problem
SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667 23.27 37.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the second place regarding disadvantages an argument against is that maybe it could have more time for them instead of being studying
SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667 37.16 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> finally but from my point of view it seems to me that is better to learn new languages in the at the university instead of not doing that
SI131R-00667-P50019 1 SI131R-00667 0.00 7.42 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's a fact that social media are in our lives all the time
SI131R-00667-P50019 1 SI131R-00667 7.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it may be can be the best option for students to get to know international news for example by instagram or twitter
SI131R-00667-P50020 1 SI131R-00667 0.00 9.76 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is believed that maybe the paper will be disappeared in a few years

SI131R-00667-P50021 1 SI131R-00667 12.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think you we should be careful with cheaters

SI131R-00706-P30017 1 SI131R-00706 0.00 21.37 <o,Q4,C,P3> well the advantages of studying other language in order to pass their university course is that you must know at least two languages well
SI131R-00706-P30017 1 SI131R-00706 21.37 25.94 <o,Q4,C,P3> that gives you more opportunities in the future

SI131R-00706-P30017 1 SI131R-00706 35.11 49.01 <o,Q4,C,P3> one of the disadvantages could be (%hesitation%) that for many people to learn a new language is difficult
SI131R-00706-P30017 1 SI131R-00706 49.01 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> my opinion i think it's necessary to learn at least one foreign language to pass their university course
SI131R-00706-P50019 1 SI131R-00706 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way for find information for students is their laptops or mobile phone because you can browse on the internet some international news and you can read the newspapers you want
SI131R-00706-P50020 1 SI131R-00706 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i am totally agree with it because nowadays the newspaper are quite obsolete because you can read the newspaper on the internet and you don't have to buy it
SI131R-00706-P50021 1 SI131R-00706 0.00 8.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends on the research that you find the information

SI131R-00706-P50022 1 SI131R-00706 0.00 7.51 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if you want to be up to date i think it's important to be aware of the local news

SI137O-00282-P10007 1 SI137O-00282 13.02 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would also like to to meet his brother noel gallagher but i think definitely liam
SI137O-00282-P10008 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 8.75 <o,Q5,C,P1> speaking a good english may help you in getting a promotion
SI137O-00282-P10008 1 SI137O-00282 8.75 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) my company the spanish tax agency has to work with other european agencies so english is quite important
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 6.57 <o,Q4,C,P3> learning another foreign language is really important
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 6.57 11.54 <o,Q4,C,P3> it definitely has more advantages than disadvantages
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 11.54 19.68 <o,Q4,C,P3> one of the main benefits is that it may help you find a better (do-) job
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 19.68 29.74 <o,Q4,C,P3> when you study at university in the end you try to get a formation to improve your skills
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 29.74 35.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> and your goal is that when you end that university you find a good job
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 35.02 39.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> so learning another language (%hesitation%) will help you with this
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 39.91 51.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand (%hesitation%) one drawback is that (%hesitation%) you will has have less time to study your current degree
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 51.21 59.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion (%hesitation%) you have enough time to study (aba-) absolutely everything
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 59.56 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so
SI137O-00282-P50019 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 7.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> fortunately nowadays it is quite easy to follow international news
SI137O-00282-P50019 1 SI137O-00282 7.91 11.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> all you need to have is a good internet connections
SI137O-00282-P50019 1 SI137O-00282 11.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) today (%hesitation%) all newspapers have a digital version where you can find out all your (in-)
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 3.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i disagree with the statements
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282 3.50 8.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) newspapers will continue existing in the future
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282 8.62 11.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however they will need to change
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282 11.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they will have to become (%hesitation%) more digital and adapt to new era
SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 2.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not at all
SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282 2.22 7.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think social media is a good way to broadcast fake news
SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282 7.53 11.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's not reliable at all
SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282 11.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should follow traditional newspapers and classical tv channels
SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 6.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's really important to be updated about your local news
SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282 6.17 13.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> people usually do tend more national policy or internationals news
SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282 13.50 15.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but in my opinion it's a mistake
SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282 15.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's more important to you to know what it close it happens (clo-)
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 0.00 4.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes maybe there is too much bad news in the media
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 4.79 11.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but that it's a reflection of what it really happens in the world
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 11.22 17.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> on the other hand media just want to get (%hesitation%) more audience
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 17.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that's (%hesitation%) what people want to hear
SI137O-00490-P10005 1 SI137O-00490 0.00 8.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like listening to a wide range of music such as pop music country music and classical music
SI137O-00490-P10005 1 SI137O-00490 8.61 13.09 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so music i like to listen cover a wide range of fields

SI137O-00490-P10008 1 SI137O-00490 9.60 13.09 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and most of the paperworks are written in english

SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 0.00 8.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> nowadays many students are required to study at least one foreign language in their university studying plan
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 8.31 11.43 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think there are many advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 11.43 22.54 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first of all students who study at at least one foreign language (ca-) such as english can communicate with the native english speaker better
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 22.54 33.80 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and (%hesitation%) (s-) nowadays most of the paperworks are written in english so if they want to deepen their understanding of these academic papers they need to learn english
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 33.80 42.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but for many students that won't talk with this toh this (%hesitation%) foreign foreigners for a long time it will just waste the time
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 42.71 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in conclusion i think it's necessary to study at least one foreign language coz china is become a more and more international country now

SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490 0.00 14.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with this point but i think it may takes a long time to finish this because many people likes to read the news on the newspaper and they don't know how to use the internet
SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490 14.38 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) the media has been more convenient nowadays
SI137O-00490-P50021 1 SI137O-00490 0.00 2.92 <o,Q4,B1,P5> no i don't think so
SI137O-00490-P50021 1 SI137O-00490 2.92 14.27 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) in the most case social media provides the true information but on the other hand they usually provide a faulty information

SI137O-00490-P50023 1 SI137O-00490 5.47 15.16 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) but i think (i-) it's not a big deal because for the bad new you can (%hesitation%) you can ignore them for sure

SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596 13.46 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example we go to a friend's house in the mountains and it's pretty cool

SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 3.74 <o,Q5,C,P1> well speaking english is always an advantage
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596 3.74 11.68 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can communicate with a lot of people from different countries because the the language is so international
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596 11.68 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example with some friends (%hesitation%) who don't speak either german and (s-) or spanish i can communicate with them in through english
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 8.85 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think (%hesitation%) it helps students like (%hesitation%) stimulate another part of the brain
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 8.85 22.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> mostly if you're just studying like a scientific career like in my case your (%hesitation%) exercises and activities are pretty much the same through the whole career
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 22.91 26.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> a lot of monotony and pretty homogeneous
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 26.89 38.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) if you have to study at least one foreign language you you will have to develop other (%hesitation%) abilities that don't come from your career
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 38.88 42.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's it could have advantages
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 42.30 48.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> disadvantage is it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice and you really don't have that much time
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 48.82 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think (%hesitation%) maybe english is ok because it really is helpful in your life but other languages it's maybe not that important
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 8.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well with the new technologies probably like follow some instagram pages of news that are from other countries
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596 8.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) and if you're really interested and you really get to search every day for news then you can do it that way
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 10.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well maybe not newspapers as we know them now (%hesitation%) in that physical form but i think (%hesitation%) in the digital form they will have a lot of impact
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596 10.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and and (%hesitation%) with that much (%hesitation%) misinformation going on it's really important to have reliable source
SI137O-00596-P50021 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 16.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> as i said previously (%hesitation%) (s-) social media is not really very reliable source but some pages in that (%hesitation%) social media can be reliable sources like (i-) important newspapers
SI137O-00596-P50021 1 SI137O-00596 16.45 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't know maybe b b c or (%hesitation%)
SI137O-00596-P50022 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 7.76 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think it's important to know what's going on around the world and in your country and in your city
SI137O-00596-P50022 1 SI137O-00596 7.76 13.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> don't know (%hesitation%) it doesn't affect you directly in most of the times
SI137O-00596-P50022 1 SI137O-00596 13.27 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but for example with this ukraine war you can understand why gas is so (%hesitation%) expensive now
SI137O-00596-P50023 1 SI137O-00596 0.00 14.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would agree but it's because it's the news that (%hesitation%) make the most (%hesitation%) influence that move the most of people and what people look for
SI137O-00596-P50023 1 SI137O-00596 14.73 18.25 <o,Q5,C,P5> they are if if they read something good they won't care

SI137O-00848-P30017 1 SI137O-00848 10.45 23.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> i mean on the one hand (%hesitation%) we live in a globalised society so (%hesitation%) learning a foreign language (%hesitation%) will be really useful for your future
SI137O-00848-P30017 1 SI137O-00848 23.88 28.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> this is an advantage that which deserves to be considered

SI137O-00848-P50020 1 SI137O-00848 7.45 18.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it seems to me that the the future of newspapers is darker than those people would like
SI137O-00848-P50020 1 SI137O-00848 18.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree
SI137O-00848-P50021 1 SI137O-00848 0.00 7.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) actually fake news is one of the hottest topic nowadays
SI137O-00848-P50021 1 SI137O-00848 7.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is true that you can find a lot of information in social media but you have to be that criterion and know how to choose the correct (inform-)
SI137O-00848-P50022 1 SI137O-00848 0.00 5.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well as i said before we all live in a globalised society
SI137O-00848-P50022 1 SI137O-00848 5.97 10.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but sometimes that means that we lose perspective
SI137O-00848-P50022 1 SI137O-00848 10.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the role played by local news is to (%hesitation%) take the foot on earth
SI137O-00848-P50023 1 SI137O-00848 0.00 3.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i completely agree
SI137O-00848-P50023 1 SI137O-00848 3.49 12.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) let me see that (%hesitation%) i know that horrible things happen every day in our world
SI137O-00848-P50023 1 SI137O-00848 12.44 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but sometimes i believe that media (%hesitation%) find those happenings to
SI137O-01016-P10005 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 4.67 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i spend almost all my day listening to music
SI137O-01016-P10005 1 SI137O-01016 4.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy a lot listening to new artists to songs that my favourite artists posts and sharing music it's also a thing that i really enjoy
SI137O-01016-P10006 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really love travelling to different countries especially if they don't speak a language that i know or that it's familiar to me because that makes me feel in a totally different cultures and for job for sure my favourite (%hesitation%) way to travel is with friends
SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 6.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016 6.05 13.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> he's an former (%hesitation%) professional goalkeeper and he was my idol when i was a kid
SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016 13.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it would be so amazing to have a conversation with him
SI137O-01016-P10008 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 9.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> with the nowadays (%hesitation%) globalisation every job demands us to to speak english fluently
SI137O-01016-P10008 1 SI137O-01016 9.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so learning english is a skill that everybody will need in the future and for sure it would help me to find new jobs
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in spain the country i live in it is mandatory to study one foreigns language or to have a b one level in a foreigns language to pass (%hesitation%) the university course
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 16.38 30.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) and i think it's (%hesitation%) it's totally fair since you will need to learn for example english or another foreign language (%hesitation%) in to in your future jobs
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 30.30 39.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so the advantages of (%hesitation%) (re-) being required to learn a foreigns language is that you will have that in advance
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 39.48 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however the disadvantages is that for people (%hesitation%) who are not (%hesitation%) who is not that easy to learn new new languages it must it can be an difficulty (%hesitation%) added to the fact to passing the university course
SI137O-01016-P50019 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> the best way for students to find about international news is to search on the internet the main newspapers that covers internationals (%hesitation%) main (%hesitation%) events for example times (%hesitation%) the new york times or the b b c
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 5.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) well the future of the newspaper is not well known
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016 5.83 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> however (%hesitation%) what i think is that the the newspaper in paper will disappear however the newspaper the online web newspaper will remain active
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 6.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> as i see it social media is not a reliable source of news at all
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016 6.62 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> social media is a place where people post how they want to look (%hesitation%) how they want their lives to look and where fake news are everywhere
SI137O-01016-P50022 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 10.46 <o,Q4,C,P5> it is super important in my opinion to be aware and to be up to date about what is happening in your city
SI137O-01016-P50022 1 SI137O-01016 10.46 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so checking local news frequently is a thing that we all should do
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016 0.00 6.29 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think there are both good and bad news in the media
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016 6.29 15.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> however it is obvious that we will focus on bad news and those bad news are the one that we will remember the most
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016 15.83 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and also it's important to show that the world is not a good place
