SI114J-00011-P10005 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 8.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> well to be honest i am not that i'm not a big fan of (%hesitation%) environment
SI114J-00011-P10005 1 SI114J-00011 8.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) but however i am still care about (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) the environment and trees and animals
SI114J-00011-P10006 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 7.55 <o,Q5,C,P1> are plenty of things we really enjoy doing (%hesitation%) during our free time
SI114J-00011-P10006 1 SI114J-00011 7.55 15.59 <o,Q5,C,P1> so let's say for example last week we have played football game with my friends
SI114J-00011-P10006 1 SI114J-00011 15.59 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) the other one we played online (ga-)
SI114J-00011-P10007 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 1.38 <o,Q4,C,P1> yes
SI114J-00011-P10007 1 SI114J-00011 1.38 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i suppose to be (simila-) similar to my sister because (%hesitation%) she is (%hesitation%) near my age and we have some very related topics like we both enjoy playing games and computers
SI114J-00011-P10008 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> my whole life i've been living in damascus syria but in in the future i'm planning to get the nationality in canada and i'm i'm also planning to reside there for the rest of my life
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 7.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) having the fitness classes is a very critical thing
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 7.22 16.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> students should keep their health and wellness in its best part because they are in the the best age of health
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 16.95 28.42 <o,Q5,C,P3> and they have to to focus on that age to do many sports and to do (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) other other work workouts
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 28.42 32.60 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) actually on the other hand it has some disadvantages
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 32.60 37.27 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example (%hesitation%) you know it might take their time
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 37.27 42.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) you know (%hesitation%) schools doesn't have that amount of time
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 42.31 53.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 53.30 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> my opinion is definitely to do fitness classes inside the school
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 1.86 <o,Q5,C,P4> hello everyone
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 1.86 8.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> in today's presentation we are going to talk about honey and how it's produced
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 8.04 18.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> so we are going to tell you how it's going from from flower to your hand and how it's produced
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 18.98 25.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> first bees collect the nectar from flowers
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 25.56 35.74 <o,Q5,C,P4> then they they return to the beehives and make the honey using the nectar
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 35.74 43.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 43.23 48.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> then those honey are stored in the glasses
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 48.42 55.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> when when they are stored they are shipped to the shops and supermarkets
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 55.14 58.05 <o,Q5,C,P4> this is the journey of the honey
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 58.05 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> i hope you enjoy it
SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 12.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> there's no doubt that choosing a country is essential thing for students in order to decide in which (%hesitation%) university they want to study
SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011 12.45 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the first they should consider the safety of the country and the education equality
SI114J-00011-P50020 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 16.82 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think for sure it has many (d-) advantages like for example let's say that if you are studying in another language first of all you're going to learn simply the the culture of this language
SI114J-00011-P50020 1 SI114J-00011 16.82 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> in addition to that you'll understand the (classm-)
SI114J-00011-P50021 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 8.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> there is no doubt that the students who want study abroad would face many difficulties
SI114J-00011-P50021 1 SI114J-00011 8.68 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> let's say for example first and foremost (%hesitation%) they are going to face (%hesitation%) the issue of doing food and cook
SI114J-00011-P50022 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> students has many other options in order to learn about the local country and the local culture
SI114J-00011-P50022 1 SI114J-00011 10.71 16.35 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion they can go and participate in social events
SI114J-00011-P50022 1 SI114J-00011 16.35 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and they can make some friends with local
SI114J-00011-P50023 1 SI114J-00011 0.00 19.53 <o,Q5,C,P5> i reckon it's an essential thing because without it (%hesitation%) students cannot (%hesitation%) be independent so clearly obviously when you when a student study abroad he will depend on himself
SI114J-00011-P50023 1 SI114J-00011 19.53 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and (every-)
SI114J-00045-P10005 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 13.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i said before i am from a little village in north spain in the middle of nowhere and and i live in mountains so i'm very very interested in environment
SI114J-00045-P10005 1 SI114J-00045 13.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i think that global global heat is a
SI114J-00045-P10006 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 5.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> what we enjoy the most is playing video games
SI114J-00045-P10006 1 SI114J-00045 5.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we love a lot of to play counter strike global offensive which is a video game a shooter game where teams of five (%hesitation%) fight
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am most similar to my father
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 4.34 16.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i have not only in in a physical way but in a intellectual way we have similar ways of thought and of think
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 16.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and we have a lot of a
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 3.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to live in a city
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 3.43 16.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like most the cities i like the most are london paris (%hesitation%) and here in spain i would like to live in in madrid or in barcelona
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 16.27 17.46 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i don't care
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 17.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but yeah i would like to live (i-)
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 14.10 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that nowadays one of the biggest problems that we affront as a society is mental and physical health
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 14.10 37.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that school and college should make time in the school to practice some exercises and and to promote a more fitness lifestyle because it can help (%hesitation%) to fight those physical and both physical and mental health
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 37.78 54.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time the disadvantage of of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as as a study time or learning some other things
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 54.21 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time maybe not everyone will enjoy because not everyone like
SI114J-00045-P40018 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> honey is collected from bees
SI114J-00045-P50019 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 16.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that when a student is chosen a country to go to study there (%hesitation%) the first thing that they are thinking about is about the university quality
SI114J-00045-P50019 1 SI114J-00045 16.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time at the same level (univers-)
SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 11.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the best thing of studying in a second language is that you can put in in your resume
SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 11.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time it is a very valuable thing from that enterprises value
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of constraints when you're studying in another country
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 6.79 16.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all you have to learn a new language and talk in a new language or in a second in your second language
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 16.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and overall i think that
SI114J-00045-P50022 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 14.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that students can learn (%hesitation%) from local culture (%hesitation%) going with their classmates and and learning from them asking them
SI114J-00045-P50022 1 SI114J-00045 14.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time i think a good way is just taking a walk and and (visi-)
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything (a-) at your own
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 11.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have to to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you don't do when you live alone
SI114J-00057-P10005 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 9.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00057-P10005 1 SI114J-00057 9.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is too cold in winter and too hot in summer
SI114J-00057-P10006 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 8.38 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in holiday i like to enjoy my time because is a break
SI114J-00057-P10006 1 SI114J-00057 8.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to travel go to the beach and (s-) sometimes i stay at home (%hesitation%) watching movies
SI114J-00057-P10007 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i like spend time with all my family (%hesitation%) with my brothers with my sister with my fathers parents and also with my cousins
SI114J-00057-P10008 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 7.70 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in the future i would like to work in a company called johnson and johnson
SI114J-00057-P10008 1 SI114J-00057 7.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i would like the position of the engineer senior in the area of the develop new products
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 9.89 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion is a good idea that students in get a job to pay their studies
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 9.89 22.61 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but you had to haved of a job of the half time because you have to get a balance between your students and your job
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 22.61 43.05 <o,Q3,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) one of the advantage is that you can get experience because a lot of students get (g-) graduate but they they have not idea about how is (%hesitation%) how is the laboral world
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 43.05 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion is one of the best thing that one student can do when they are studying yet
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 29.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the next the next picture shows the shows the the stages people the next picture the next picture shows the stages people need to good through when they go to travel by airplane
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057 29.14 37.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first all you have to get the airport and make your check in
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057 37.16 43.46 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that the you have to to go to document control

SI114J-00057-P50019 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 8.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> technology offer us a lot of tools to improve our way to learn
SI114J-00057-P50019 1 SI114J-00057 8.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one of them is that we can (u-) we can look for all the information using internet as we can look for examples in videos
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 12.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> face to face is the best way to learn because you can look your professor and you can concentrate best
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057 12.71 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in this way you have not distractors
SI114J-00057-P50021 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the group projects give us the opportunity to learn to work in teams to use all the abilities of one of each one of the members on in a team
SI114J-00057-P50022 1 SI114J-00057 0.00 8.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> attending lectures by yourself in my opinion it's best because you can pause when you need
SI114J-00057-P50022 1 SI114J-00057 8.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> instead when you are attending (le-) lectures with other people you cannot do that

SI114J-00057-P50023 1 SI114J-00057 14.23 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> for example in my own experience i learn best when i am listening

SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 9.90 14.98 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is to one hour to barcelona (%hesitation%) to half an hour to the to the beach
SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 14.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's a nice place
SI114J-00206-P10006 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 9.52 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in holiday i enjoy staying with friends and going to the mountains sometimes to the beach
SI114J-00206-P10006 1 SI114J-00206 9.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoying in general the nature and without (%hesitation%) obligations without (%hesitation%) club
SI114J-00206-P10007 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 5.68 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my close family maybe with my mother
SI114J-00206-P10007 1 SI114J-00206 5.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my (don-) in my second close family maybe with my brother in law
SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 7.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am not sure but one possibility of job is as a teacher
SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206 7.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is the one of my favorite jobs now
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that one (ad-) advantage is that (%hesitation%) while you are working you are learning what is the life and the same time you are studying of course
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 15.50 28.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that maybe you you are too much busy working and studying at the same time than you can turn a little stressed
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 28.71 35.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and is this is (%hesitation%) this isn't a good thing for the healthy
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 35.86 43.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that is a good idea do the the both things at the same time working and studying
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 43.56 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because (%hesitation%) working you can learn a lot of things that you can't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you can't learn while working
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 13.49 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) for to travelling by airplane first you must arrive to the airport by car by train or by coach
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 13.49 18.05 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then when you are here you must check in
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 18.05 24.84 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after check in you must pass the document control where you need your passport
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 24.84 40.85 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after pass the document control you must pass the security tunnel where you can where you can you are you must (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) leave the some things that are dangerous
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 40.85 48.33 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after the security control you must wait for the boarding moment
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 48.33 54.05 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then while you can take (%hesitation%) some lunch or coffee when you are boarding
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 54.05 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after you board you can fly to your destination
SI114J-00206-P50019 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think that the technology can can improve the study because you can find (%hesitation%) faster (%hesitation%) in the information and at the same time you can stay in connecting with (oth-) with other bit of people
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 3.53 <o,Q5,A2,P5> me too i think the same
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 3.53 15.16 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think that the face to face you can you are more (%hesitation%) more interested at with the person with them
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 15.16 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> and you can (%hesitation%) interpretate the the non verbal
SI114J-00206-P50021 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> with group projects the people can improve develop (%hesitation%) the the past the patience the the quiet listening and thinking (%hesitation%) more deep and the communication more efficient
SI114J-00206-P50022 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> in my case i think that it's better (%hesitation%) reading alone because i prefer the silent and (%hesitation%) the quietness and the calm
SI114J-00206-P50023 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 10.77 <o,Q4,A2,P5> it's important because not all the people have the possibility to to to have the all facilities
SI114J-00206-P50023 1 SI114J-00206 10.77 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> then we must to to give all the modern facilities (th-) to to to all the students to
SI114J-00212-P10005 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 7.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time is summer coz it's hot you can spend a lot of time outside
SI114J-00212-P10005 1 SI114J-00212 7.95 16.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00212-P10005 1 SI114J-00212 16.43 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and such a good season for me
SI114J-00212-P10006 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 7.29 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that really matters to me to to inform myself about what is happening in the world
SI114J-00212-P10006 1 SI114J-00212 7.29 16.24 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think that's really important to be to be aware of yeah what what what's happening around to me
SI114J-00212-P10006 1 SI114J-00212 16.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i really enjoy listening to radio in the morning
SI114J-00212-P10007 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 14.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) what i preferred when i was a child was playing with little cars and imagine (%hesitation%) a kind of city with homes buildings schools
SI114J-00212-P10007 1 SI114J-00212 14.43 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) i was i was a creative kid i think
SI114J-00212-P10008 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 9.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really hope to to have the opportunity to live abroad coz i think it's an incredible human experience
SI114J-00212-P10008 1 SI114J-00212 9.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for instance i'd like to to go to america on the west coast in a city like san francisco and just enjoying
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 27.64 <o,Q5,B2,P3> main assets have a period of internship during your during your university it's that you can realise all the work you're dreaming for is and you can confront your ideas to the reality of the the work market
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 27.64 39.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> plus i think it's a good way to to to discover new new work and you can share with your colleague
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 39.31 46.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you can learn from yourself and i think that's really really important that's really relevant
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 46.30 50.90 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (a-) actually i i don't see lot of disadvantages
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 50.90 53.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> there are there are not drawback
SI114J-00212-P30017 1 SI114J-00212 53.34 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion that really relevant to propose internship to students
SI114J-00212-P40018 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 21.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> according to this graph we can see that the first site music now start with a big advance but until seven days we can see (%hesitation%) just a a fail
SI114J-00212-P40018 1 SI114J-00212 21.06 56.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) but the tunes net it was the worst at the first day and after five days we we can observe like (%hesitation%) an incredible increase of of the of the visits on the website comparing to the yellow site who which would be the totally opposite
SI114J-00212-P40018 1 SI114J-00212 56.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it just fell up
SI114J-00212-P50019 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 5.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> get the problem with very careful which other
SI114J-00212-P50019 1 SI114J-00212 5.87 11.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are able to understand their needs and their problem
SI114J-00212-P50019 1 SI114J-00212 11.21 14.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they communicate a lot with their peer
SI114J-00212-P50019 1 SI114J-00212 14.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think it they that that's a good leader to to very communicate
SI114J-00212-P50020 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 8.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the the main issue (%hesitation%) that you have so much so much work to to do everything
SI114J-00212-P50020 1 SI114J-00212 8.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and plus i think i i am deeply convince that having a small team can create (%hesitation%) anxiousty and problems
SI114J-00212-P50021 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 16.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they they can be disagree but i think that's important and really relevant to to have disagree in a group coz you have to to explain your opinion and advocate for you for your ideas
SI114J-00212-P50021 1 SI114J-00212 16.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think that's a good exercise to to
SI114J-00212-P50022 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 11.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i (th-) i think the core of of a team is working together but doesn't matter if you if you work face to face or if you if you work at home for instance
SI114J-00212-P50022 1 SI114J-00212 11.73 16.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you you you just have to really (re-) communicate
SI114J-00212-P50022 1 SI114J-00212 16.55 17.90 <o,Q5,B2,P5> explain what you do
SI114J-00212-P50022 1 SI114J-00212 17.90 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> explain what you attempt to
SI114J-00212-P50023 1 SI114J-00212 0.00 12.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm deeply convinced that you can do a better work if you share your opinion and your ideas with coworkers
SI114J-00212-P50023 1 SI114J-00212 12.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i'm not i i'm not sure that people working alone are bad at work
SI114J-00224-P10005 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 4.45 <o,Q5,B2,P1> interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00224-P10005 1 SI114J-00224 4.45 16.54 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i enjoy because i enjoy travelling so the best way to to going travelling is knowing about the the other cultures
SI114J-00224-P10005 1 SI114J-00224 16.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so it's the best way
SI114J-00224-P10006 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 8.91 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy hiking reading studying and spending time with my family
SI114J-00224-P10006 1 SI114J-00224 8.91 15.93 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and well my free time i try to enjoy a lot
SI114J-00224-P10006 1 SI114J-00224 15.93 18.74 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so a lot of hobbies i have
SI114J-00224-P10006 1 SI114J-00224 18.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and work out
SI114J-00224-P10007 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 10.45 <o,Q5,B2,P1> obviously the the best way to improve my english is travelling abroad where to countries where they speak english
SI114J-00224-P10007 1 SI114J-00224 10.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but (%hesitation%) it's impossible to to travel all the whole year so studying
SI114J-00224-P10008 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 5.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'd like to to paint and to draw
SI114J-00224-P10008 1 SI114J-00224 5.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) however it's difficult so i'm studying the history of art (%hesitation%) as i can understand the the the painting
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 12.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i'm going to (%hesitation%) to speak about if (%hesitation%) all students university students should do part time jobs while while they are studying
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 12.64 19.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) which is are which are the the main advantage
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 19.66 32.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the main advantage is obviously they they can get (%hesitation%) money for money to pay their their study their studies their studies
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 32.38 46.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a part time job (%hesitation%) give more independence and allows to to be in contact with real job
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 46.30 55.01 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) however one of the disadvantage is (%hesitation%) they have less (%hesitation%) free time to study
SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 55.01 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's highly recommended to to
SI114J-00224-P40018 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 5.22 <o,Q5,B1,P4> going to explain (%hesitation%) how pollution cause acid rain
SI114J-00224-P40018 1 SI114J-00224 5.22 24.19 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the (%hesitation%) the pollution causes caused by (%hesitation%) factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) rise to the to the to the air (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) are carried by by by winds
SI114J-00224-P40018 1 SI114J-00224 24.19 36.97 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) particles (%hesitation%) can fall on the on the earth (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) as dust
SI114J-00224-P40018 1 SI114J-00224 36.97 41.97 <o,Q5,B1,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00224-P40018 1 SI114J-00224 41.97 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) when when cloud (%hesitation%) water (%hesitation%) when the the clouds (%hesitation%) when it rains (%hesitation%) the water (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) wear (%hesitation%) wears (%hesitation%) these these (%hesitation%) particle
SI114J-00224-P50019 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the the advice i would give is to to eat (%hesitation%) mostly fruit and fresh vegetables (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) give up (%hesitation%) fast food and fat (%hesitation%) food that (%hesitation%) can damage our (%hesitation%) our health (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00224-P50020 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 15.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my opinion (%hesitation%) drinking water is (%hesitation%) is the best way to to to drink because is the is (%hesitation%) the healthiest (%hesitation%) drink (%hesitation%) you can you can get
SI114J-00224-P50020 1 SI114J-00224 15.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) so this affects your your health (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00224-P50021 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (ercise-) (%hesitation%) is very important for our health
SI114J-00224-P50021 1 SI114J-00224 4.88 11.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) every day maybe we can we can have (%hesitation%) enough free time
SI114J-00224-P50021 1 SI114J-00224 11.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however (%hesitation%) three or four times a (%hesitation%) per week is very is essential to to fit
SI114J-00224-P50022 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 3.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think is better to to sleep eight hour
SI114J-00224-P50022 1 SI114J-00224 3.98 18.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however (%hesitation%) sometime is impossible to to do it because our (%hesitation%) busy style life (%hesitation%) don't (%hesitation%) (d-) doesn't allowed (%hesitation%) to to sleep eight (hou-) hours
SI114J-00224-P50022 1 SI114J-00224 18.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however we should (i-)
SI114J-00224-P50023 1 SI114J-00224 0.00 5.91 <o,Q4,B2,P5> technology can have a positive or negatives (%hesitation%) effects
SI114J-00224-P50023 1 SI114J-00224 5.91 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it depends on the use we we we use the the technology (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) could be very bad for our (%hesitation%) (ou-)
SI114J-00233-P10005 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00233-P10005 1 SI114J-00233 4.34 17.24 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and personally i did (%hesitation%) study abroad in ireland and i met a lot of people from different countries (%hesitation%) especially from spain and poland and germany
SI114J-00233-P10005 1 SI114J-00233 17.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i am very interested in learning from the cultures
SI114J-00233-P10006 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 15.87 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending my free time with my family watching movies or or series also by making exercise with them hiking or walking around the house
SI114J-00233-P10006 1 SI114J-00233 15.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and yes
SI114J-00233-P10007 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is by watching movies or series also by reading books and (nor-) and normals so that i can learn my skills in english
SI114J-00233-P10008 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 9.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think i would learn to read more and read faster because i am not that fast at reading
SI114J-00233-P10008 1 SI114J-00233 9.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i would like to learn that to read more books and to learn more about the cultures of the world
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 1.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> good afternoon
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 1.62 9.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> today we're going to talk about if the university students should do a part job part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 9.41 19.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying is that the students gain the responsibility of their actions
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 19.65 32.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> also they gain the skill of organising more their time and also (%hesitation%) the skill of working in teams and cooperate with each other
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 32.66 45.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> a disadvantage is that they have not much time to study so an effect is that the grades decline and they can sleep in class
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 45.92 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my own opinion i think it's a good way of the students to learn (%hesitation%) teamwork and organise skills in their life
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 1.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> good afternoon
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 1.86 6.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> today we're going to talk about how the acid rain is created
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 6.97 13.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first the factors the initial factors are the factories and vehicles vehicles
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 13.66 16.57 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they create pollution to the air
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 16.57 22.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this pollution create the acid particles in smoke
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 22.09 31.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is carried by the wind and some of these particles fall in dust and some of these particles stay in the clouds
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 31.61 42.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these clouds (%hesitation%) clouds water with the life cycle of the water creates the acid particles in the rain and the snow
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 42.27 49.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and these is these particles are the ones that damage the environment
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 49.27 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that is why we need to change the factors vehicles and the factories to decline acid rain
SI114J-00233-P50019 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 17.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all they need to delete every candy they have in their house so that they can eat and start eating good food and to have healthy life like fruit and vegetables
SI114J-00233-P50019 1 SI114J-00233 17.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and start doing a menu
SI114J-00233-P50020 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 7.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider that drinking water is a good form of starting a hal healthy lifestyle
SI114J-00233-P50020 1 SI114J-00233 7.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> drinking two litres per day is a good amount of water to the hydratated and to be happy in your day
SI114J-00233-P50021 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 7.27 <o,Q5,B2,P5> doing exercise is a good way of starting a healthy (li-) living
SI114J-00233-P50021 1 SI114J-00233 7.27 14.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can do exercise three or four times a week not in expensive like every day
SI114J-00233-P50021 1 SI114J-00233 14.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but three or four hours a week walking around or hiking it's a good
SI114J-00233-P50022 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 8.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider that eight hours sleeping in the night is a good way of starting a healthy lifestyle

SI114J-00233-P50023 1 SI114J-00233 0.00 15.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider technology has impact in a bad form to the healthy lifestyle because many people are now watching their cellphones all the time instead of going outside and doing exercise
SI114J-00233-P50023 1 SI114J-00233 15.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that's bad because
SI114J-00243-P10005 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 3.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i am interested really
SI114J-00243-P10005 1 SI114J-00243 3.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm into it
SI114J-00243-P10006 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 13.10 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i don't have much free time but (%hesitation%) i draw sometimes walk around the city go sightseeing or just visit museums
SI114J-00243-P10006 1 SI114J-00243 13.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i adore watching films and movie (%hesitation%) films and series
SI114J-00243-P10007 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 8.96 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i think (%hesitation%) about (%hesitation%) with diving into the context of english language
SI114J-00243-P10007 1 SI114J-00243 8.96 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i mean watching (%hesitation%) serials and films really helps me improve my language
SI114J-00243-P10008 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 6.69 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i would like to take up sport classes
SI114J-00243-P10008 1 SI114J-00243 6.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i think (%hesitation%) like this discipline really would help me
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 7.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's (%hesitation%) an (%hesitation%) opinion that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 7.59 13.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so there are some obvious (%hesitation%) advantages to this (%hesitation%) opinion
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 13.20 18.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) first of all they would (%hesitation%) would get better in financial literacy
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 18.93 22.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> they would know how to deal with the money they earn
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 22.92 34.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) they would (%hesitation%) become more independent from their parents as a (%hesitation%) great (%hesitation%) advantage (%hesitation%) to this (%hesitation%) thing
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 34.17 45.13 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) so however there are some drawbacks (%hesitation%) to this opinion and (%hesitation%) it all needed to lack of time for them to study at school
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 45.13 49.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) and i think is (%hesitation%) it can it could be crucial for them
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 49.22 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) i (%hesitation%) personally believe that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) part time jobs would only (%hesitation%) give (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 6.20 <o,Q5,C,P4> so i'm gonna give a presentation about acid rain and how it affects the environment
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 6.20 15.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> so it basically starts with (%hesitation%) by vehicles and factories releasing emissions (%hesitation%) into the (%hesitation%) environment
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 15.30 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it all comes (%hesitation%) in smoke
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 18.12 32.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and (%hesitation%) acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and are releasing (%hesitation%) into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 32.84 49.69 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) these particles that are in the that are mixed with the (cl-) cloud (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) they settles (%hesitation%) to the ground and forests (%hesitation%) with (%hesitation%) rain and snow
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 49.69 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) this forests (%hesitation%) are suffering from acid rain
SI114J-00243-P50019 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would recommend these people to listen to what their gut feelings (%hesitation%) tell them because (%hesitation%) they would know what food (re-) they really want and not their brain but their body wants to eat
SI114J-00243-P50020 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is essential to drink lots of water on daily basis because our body consists of water on eighty percent and (%hesitation%) it just would really (%hesitation%) start their metabolism to work better
SI114J-00243-P50021 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 10.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is major for people (%hesitation%) to do little exercises every day like after waking up and before they go to sleep i guess too
SI114J-00243-P50021 1 SI114J-00243 10.38 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00243-P50022 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree with the opinion that sleeping around (%hesitation%) eight hours a day is a key habit because if you don't sleep enough you would (%hesitation%) be tired and (%hesitation%) won't be productive at all
SI114J-00243-P50023 1 SI114J-00243 0.00 16.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's quite (question-) a questionable opinion because technologies truly helps (%hesitation%) help people to make their lives easier but (%hesitation%) but not always
SI114J-00243-P50023 1 SI114J-00243 16.06 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> they can harm health too i guess
SI114J-00307-P10005 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 11.55 <o,Q5,B1,P1> where i live i have more pantries and we have the best food on my on my country spain
SI114J-00307-P10005 1 SI114J-00307 11.55 15.91 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's paella and it's a wonderful rice
SI114J-00307-P10005 1 SI114J-00307 15.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> another important point is the language spanish
SI114J-00307-P10006 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 14.11 <o,Q5,B1,P1> on holidays i enjoy going with my family to the beach or with my friend to play football handball or another sport because it's incredible and wonderful playing with your friends
SI114J-00307-P10006 1 SI114J-00307 14.11 18.74 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i also play video games with my brother
SI114J-00307-P10006 1 SI114J-00307 18.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's wonderful
SI114J-00307-P10007 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 11.89 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i personally think that i spend more time with my brother because my father is always working and this is terrible
SI114J-00307-P10007 1 SI114J-00307 11.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> because if they are working all day i can't see every day and this is a terrible problem
SI114J-00307-P10008 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 12.77 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future if i have the possibility i want to do nursing to help people or a policeman because they can help people
SI114J-00307-P10008 1 SI114J-00307 12.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and it's wonderful and impressive to (he-) help people and gain money
SI114J-00307-P30017 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 15.36 <o,Q5,B1,P3> students should get jobs to pay for their university studies from my point of view because the advantage of this are that you are prepares for the future and you can get money
SI114J-00307-P30017 1 SI114J-00307 15.36 35.81 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the disadvantages of this situation are that if they would prefer to (%hesitation%) to play video games or another thing they cannot do it because they have to do this jobs
SI114J-00307-P30017 1 SI114J-00307 35.81 45.97 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but in my opinion i personally think that is better to do a part job not a totally job that complete all day
SI114J-00307-P30017 1 SI114J-00307 45.97 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> because i think that university is to enjoy your life and then to prepare for your future and work and get money for your family because is essential
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 4.35 <o,Q5,B1,P4> what you have to do for travelling by airplane
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 4.35 7.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first you have to travel to the airport
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 7.11 12.79 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then we have to check our documents in the document control with policeman
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 12.79 26.74 <o,Q5,B1,P4> it is essential that that all the document will be correct because if is not correct you have you can't you cannot go by airplane
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 26.74 32.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the security because you (ha-) you have not (mate-) dangerous material
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 32.88 37.68 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then you can wait wait in a restaurant or go to the toilet
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 37.68 43.16 <o,Q5,B1,P4> is essential go to the toilet because in airplane is difficult than other sites
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 43.16 56.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you have to board the airplane and preparent for for the plane because many people complained that had problems on the airplanes
SI114J-00307-P40018 1 SI114J-00307 56.88 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this is essential to just stay (consc-)
SI114J-00307-P50019 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 16.36 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for from my point of view students can't study more efficient with technology because they can use google by computer because they can find more information than in a library
SI114J-00307-P50019 1 SI114J-00307 16.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this essential for for a student
SI114J-00307-P50020 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 18.48 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i personally think that study face to face is better than studying online because you are attending face to face more than in a computer because in a computer you you can stay playing with the mobile phone
SI114J-00307-P50020 1 SI114J-00307 18.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is a problem

SI114J-00307-P50021 1 SI114J-00307 7.47 15.95 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is essential for the future because nowadays companies are working in groups

SI114J-00307-P50023 1 SI114J-00307 0.00 14.41 <o,Q5,B1,P5> from my point of view is the most important to have learning facilities because at university if you not have a computer or another technology you cannot learn more than other students
SI114J-00307-P50023 1 SI114J-00307 14.41 18.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is a difficult in others countries
SI114J-00307-P50023 1 SI114J-00307 18.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is (essenti-)
SI114J-00358-P10005 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 6.37 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interested in know about other countries
SI114J-00358-P10005 1 SI114J-00358 6.37 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i'm in love with barcelona and i'm in love with catalonia and spain too

SI114J-00358-P10007 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that the best way to improve my english is watching films in in original version for example in english and to meet some new people that are native speakers of english and yeah

SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 10.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i'm going to talk about university students if they should do part times while they are studying
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 10.16 32.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they working too is that they (%hesitation%) they were earn money to to spend it in in her free time in their free time
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 32.94 47.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and but maybe (%hesitation%) the (disa-) the disadvantage is that they don't have enough time to study for example during a week that they have an exam
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 47.06 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion is very important to work in a file of your own study to earn experience and practise
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 8.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i am going to talk about how the pollution goes acid rain
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 8.80 21.76 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the pollution of factories and vehicles up with the smoke forming acid particles
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 21.76 28.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then this acid particles that are carried by wind can do two things
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 28.34 34.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) it can be mixed with cloud water or fall as dust
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 34.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if they mix with cloud water then with when the cloud collide fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are in the ground
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 7.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it's very important to have habits in your eating
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358 7.26 17.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example you have to have a schedule with what is what are you (s-) eating in the evening or in the morning
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358 17.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that is very important
SI114J-00358-P50020 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 9.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is known that we are practically eighty percent of water in our body
SI114J-00358-P50020 1 SI114J-00358 9.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important to drink so much water in our daily and during all the whole day
SI114J-00358-P50021 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 7.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it's not necessary to do exercise every day during the week
SI114J-00358-P50021 1 SI114J-00358 7.75 13.51 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it is important to doing exercise for have a good healthy
SI114J-00358-P50021 1 SI114J-00358 13.51 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) as less (%hesitation%) two or three days a week is important
SI114J-00358-P50022 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 12.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it's important to sleep at less six or seven hours but i think that it's not necessary to sleep eight (ho-) eight hours
SI114J-00358-P50022 1 SI114J-00358 12.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) if you have a good sleeping it's not (necess-)
SI114J-00358-P50023 1 SI114J-00358 0.00 6.81 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that for some people (%hesitation%) it can be affect negatively
SI114J-00358-P50023 1 SI114J-00358 6.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if you if you want you can you can have this technology and compare to

SI114J-00381-P10007 1 SI114J-00381 17.17 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love her and i love to spend time with her
SI114J-00381-P10008 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 4.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really would like to be a potter
SI114J-00381-P10008 1 SI114J-00381 4.04 17.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> a potter (%hesitation%) because i really enjoy work with my hands and don't be don't spend so much time from (%hesitation%) computer
SI114J-00381-P10008 1 SI114J-00381 17.25 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> is what i really want to do
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 17.09 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's very common that students in the university have a job to pay their fees their expensive (%hesitation%) during the course
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 17.09 21.29 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but let's see the pros and cons
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 21.29 28.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> first it's true that when you have a job you have more resource
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 28.43 30.08 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you can pay more things
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 30.08 34.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you can live more (i-) (i-)
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 34.78 50.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but by contrary if you spend a lot of time at your job maybe you can't assist to your class or be focus in your studies
SI114J-00381-P30017 1 SI114J-00381 50.52 61.09 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my humble opinion i think if you can afford it is better that you focus in your studies
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 10.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> the diagram show the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 10.62 25.90 <o,Q5,C,P4> in the diagram let's start (%hesitation%) you need to arrive the the airport by train or bus or with your own car
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 25.90 29.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you need to check in
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 29.09 38.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> the following you should pass the document control and security
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 38.30 53.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> well once you are free you just have to wait sit down in a cafe or go to the toilets and wait for the departure
SI114J-00381-P40018 1 SI114J-00381 53.36 61.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> then when you are get in board just relax and enjoy your flight
SI114J-00381-P50019 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 10.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> nowadays is obvious that technologies may be one of the the main results for students
SI114J-00381-P50019 1 SI114J-00381 10.49 20.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can use it for mainly internet to to research any anything they need
SI114J-00381-P50020 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 11.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) face to face give you the opportunity to ask anything that you are not sure about any issue you are student
SI114J-00381-P50020 1 SI114J-00381 11.97 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) i think in my opinion study by your own is (si-) really good
SI114J-00381-P50021 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can develop skills (%hesitation%) social skills communication skills (%hesitation%) working on team (%hesitation%) how to share any ideas with other people
SI114J-00381-P50022 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 2.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah absolutely
SI114J-00381-P50022 1 SI114J-00381 2.39 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> when you go to (%hesitation%) very important lectures is not just what they are trying to communicate is the way is is the the the the (ch-) the character of of the the lecturer
SI114J-00381-P50023 1 SI114J-00381 0.00 10.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> any facilities that the university of any institution may provide you (%hesitation%) could be
SI114J-00381-P50023 1 SI114J-00381 10.68 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's very important to improve your way the way that you are learning
SI114J-00395-P10005 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 14.01 <o,Q5,C,P1> i am really interested because i'm studying architecture and i always pay attention how can i be respectful with my buildings to the environment
SI114J-00395-P10005 1 SI114J-00395 14.01 16.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> so it's really important
SI114J-00395-P10005 1 SI114J-00395 16.29 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i really interested in the
SI114J-00395-P10006 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 12.15 <o,Q5,C,P1> we we enjoy going out to the restaurants drinking some good beer and eating some good tasty food

SI114J-00395-P10007 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 3.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really similar to my father
SI114J-00395-P10007 1 SI114J-00395 3.54 11.05 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it it's not easy to say that but we are really similar
SI114J-00395-P10007 1 SI114J-00395 11.05 18.77 <o,Q5,C,P1> we also do the same things in different ways but in the ending we are really similar
SI114J-00395-P10007 1 SI114J-00395 18.77 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so it's (unc-)
SI114J-00395-P10008 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 3.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to live near to the desert
SI114J-00395-P10008 1 SI114J-00395 3.97 17.32 <o,Q4,C,P1> i don't know why but (%hesitation%) how much the much i studied architecture i'm more like the buildings and houses build in the desert
SI114J-00395-P10008 1 SI114J-00395 17.32 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i i really love the desert
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 7.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think it's really important for everyone to do some exercise along the week
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 7.58 18.44 <o,Q5,C,P3> but the bad thing is that we in our everyday time we don't have a lot of time for exercise
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 18.44 20.17 <o,Q5,C,P3> we're really busy
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 20.17 34.85 <o,Q5,C,P3> so so have some time in our school or colleges to do some fitness is really good for everyone
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 34.85 42.97 <o,Q5,C,P3> and it will help to keep our health in good situation
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 42.97 46.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it's really good for everyone
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 46.12 57.40 <o,Q5,C,P3> the bad thing is that you (ha-) have to go to the college with extra clothes to change when you finish your fitness classes
SI114J-00395-P30017 1 SI114J-00395 57.40 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> but the good thing is your health is (be-)
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 10.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> i'm really glad that this question is from honey because i am all for honey and i know really well how honey is made
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 10.61 13.70 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all you have a bee
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 13.70 19.27 <o,Q5,C,P4> bee goes in the nature and bee sees a flower
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 19.27 24.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> he goes to the flower and takes a (n-) nectar from the flower
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 24.12 29.28 <o,Q5,C,P4> he keeps the nectar to the to the house
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 29.28 35.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> there there the bee makes from the nectar a honey
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 35.77 45.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> then the beekeeper goes to the beehives and takes all the honey
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 45.38 49.47 <o,Q5,C,P4> then they put the honey into the jar
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 49.47 53.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> the jar goes straight to the shop
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 53.12 57.53 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you go to your local shop
SI114J-00395-P40018 1 SI114J-00395 57.53 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and there you can find
SI114J-00395-P50019 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 7.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in the first place they have to choose the language they want to learn
SI114J-00395-P50019 1 SI114J-00395 7.22 16.26 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they want to learn italian they have to choose country where the local people speaks that language
SI114J-00395-P50019 1 SI114J-00395 16.26 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the most important thing is the language you want to
SI114J-00395-P50020 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 12.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if you study in another language (%hesitation%) that is not yours it's becomes easier to you to learn that language faster
SI114J-00395-P50020 1 SI114J-00395 12.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's a really good thing to you to learn a new language
SI114J-00395-P50021 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 13.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all if you never had studied in another place where you had born it will be really difficult if you don't speak that language of that place
SI114J-00395-P50021 1 SI114J-00395 13.00 16.19 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that is one of the things
SI114J-00395-P50021 1 SI114J-00395 16.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and another one is that you don't know anybody in
SI114J-00395-P50022 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 1.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's easy
SI114J-00395-P50022 1 SI114J-00395 1.74 7.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to meet new friends from (%hesitation%) the place there are you studying
SI114J-00395-P50022 1 SI114J-00395 7.23 10.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> then you meet local people
SI114J-00395-P50022 1 SI114J-00395 10.72 17.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they teach you and show you what they are supposed to do
SI114J-00395-P50022 1 SI114J-00395 17.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> then they are living in that (pla-)
SI114J-00395-P50023 1 SI114J-00395 0.00 5.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah that is true (%hesitation%) because you live alone
SI114J-00395-P50023 1 SI114J-00395 5.73 13.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> your family is not living in that place so you have to learn to do everything by yourself
SI114J-00395-P50023 1 SI114J-00395 13.59 18.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to cook you have to clean your (%hesitation%) house
SI114J-00395-P50023 1 SI114J-00395 18.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's not

SI114J-00397-P10005 1 SI114J-00397 13.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it takes twenty minutes to go by by bicycle
SI114J-00397-P10006 1 SI114J-00397 0.00 5.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> usually i go shopping with my friends
SI114J-00397-P10006 1 SI114J-00397 5.23 11.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) going shopping and talking with my friends reduce my stress
SI114J-00397-P10006 1 SI114J-00397 11.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) going shopping is good way to spend time on holiday

SI114J-00397-P30017 1 SI114J-00397 0.00 15.95 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) i think all students should not get jobs but they do (%hesitation%) part time jobs i (%hesitation%) because there are one advantage and disadvantage
SI114J-00397-P30017 1 SI114J-00397 15.95 24.89 <o,Q5,B1,P3> an advantage is (%hesitation%) they can know how how hard to create money to live
SI114J-00397-P30017 1 SI114J-00397 24.89 36.97 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and disadvantage is (%hesitation%) their their jobs is not working just studying
SI114J-00397-P30017 1 SI114J-00397 36.97 52.59 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so like doing jobs (%hesitation%) so (%hesitation%) it is really hard to create create the time to study if if they if they work if they do the job
SI114J-00397-P30017 1 SI114J-00397 52.59 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so i think they do the part time jobs

SI114J-00400-P10007 1 SI114J-00400 8.65 18.91 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but the thing i really love the most is (%hesitation%) go shopping with her because we can spend hours and hours just browsing at the shops
SI114J-00400-P10007 1 SI114J-00400 18.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and is really fun
SI114J-00400-P10008 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the job i will i would like to to have is to be a a teacher a biologist teacher and for this reason nowadays i'm doing a master like a master to be a teacher in the future
SI114J-00400-P30017 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 26.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion for the students i think it's a really good idea to get a job for just to pay for their university studies because i think that (ha-) get a job could be a really good way to be more responsible and to know how important it is to get a job and how difficult it is to earn some money
SI114J-00400-P30017 1 SI114J-00400 26.46 38.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand it's true that if the student have (%hesitation%) a job they have less time to go class or to study
SI114J-00400-P30017 1 SI114J-00400 38.17 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but finally my opinion i think it's a really good idea just get a half time job to earn some money to get more responsibility and to know how how do you do wait about the future and the job that you could have maybe in the future
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 9.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if you want to travel by airplane first thing you have to do is go to the airport
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 9.30 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can travel by car and also you can get the train or maybe a a bus
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 16.38 25.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then when you arrive at the at the airport the first thing you have to do is go to do the check in
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 25.22 29.57 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to left (%hesitation%) your luggage
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 29.57 33.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you can take your ticket your document ticket
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 33.80 40.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to go to the document control and then you have to pass the security control
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 40.27 49.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they are going to check your luggage and all your document and also your ticket to get the airplane
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 49.06 56.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then if you have some free time you can wait at the at the coffee so maybe you can go shopping to the duty free one
SI114J-00400-P40018 1 SI114J-00400 56.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then when is time to board you have to find
SI114J-00400-P50019 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 14.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the good thing about the technology to study is that you can check all the things that you maybe wrote in the class and find more and more information about one topic
SI114J-00400-P50019 1 SI114J-00400 14.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and then you can know more and have more knowledge
SI114J-00400-P50020 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 2.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think so
SI114J-00400-P50020 1 SI114J-00400 2.02 11.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think if you are learning face to face with your teacher you can ask him all the question you can (a-) you can have
SI114J-00400-P50020 1 SI114J-00400 11.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also (%hesitation%) the teacher can borrow you some advice or some
SI114J-00400-P50021 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 14.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's the a really important thing to to work in project in groups project sorry because is really important to know how do you work with anothers
SI114J-00400-P50021 1 SI114J-00400 14.44 19.14 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to to spend time with other people in the future job
SI114J-00400-P50021 1 SI114J-00400 19.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and this is (p-)
SI114J-00400-P50022 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think is more effective because if you just read alone you don't speak with other and you can't hear the others' opinion
SI114J-00400-P50022 1 SI114J-00400 12.77 18.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think this is better for our knowledge and also for for our study
SI114J-00400-P50022 1 SI114J-00400 18.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because is (re-)
SI114J-00400-P50023 1 SI114J-00400 0.00 13.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we are not all the same and is is really important to to give learning facilities because maybe some people need this
SI114J-00400-P50023 1 SI114J-00400 13.76 16.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and is really good for them
SI114J-00400-P50023 1 SI114J-00400 16.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> see is the really good (thi-)
SI114J-00426-P10005 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 7.53 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i have a deep interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00426-P10005 1 SI114J-00426 7.53 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's something that catch my attention and i think that i can learn a lot about it
SI114J-00426-P10006 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) being an export (%hesitation%) sportive person sorry i can say that i love go running and jogging with my friends and with my children also
SI114J-00426-P10007 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> to improve my english i think that the best option is to listen and to speak with other people (%hesitation%) even though it's hard for me to do it
SI114J-00426-P10008 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 13.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) from since i am i'm a child i have wanted (%hesitation%) learn show i think learn to sew
SI114J-00426-P10008 1 SI114J-00426 13.50 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to make my own clothes
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 7.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i see the advantage other way the disadvantages
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 7.58 18.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as the first one i can say that (%hesitation%) working while you are studying you can learn other skills that are impossible to catch up in class
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 18.67 30.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in addition to this you can make contact with friends and with other people ca ga so you can enrich your university experience
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 30.55 40.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand (%hesitation%) if you are working at the same time that you are studying you have less time to to dedicate to your exams
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 40.92 51.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as well as that (%hesitation%) usually the work schedules are bad and you by tired
SI114J-00426-P30017 1 SI114J-00426 51.05 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00426-P40018 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 9.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid particle are from the factory cames from the factories and the vehicles
SI114J-00426-P40018 1 SI114J-00426 9.34 18.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) since they are a good deal small it's extremely difficult to see
SI114J-00426-P40018 1 SI114J-00426 18.34 36.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so from my view this is the reason because many people don't pay attention to them and we are not aware about the relevance in order to avoid the pollution and other (%hesitation%) natural issues
SI114J-00426-P40018 1 SI114J-00426 36.71 51.12 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) they travel in mixed in the fumes (%hesitation%) so that they end end up in our woods (%hesitation%) as well as in the water

SI114J-00426-P50019 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 14.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to start with i would say them that soda is something dangerous that can that they should avoid in order to improve their health and eating habits
SI114J-00426-P50019 1 SI114J-00426 14.50 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because it's (%hesitation%) something (%hesitation%) really
SI114J-00426-P50020 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 17.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> bearing in mind that (%hesitation%) our body is almost water is something necessary (%hesitation%) in and (un-) unavoidable to us drinking water
SI114J-00426-P50020 1 SI114J-00426 17.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> although it's difficult to drink
SI114J-00426-P50021 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 2.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely
SI114J-00426-P50021 1 SI114J-00426 2.17 19.15 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however (%hesitation%) you have you should remember that doing exercise is not only going to the gym but also you can doing exercises while you are doing shopping or cleaning the house for example
SI114J-00426-P50021 1 SI114J-00426 19.15 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because you
SI114J-00426-P50022 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 10.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> how many hours you need to be sleeped are different from each person to others
SI114J-00426-P50022 1 SI114J-00426 10.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that (%hesitation%) although it's important to have a good rest and to be patient is different
SI114J-00426-P50023 1 SI114J-00426 0.00 6.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> at this point i have a mixture of feelings and thoughts
SI114J-00426-P50023 1 SI114J-00426 6.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i would like to say that (%hesitation%) although technology is something positive in general people try tends to use (%hesitation%) badly
SI114J-00443-P10005 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 4.57 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i have said i live in mallorca which is an island
SI114J-00443-P10005 1 SI114J-00443 4.57 18.59 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i like living there but it could be difficult for those people who are not (%hesitation%) are are not into it because if you want to go somewhere you need to take a plane
SI114J-00443-P10005 1 SI114J-00443 18.59 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and it's not that easy
SI114J-00443-P10006 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 9.64 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well as i live in mallorca i love going to the beach and doing things that (%hesitation%) means water
SI114J-00443-P10006 1 SI114J-00443 9.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> because i i don't like i also like (%hesitation%) having (%hesitation%) being cold but i prefer on doing things which involves the sun
SI114J-00443-P10007 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 7.02 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well that's a difficult question because i love spending (%hesitation%) time with my family all of them
SI114J-00443-P10007 1 SI114J-00443 7.02 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but if i have to choose someone i would choose my brother because we only differ by four years and we have a lot of things to talk about and some things in common that we can compare
SI114J-00443-P10008 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 7.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i was little i always wanted to be an astronaut and that's because i studied physics
SI114J-00443-P10008 1 SI114J-00443 7.62 15.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and nowadays i don't want to be an astronaut but i do like (%hesitation%) things that involves the space
SI114J-00443-P10008 1 SI114J-00443 15.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i would love to be a scientist about gravitational wave (str-)
SI114J-00443-P30017 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 42.88 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i don't agree with this statement of this question because even though it has some advantages like for example you learn how to earn your own money and you become you become more (%hesitation%) more i don't know is autonom it (al-) (%hesitation%) it also has some disadvantages such as (d-) don't having free time because you are spending your time either studying or working but not spending the money that you are earning for example
SI114J-00443-P30017 1 SI114J-00443 42.88 47.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so my opinion is clear in that case
SI114J-00443-P30017 1 SI114J-00443 47.04 49.48 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think we shouldn't
SI114J-00443-P30017 1 SI114J-00443 49.48 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and but also i think that university studies should be free for everyone so everyone has the same opportunities
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 9.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> travelling traveling by airplane is one of the most (%hesitation%) normal things to do nowadays
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 9.27 11.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all you need to go to the airport
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 11.98 20.45 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so you can go there maybe using some public transport because otherwise you need to pay (f-) for your car to stay there
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 20.45 31.22 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once there you need to do your check in (o-) (wh-) where your luggage would be (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (revis-) reviewed
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 31.22 45.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you need to go to the document control area where there are some security wires where (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) see if you have something that you (ca-) cannot enter to the plane
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 45.56 54.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then you need to wait for your flight and go on board the the plane which (c-) (%hesitation%) is usually done by groups
SI114J-00443-P40018 1 SI114J-00443 54.02 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> finally you take off with your plane and enjoy your trip
SI114J-00443-P50019 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 3.65 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can use technology in a lot of ways
SI114J-00443-P50019 1 SI114J-00443 3.65 6.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> maybe using this we can improve for example
SI114J-00443-P50019 1 SI114J-00443 6.56 10.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's a perfect way to improve your speaking
SI114J-00443-P50019 1 SI114J-00443 10.91 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> while they can also use it to do some powerpoint on other things that can learn (%hesitation%) teach them how to study more
SI114J-00443-P50020 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 15.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i agree with this statement but in fact (%hesitation%) with the covid nineteen situation i would say that learning online as it as i have done for my english classes it's a good way too
SI114J-00443-P50020 1 SI114J-00443 15.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but you need to be more conscient and try to focus more on what you do
SI114J-00443-P50021 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 5.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are a lot of skills that can be learnt (%hesitation%) working on group
SI114J-00443-P50021 1 SI114J-00443 5.05 18.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think the most important thing is to learn how to collaborate and listen to the other people because it is important if you want if you want to work with some people
SI114J-00443-P50021 1 SI114J-00443 18.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> just learn to listen
SI114J-00443-P50022 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 10.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i agree with that because if you are reading alone maybe there is something that you don't really understand but you just skip it
SI114J-00443-P50022 1 SI114J-00443 10.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> while if you are attending a lecture maybe these people who know how to do that can (%hesitation%) teach you
SI114J-00443-P50023 1 SI114J-00443 0.00 16.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think nowadays it is essential because (%hesitation%) with the new technologies it is really easy for them to make something (%hesitation%) create facilities which can help us study more effectively
SI114J-00443-P50023 1 SI114J-00443 16.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's essential and they should do that
SI114J-00483-P10005 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 15.76 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (y-) favourite time (%hesitation%) in the year are summer holidays because i have three months to relax and do other things that are not study
SI114J-00483-P10005 1 SI114J-00483 15.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i spend my summer holidays at the beach with
SI114J-00483-P10006 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 14.38 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am (ins-) interested (%hesitation%) in news because i think that it's important to know what happens in the world but (%hesitation%) in your country too
SI114J-00483-P10006 1 SI114J-00483 14.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but is true that young people (%hesitation%) specifically (%hesitation%) teenagers are
SI114J-00483-P10007 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 8.29 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i was a child i enjoyed (%hesitation%) going to the park to play with my friends
SI114J-00483-P10007 1 SI114J-00483 8.29 10.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> obviously my mother come with me
SI114J-00483-P10007 1 SI114J-00483 10.88 18.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also i remember that at weekends my family and me (%hesitation%) went to mountain

SI114J-00483-P30017 1 SI114J-00483 8.96 12.80 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i'm going to start my fourth year
SI114J-00483-P30017 1 SI114J-00483 12.80 21.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) i'm (g-) doing i'm doing my period of practical work experience
SI114J-00483-P30017 1 SI114J-00483 21.82 48.08 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) my the principal (advan-) advantage i think that (%hesitation%) is that i can learn and students (%hesitation%) can learn a lot of things that are important (%hesitation%) for their future careers and also (%hesitation%) give us (%hesitation%) a lot of experience and practical
SI114J-00483-P30017 1 SI114J-00483 48.08 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the principal disadvantage (%hesitation%) for me (a-) (%hesitation%) at least are that (%hesitation%) is that i don't have enough time
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 11.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> ok this graphs (%hesitation%) shows (%hesitation%) how much people (%hesitation%) are visiting the sites during their first week online
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 11.33 21.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> we can see that there are three (%hesitation%) music sites tunes net music now as songs for you
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 21.81 28.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> there are (%hesitation%) represented in three colours blue red and yellow
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 28.70 35.16 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and we can see that the majority of people (%hesitation%) visit (%hesitation%) music (%hesitation%) now
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 35.16 40.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so is the (famo-) is the (famo-) the most famous site
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 40.95 51.45 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) during the four first days the the (mi-) minority of people visit tunes net
SI114J-00483-P40018 1 SI114J-00483 51.45 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but (d-) during the six and the seven days (%hesitation%) the visit (%hesitation%) of this site (increa-)
SI114J-00483-P50019 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 10.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion a team leader (%hesitation%) will be able to listen the other members of the group
SI114J-00483-P50019 1 SI114J-00483 10.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> also (%hesitation%) she or he will be joyful in order to transmit their
SI114J-00483-P50020 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 16.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the main problem (%hesitation%) probably will be that there are not enough (%hesitation%) proposal or ideas for doing the job
SI114J-00483-P50020 1 SI114J-00483 16.29 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but for me it's not a problem
SI114J-00483-P50021 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's important that member of the group have different opinion (%hesitation%) because in this way they can discuss and debate and probably it will be a better solution
SI114J-00483-P50022 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 19.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i believe that it's better that the group are face to face (%hesitation%) in order to discuss the different solutions but it's not the most important thing to have a good job
SI114J-00483-P50022 1 SI114J-00483 19.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so
SI114J-00483-P50023 1 SI114J-00483 0.00 13.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i strongly believe this this affirmation because when you (%hesitation%) work alone maybe you don't think all the possibilities

SI114J-00530-P10007 1 SI114J-00530 10.00 17.23 <o,Q5,C,P1> and also she teach me a lot of things that i wouldn't learn if i talk with someone else
SI114J-00530-P10007 1 SI114J-00530 17.23 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P1> that's why i'm love enjoy time with my

SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 6.24 <o,Q4,C,P3> college students should get a job to pay for the university studies
SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 6.24 16.49 <o,Q4,C,P3> it should be the most convenient but sometimes they don't have enough time to spend in work and also study
SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 16.49 19.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> most of them fail doing both things
SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 19.75 41.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> so an advantage is that you could get more money and pay your university but the disadvantage is that you don't get your you don't get the knowledge that you should get if you dedicate all the time to study
SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 41.04 45.85 <o,Q4,C,P3> sometime it's hard to work and study at the same time
SI114J-00530-P30017 1 SI114J-00530 45.85 60.16 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also just to study is difficult because you don't know how to share your time but you know how to speak
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 6.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> what you need to do if you are going to travel in a airplane
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 6.79 11.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you have to translate (%hesitation%) to travel to the airport
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 11.80 15.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to check in your wallet
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 15.38 21.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to go to the officer and take the document control
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 21.02 25.68 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they are going to take some securities made
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 25.68 36.67 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you have to wait in the cafe or also you can go to the bathroom or just wait to your plane
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 36.67 41.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to board the airplane and just fly
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 41.20 42.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that's it
SI114J-00530-P40018 1 SI114J-00530 42.15 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> have a nice flight
SI114J-00530-P50019 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 9.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> students can use technology to study more effectively in the ways that they can search everything they want in the web
SI114J-00530-P50019 1 SI114J-00530 9.95 17.02 <o,Q4,C,P5> that why the internet and the cell phones and computers let us be more flexible
SI114J-00530-P50019 1 SI114J-00530 17.02 20.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> and also if we have homework we can do a bit of
SI114J-00530-P50020 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 13.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that learn face to face with a teacher it's better coz we are in the pandemic way and it's not easy to learn by classes online
SI114J-00530-P50020 1 SI114J-00530 13.43 14.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i don't like
SI114J-00530-P50020 1 SI114J-00530 14.63 17.11 <o,Q4,C,P5> i prefer face to face really
SI114J-00530-P50020 1 SI114J-00530 17.11 20.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> i understand more than online classes
SI114J-00530-P50021 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 8.48 <o,Q4,C,P5> if you work with a group in a project you can learn how to work in a group
SI114J-00530-P50021 1 SI114J-00530 8.48 14.84 <o,Q4,C,P5> you learn how to share your information with other people
SI114J-00530-P50021 1 SI114J-00530 14.84 20.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> and also it let you learn how to be in a
SI114J-00530-P50022 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 5.74 <o,Q4,C,P5> well in my opinion i prefer read alone coz i understand more
SI114J-00530-P50022 1 SI114J-00530 5.74 10.70 <o,Q4,C,P5> if i don't understand i read it and repeat it again again again until i understand
SI114J-00530-P50022 1 SI114J-00530 10.70 15.11 <o,Q4,C,P5> but in attending lectures if you understand that's it
SI114J-00530-P50022 1 SI114J-00530 15.11 16.80 <o,Q4,C,P5> if you don't sorry
SI114J-00530-P50022 1 SI114J-00530 16.80 20.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> so that's why i prefer learn
SI114J-00530-P50023 1 SI114J-00530 0.00 6.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's very important for the universities to provide learning facilities
SI114J-00530-P50023 1 SI114J-00530 6.60 14.14 <o,Q4,C,P5> coz if the university have a level of learning facilities the students will approach all the these facilities
SI114J-00530-P50023 1 SI114J-00530 14.14 20.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> so the students are going to be in the highest level of students
SI114J-00549-P10005 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 5.54 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm really interesting in the environment because i think is very important
SI114J-00549-P10005 1 SI114J-00549 5.54 10.48 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if the environment is well our life is well too
SI114J-00549-P10005 1 SI114J-00549 10.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> however (%hesitation%) if we don't (%hesitation%) take care them we have a lot of problem with our lives for example
SI114J-00549-P10006 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 12.69 <o,Q5,B1,P1> we enjoying together when we we go (ou-) out (%hesitation%) to have a a drink or we go to the disco or we go a concert
SI114J-00549-P10006 1 SI114J-00549 12.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) beside we enjoying when we speak (%hesitation%) too
SI114J-00549-P10007 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 2.56 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very similar to my father
SI114J-00549-P10007 1 SI114J-00549 2.56 10.22 <o,Q5,B1,P1> both are (%hesitation%) a lot of kind and besides we are very similar
SI114J-00549-P10007 1 SI114J-00549 10.22 16.02 <o,Q5,B1,P1> we look like (%hesitation%) equal
SI114J-00549-P10007 1 SI114J-00549 16.02 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) and we have the same (tra-)
SI114J-00549-P10008 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would live in the same town because i think that my town is fantastic and i don't like to move of them for this reason
SI114J-00549-P30017 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 22.49 <o,Q5,B1,P3> doing exercise is very important to be in fit and for this reason both schools and college (%hesitation%) should (%hesitation%) make a timetable where (%hesitation%) there there was a time to to do fitness fitness classes
SI114J-00549-P30017 1 SI114J-00549 22.49 34.60 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) this is very important because (%hesitation%) so the student can have a rest and (%hesitation%) and practice exercise
SI114J-00549-P30017 1 SI114J-00549 34.60 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> however some student can can would think that (%hesitation%) there isn't important and maybe they could prefer (%hesitation%) meet (%hesitation%) friends or spend their time studying or doing anything anything else
SI114J-00549-P40018 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 6.40 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in the first place (%hesitation%) bees collect nectar from from flowers
SI114J-00549-P40018 1 SI114J-00549 6.40 12.95 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then they make a honey from nectar in (%hesitation%) beehives
SI114J-00549-P40018 1 SI114J-00549 12.95 26.07 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) when the beehives are full beekeeper beekeepers collect honey and they introduce in in jars
SI114J-00549-P40018 1 SI114J-00549 26.07 37.48 <o,Q5,B1,P4> when they have (e-) enough jars they transport into the supermarket by by a car or by a lorry it depends
SI114J-00549-P40018 1 SI114J-00549 37.48 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally the the jar of a honey is selling in the supermarket
SI114J-00549-P50019 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 14.52 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the student choose (%hesitation%) another country because they want to learn another language and this this way is the best is the best for them
SI114J-00549-P50019 1 SI114J-00549 14.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> besides they can can travel and is (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00549-P50020 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 10.21 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the advantage (%hesitation%) of studying in a second language is that you can learn (%hesitation%) another idiom
SI114J-00549-P50020 1 SI114J-00549 10.21 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and so you can practice (%hesitation%) this language with (%hesitation%) the english or german or (itali-)
SI114J-00549-P50021 1 SI114J-00549 0.00 10.62 <o,Q5,B1,P5> when you are far of your country you're leave your family friends (%hesitation%) sometimes you can feel alone
SI114J-00549-P50021 1 SI114J-00549 10.62 12.59 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is very important for me
SI114J-00549-P50021 1 SI114J-00549 12.59 19.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> beside you you find other language and you have to communicate in other language
SI114J-00549-P50021 1 SI114J-00549 19.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is very (diffi-)

SI114J-00549-P50023 1 SI114J-00549 1.79 7.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it isn't necessary go abroad (%hesitation%) for becoming independent
SI114J-00549-P50023 1 SI114J-00549 7.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example (%hesitation%) you can live with your father or your family in general but you can can be independent and doing your housework and your food

SI114J-00616-P10005 1 SI114J-00616 5.35 13.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that is because here in spain (%hesitation%) summers are very hot and i don't enjoy them very much
SI114J-00616-P10005 1 SI114J-00616 13.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i prefer to to go trekking or something like that in that (%hesitation%) period of time because it is
SI114J-00616-P10006 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 14.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think it is very important to be aware of the of the news because if you want to to change something that you don't like you first (%hesitation%) have to know that it (%hesitation%) it is happening
SI114J-00616-P10006 1 SI114J-00616 14.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) if you don't know if it is happening you you can't change it

SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 13.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> although there are lot of people that think it is not necessary necessary to include a period of practical work experience in the in the degrees (%hesitation%) there is a big argument about this
SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 13.88 25.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the one hand including a period of practical work experience (%hesitation%) is positive because you are going to be more prepared to get into the labour market when you are out of the university
SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 25.00 36.33 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also you are going to learn about things that only that are only learned when you are working (%hesitation%) in a different place of the university from the university
SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 36.33 40.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example to having to have a boss and some things like that
SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 40.63 56.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand (%hesitation%) it is difficult to include (%hesitation%) a (pra-) a period of practical work in that degrees that has (%hesitation%) that degree that have (%hesitation%) a big theoretical park part because they are going to take time off from them
SI114J-00616-P30017 1 SI114J-00616 56.18 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in conclusion i think it is possible but (%hesitation%)
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 10.93 <o,Q4,B2,P4> okay i'm going to talk to you about the evolution of of the number of people who has visit has been visiting last days (%hesitation%) three new online pop music sites
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 10.93 15.09 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) firstly i'm going to talk about (%hesitation%) tunes net
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 15.09 34.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this website (%hesitation%) has been (%hesitation%) increasing the visitors has has been increasing (%hesitation%) all over the time (%hesitation%) going from (%hesitation%) one from twenty thousand of people to (%hesitation%) one hundred of people
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 34.52 42.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> on the other hand we find that music now has more or less the same visitors (%hesitation%) at the beginning and at the end
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 42.05 50.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the middle of the figure we can see that (%hesitation%) the number of visitors increased but (%hesitation%) at the end not
SI114J-00616-P40018 1 SI114J-00616 50.49 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and finally (%hesitation%) songs four you has an increasing in a moment from the their third day to the fourth day and
SI114J-00616-P50019 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think a good team leader has to know how to communicate with other components of the team and also it has to be he he or she has to be (%hesitation%) (op-) optimistic because he he can't (%hesitation%) go down easily
SI114J-00616-P50020 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 14.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the main problem of working in a small team is that if they have a not very interesting interest interest sorry in the problem the in the thing they are working on it is not going to be finished
SI114J-00616-P50020 1 SI114J-00616 14.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because there are not many people and the people who are
SI114J-00616-P50021 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is important to to say your the the
SI114J-00616-P50022 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it is necessary to be face to face in order to be effective because (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) this year for example in in my degree i have been working (%hesitation%) on in a work team (%hesitation%) online and it was really difficult to organise all the work and it is better to be face to face
SI114J-00616-P50023 1 SI114J-00616 0.00 5.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it depends on the components of the teamwork effective work
SI114J-00616-P50023 1 SI114J-00616 5.39 12.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if the components of the teamwork are very good and they are hard workeds workers it can be better than being alone
SI114J-00616-P50023 1 SI114J-00616 12.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it but if not maybe it is better to to work by yourself
SI114J-00619-P10005 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 6.37 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i will say quite a lot because i'm a person who are very keen on travelling around the world
SI114J-00619-P10005 1 SI114J-00619 6.37 12.50 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and one of the most aspects that i like is to know more about the other culture
SI114J-00619-P10005 1 SI114J-00619 12.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i found quite (%hesitation%) fascinating to learn how people (%hesitation%) enjoy their
SI114J-00619-P10006 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 3.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i try to take it easy honestly after i have been working
SI114J-00619-P10006 1 SI114J-00619 3.34 13.03 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i i'm mad about (%hesitation%) making plans at the beach or in the natural environment where i can find my own peace and quiet

SI114J-00619-P10006 1 SI114J-00619 18.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> could be
SI114J-00619-P10007 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 2.33 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there are many ways to improve my english

SI114J-00619-P10007 1 SI114J-00619 10.54 16.17 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) also to listen to music (%hesitation%) with the letter (%hesitation%) written down

SI114J-00619-P10008 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 11.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it could be to learn another language as for example (%hesitation%) french because it could bring me many opportunities to develop my professional career
SI114J-00619-P10008 1 SI114J-00619 11.58 14.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm also interested on international business

SI114J-00619-P30017 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 7.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> to get a job while you're studying could have many pros and cons as everything else in life
SI114J-00619-P30017 1 SI114J-00619 7.41 24.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) some primary advantage could be that you can obtain some (%hesitation%) savings what will be great for paying your (%hesitation%) du tuition fees (%hesitation%) which are really expensive or even to hang out at the weekend with your friends
SI114J-00619-P30017 1 SI114J-00619 24.22 47.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but on the other hand it could be it could have a big (%hesitation%) drawback that it could be connected with (%hesitation%) the stress that's could generate (%hesitation%) to combine work with study because you maybe have (%hesitation%) many stuff to do as homework or university exposition
SI114J-00619-P30017 1 SI114J-00619 47.48 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so as i see it i consider that if the job is connected with your career it could be fabulous amazing but if not i will prefer just to focus on
SI114J-00619-P40018 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 12.49 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well let's let's explain the process of the acid rain (%hesitation%) what is represented in the presentation or in the graphs (%hesitation%) that we have below
SI114J-00619-P40018 1 SI114J-00619 12.49 19.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so (%hesitation%) it has started in the factories and vehicle which are the main sources of pollution
SI114J-00619-P40018 1 SI114J-00619 19.46 29.54 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the acid particle (%hesitation%) produced in the factories (%hesitation%) are in the smoke that are carry out (%hesitation%) by by the wind
SI114J-00619-P40018 1 SI114J-00619 29.54 47.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) some acid particle normally fall as dust and other are mixed with cloud water so the final result is (%hesitation%) snow or rain that contain that acid particle provocating the damage (%hesitation%) to the environment
SI114J-00619-P40018 1 SI114J-00619 47.26 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that's one of the main problem that we are having nowadays with the climate change and the global warming
SI114J-00619-P50019 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would recommend them to follow a balanced diet with lots of fresh vegetable and fruit
SI114J-00619-P50019 1 SI114J-00619 6.79 17.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and forget about two miracle diet that promise you to lose weight so easy and fast because they are not bringing you anything good
SI114J-00619-P50019 1 SI114J-00619 17.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i will advise
SI114J-00619-P50020 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 9.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> scientists around the world claim that to drink as at least two liter of water per day is fundamental to keep you healthy
SI114J-00619-P50020 1 SI114J-00619 9.56 12.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i totally agree with them
SI114J-00619-P50020 1 SI114J-00619 12.41 15.81 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider to drink water really good for health
SI114J-00619-P50020 1 SI114J-00619 15.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so yeah i will i will follow their advice
SI114J-00619-P50021 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 5.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> most definitely (%hesitation%) at least to do some walk or to go run
SI114J-00619-P50021 1 SI114J-00619 5.97 13.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you don't need to do a vigorous exercise but i think it's fundamental to move a bit (%hesitation%) throughout the day
SI114J-00619-P50021 1 SI114J-00619 13.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because (%hesitation%) your legs and (%hesitation%) your entire (bo-) body
SI114J-00619-P50022 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 4.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i don't know if you need to rest (%hesitation%) eight hour or less
SI114J-00619-P50022 1 SI114J-00619 4.88 16.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but what i'm pretty sure about is that you need to rest your due time (%hesitation%) because you need to have (%hesitation%) energy to affront your next day
SI114J-00619-P50022 1 SI114J-00619 16.33 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so as i see it is fundamental to rest
SI114J-00619-P50023 1 SI114J-00619 0.00 3.80 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it totally depends in the way you use that technology
SI114J-00619-P50023 1 SI114J-00619 3.80 13.31 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it has brought us many benefits (%hesitation%) obviously as (%hesitation%) the connection with your family and friends immediately
SI114J-00619-P50023 1 SI114J-00619 13.31 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but on the other hand social media is bringing us many bad consequences related with the body
SI114J-00622-P10005 1 SI114J-00622 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm so interested in the environment because we are living in a changeable world and it is pretty important to be part of the change and think about the environment for the future generations and to take care of them and our environment

SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 0.00 23.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think one advantage i can find if (colle-) college should make times in the school day for all students to do fitness classes is that they will have a better lifestyle and healthy lifestyle with different kind of (%hesitation%) traditions too that improve their healthy lives
SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 23.87 31.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> the the one disadvanture disadvantage i can find is that not all the students like to do sports
SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 31.41 39.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> some others prefers to do art (%hesitation%) activities or another kind of activities
SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 39.50 46.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion they should be in your own opinion if you want to practice exercise
SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 46.89 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think schools should have different (e-) teams if the student want to go or practise or not in

SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 18.31 22.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> it represents that bees collect nectar from flowers

SI114J-00644-P10007 1 SI114J-00644 6.62 8.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> he's twenty years younger than me
SI114J-00644-P10007 1 SI114J-00644 8.85 12.49 <o,Q4,C,P1> and he's one of my favourite people in the world
SI114J-00644-P10007 1 SI114J-00644 12.49 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> he (%hesitation%) i really like to talk to him to play games with him and just let him take me on a
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 4.49 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would love to be a university professor
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644 4.49 14.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to teach (%hesitation%) in the area of education (%hesitation%) possibly regarding inclusion or didactics
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644 14.68 20.46 <o,Q4,C,P1> that would be my favorite job (%hesitation%) my ideal job
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 18.99 <o,Q5,C,P3> some advantages of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 18.99 22.10 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there are some huge disadvantages
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 22.10 32.19 <o,Q5,C,P3> for instance they students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies (s-) if they have to be working instead
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 32.19 46.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> drop out rates might increase a lot because (%hesitation%) what would be the point of of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 46.00 51.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 51.87 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) students should get scholarships or some other alternatives to funding
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 5.58 <o,Q4,C,P4> by airplane can be a bit daunting especially if it's your first time
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 5.58 11.72 <o,Q4,C,P4> so now i will give you some very simple steps (%hesitation%) for you to travel by airplane
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 11.72 15.70 <o,Q4,C,P4> the very first thing you need to do is travel to the airport
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 15.70 23.28 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on your available options
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 23.28 28.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you've arrived to the airport the first thing you need to do is go to check in
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 28.14 32.02 <o,Q4,C,P4> in check in they will give you some information about your flight
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 32.02 35.74 <o,Q4,C,P4> they will put your luggage into the cargo
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 35.74 38.67 <o,Q4,C,P4> and they will give you your boarding pass
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 38.67 45.21 <o,Q4,C,P4> you will need your boarding pass as well as your i d to go through document control and security
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 45.21 51.44 <o,Q4,C,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 51.44 58.46 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you pass security you just need to wait until the the stewardesses give you the chance to board
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 58.46 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and now
SI114J-00644-P50019 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 5.12 <o,Q4,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00644-P50019 1 SI114J-00644 5.12 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> for instance you can take notes faster you can record and later listen calmly or you can even use the internet to find more information about any topic you want to learn more about
SI114J-00644-P50020 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 16.21 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or self regulating their own learning
SI114J-00644-P50020 1 SI114J-00644 16.21 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but if people feel more comfortable (stud-) studying alone
SI114J-00644-P50021 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00644-P50022 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 2.82 <o,Q4,C,P5> for me personally it is
SI114J-00644-P50022 1 SI114J-00644 2.82 8.66 <o,Q4,C,P5> i can focus much longer if i'm listening to a person than reading by myself
SI114J-00644-P50022 1 SI114J-00644 8.66 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i also appreciate having the opportunity to ask questions or make comments and then we can all pitch in and have a a greater leng length of knowledge
SI114J-00644-P50023 1 SI114J-00644 0.00 6.27 <o,Q4,C,P5> (cilities-) are for students to use is of utmost importance
SI114J-00644-P50023 1 SI114J-00644 6.27 11.15 <o,Q4,C,P5> students spend very long hours in university
SI114J-00644-P50023 1 SI114J-00644 11.15 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> sometimes they have classes very early in the morning and very late in the afternoon or they live far away and they need to (s-) the learning facility
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 3.62 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 3.62 6.42 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i really love england
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 6.42 11.83 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been there several times and i always try to learn anything new when i go there
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 11.83 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i have readen different (%hesitation%) books i have taken different classes on its culture
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 17.31 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think it's really interesting
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 2.18 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i do different things
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 2.18 5.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example lately i have taken up into cooking
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 5.96 11.01 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learn about different recipes
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 11.01 17.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> but for example i also love listening to music doing sport and of course hanging out with friends
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 17.03 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so that's more or less my free time
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 8.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> well for me the best way for improving your english is taking part into a community of english learning people
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657 8.46 12.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> and furthermore also in a community of english speaking (l-) people
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657 12.60 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so like that you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
SI114J-00657-P10008 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 17.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and i have been so amazed by those programmers (wh-) which can only by reading sentences they can code a new app or a new video game
SI114J-00657-P10008 1 SI114J-00657 17.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and is something which i (%hesitation%) hope
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 6.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think that taking a job while you're studying is a really good experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 6.02 14.18 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 14.18 24.73 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as time management and how to organise yourself and who's to be responsible for your own acts
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 24.73 27.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there also will have other disadvantages
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 27.56 31.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you wouldn't have less time to focus on your studies
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 31.74 36.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> and so i think it's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 36.82 50.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you shouldn't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not make possible for you to focus on your job (o-) or your learning of the university
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 50.53 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so even if it's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 5.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> acid rain generates from vehicles and for factories
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 5.11 10.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> so when they create pollution that pollution get up to the atmosphere
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 10.13 18.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with other particles of water which would create a cloud
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 18.95 23.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> that cloud would end up raining over the environment
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 23.67 25.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it will have a lot of effects
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 25.73 33.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> so for example it will cause deforestation it will cause that animals will die and it will cause a lot of environmental (pro-) problems
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 33.91 40.96 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example it could make that the terrain is not good for being able to grow things there
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 40.96 49.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> so you will all not have only a damage to the environment but also to ourself because we have to remember that we are living of than environment
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 49.62 55.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> so the effects that we have on them it will end up affecting also us
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 55.77 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so yeah
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 5.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> well the bettest advice by that i can give them is to keep track of what you're eating
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 5.06 10.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they take
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 10.86 17.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> so like that at the end of the week they can compare days and they will be able to see ok in which moments i ate bad
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 17.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> what are the problems that are in my (alim-)
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 2.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> well for me it's really important to drink water
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 2.75 8.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 8.93 14.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> if we don't take enough water we could have some effects as severe as depression or anxiety
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 14.79 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 5.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that even if it's just for a bit we should every day do exercise
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657 5.07 9.17 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657 9.17 15.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> we can also do another type of of exercise for example like climbing or moving walking to the job
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657 15.95 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's important because it could helps a prevent of cardiovascular
SI114J-00657-P50022 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 2.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think it really depends on people
SI114J-00657-P50022 1 SI114J-00657 2.23 13.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> so for example some other some people may need eight hours of more for being unable to have enough energy for the whole day while some others would have enough with five or six hours
SI114J-00657-P50022 1 SI114J-00657 13.41 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i think it's important that we know what do we really need and we try to focus on that
SI114J-00657-P50023 1 SI114J-00657 0.00 9.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think it depends because for example technology has help us overcome different (wi-) illnesses as a for example why the cancer and thing like that
SI114J-00657-P50023 1 SI114J-00657 9.34 14.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> so moreover the whereabouts are helping us to be better at tracking our own
SI114J-00657-P50023 1 SI114J-00657 14.80 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> this is is so this really good because we can keep track of our advances
SI114J-00667-P10005 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 12.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time of year is summer because i haven't got any obligation and i would like (%hesitation%) all activities that i want with my friends and my family
SI114J-00667-P10005 1 SI114J-00667 12.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think it would be a good time for spend (ti-) my free time with them
SI114J-00667-P10006 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 15.47 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think is essential (%hesitation%) listen and read news because (%hesitation%) you need to know all the the success in the world and the economy and the politics
SI114J-00667-P10006 1 SI114J-00667 15.47 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think it could be a good idea to (%hesitation%) know the news
SI114J-00667-P10007 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to go (t-) (%hesitation%) to the to my cousin's house but (%hesitation%) then i i love (%hesitation%) play basketball and go with my brother to play video games and play with other friends
SI114J-00667-P10008 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i hope to get a well paid (%hesitation%) job and then i think i believe i will live in madrid or in barcelona to to know different aspect in a (multic-) multinational company
SI114J-00667-P30017 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 19.39 <o,Q5,B2,P3> okay one of the advantages of including a practical work experience in the university degrees are (%hesitation%) you could (%hesitation%) put all your knowledge in doing different type of activities (%hesitation%) that will you do in your future work
SI114J-00667-P30017 1 SI114J-00667 19.39 32.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> however (%hesitation%) i believe (%hesitation%) one of the disadvantages is (%hesitation%) people (%hesitation%) are not focus in the (s-) different subjects that they have they have
SI114J-00667-P30017 1 SI114J-00667 32.17 35.69 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think is (ve-) a very big problem
SI114J-00667-P30017 1 SI114J-00667 35.69 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i believe that (%hesitation%) have a period of practical work experience is very important for student to improve their self (%hesitation%) their knowledge and put all they have in doing a well job and have a very short experience for his future career
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 0.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> ok
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 0.95 4.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the graph we can see three lines
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 4.77 8.16 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) one red one yellow and one blue
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 8.16 14.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) in the first (%hesitation%) the line red (%hesitation%) correspond with tune net
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 14.86 29.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) we can see in the five (%hesitation%) first days (%hesitation%) the the line is increasing the thousand of people who who listen tunes net
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 29.61 42.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and in in then in the (se-) in the seventh day (%hesitation%) a lot of a lot of one hundred thousand people (%hesitation%) listen (tun-) tunes net
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 42.72 52.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) however (%hesitation%) we can see music now is more (cost-) more constant (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) get play high level during all the week day
SI114J-00667-P40018 1 SI114J-00667 52.52 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the songs for you is the less and go down the line yellow
SI114J-00667-P50019 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 6.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think a very good team leader is a person who have got different skills

SI114J-00667-P50020 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 14.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> working in (%hesitation%) small groups is very difficult because (%hesitation%) you could agree or not agree with the people in your team and you haven't got different a lot of ideas for doing the work
SI114J-00667-P50020 1 SI114J-00667 14.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i believe that it's better for work in (%hesitation%) big teams
SI114J-00667-P50021 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 8.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) the contrast the opinions is very important for doing a (goo-) a well job
SI114J-00667-P50021 1 SI114J-00667 8.59 17.19 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) i believe that having a look with different opinion is essential for doing very good your job
SI114J-00667-P50021 1 SI114J-00667 17.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it's very
SI114J-00667-P50022 1 SI114J-00667 0.00 1.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think so
SI114J-00667-P50022 1 SI114J-00667 1.79 10.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i believe that (%hesitation%) working in a team (%hesitation%) you don't mind if you are working face to face or online
SI114J-00667-P50022 1 SI114J-00667 10.96 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but it is essential to have a different conversation to to do a well job

SI114J-00667-P50023 1 SI114J-00667 8.91 14.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i believe that working working in a team is better than working alone
SI114J-00667-P50023 1 SI114J-00667 14.35 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because (%hesitation%) you could make different areas working alone and you don't know what
SI114J-00689-P10005 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 4.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well now i'm living united states
SI114J-00689-P10005 1 SI114J-00689 4.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's beautiful and it's a good experience because i can improve my english here
SI114J-00689-P10006 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like spending time with my friends and travelling

SI114J-00689-P30017 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 9.14 <o,Q5,B2,P3> think it's good for student to have a job because they can (%hesitation%) be more responsible
SI114J-00689-P30017 1 SI114J-00689 9.14 21.57 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages is you can be more responsible and make money and the best thing if you work in your area
SI114J-00689-P30017 1 SI114J-00689 21.57 32.99 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages is that you can't you need to find out the time to stud and dedicate for the university studies
SI114J-00689-P30017 1 SI114J-00689 32.99 44.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion it's good for you to have a half time job and (%hesitation%) so you can stud and work
SI114J-00689-P30017 1 SI114J-00689 44.78 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that's the best solution
SI114J-00689-P40018 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 8.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first you if you're going travelling by airplane you need to travel to airport
SI114J-00689-P40018 1 SI114J-00689 8.84 14.47 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can mo by you can go by car by bus or by subway or train
SI114J-00689-P40018 1 SI114J-00689 14.47 26.54 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) when you get to the airport you need to to do the check in and then (%hesitation%) you need to pass through document control and the security
SI114J-00689-P40018 1 SI114J-00689 26.54 36.83 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you need to wait so while you are waiting you can go to eat something or you can use the restroom or buy some souvenirs or have a coffee
SI114J-00689-P40018 1 SI114J-00689 36.83 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then you can go board in the airplane and then your flight is ready to go
SI114J-00689-P50019 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 5.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology can help you with a (l-) a lot about studying and learning
SI114J-00689-P50019 1 SI114J-00689 5.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you can have online class you can access a lot of books articles so it's a good tools to to learn instead
SI114J-00689-P50020 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 5.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because for me it's easier to study face to face
SI114J-00689-P50020 1 SI114J-00689 5.10 9.13 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if i study by myself i can't focus
SI114J-00689-P50020 1 SI114J-00689 9.13 11.81 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but the technology helps a lot
SI114J-00689-P50020 1 SI114J-00689 11.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think face to face is the best
SI114J-00689-P50021 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 8.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you need to think about someone else what is the team work so i think this a great skill
SI114J-00689-P50021 1 SI114J-00689 8.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) and you need to learn about (%hesitation%) being responsible
SI114J-00689-P50022 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 2.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think both are great
SI114J-00689-P50022 1 SI114J-00689 2.10 9.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) attending lectures (%hesitation%) can help you a lot with a lot of subject
SI114J-00689-P50022 1 SI114J-00689 9.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i also like to read alone
SI114J-00689-P50023 1 SI114J-00689 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the universities need to find out ways (w-) to make easier for the students to learn or for the students to (l-) want to learn for them to want to do that
SI114J-00699-P10005 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 8.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the environment isn't a topic that i am very interested in
SI114J-00699-P10005 1 SI114J-00699 8.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> although i should work on that because we should all (%hesitation%) work on taking care of the
SI114J-00699-P10006 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 6.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> there are plenty of things that me and my friends enjoy doing together
SI114J-00699-P10006 1 SI114J-00699 6.59 12.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example we like to go for a walk and have some drinks
SI114J-00699-P10006 1 SI114J-00699 12.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we also (%hesitation%) love to watch movies and have a great time together
SI114J-00699-P10007 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 9.54 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i believe that the person that i am more similar to in my family is my mother
SI114J-00699-P10007 1 SI114J-00699 9.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in fact we are a little bad tempered (%hesitation%) but we also can be very kind and lovely with people that we care about
SI114J-00699-P10008 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 6.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> at the moment i don't really know where i want to live in the future
SI114J-00699-P10008 1 SI114J-00699 6.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i do know that i wanna be able to travel and discover different countries to make (%hesitation%) my mind about where i want to live when i'll be an adult
SI114J-00699-P30017 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 8.32 <o,Q5,C,P3> schhols and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI114J-00699-P30017 1 SI114J-00699 8.32 12.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> in fact there are many advantages about this
SI114J-00699-P30017 1 SI114J-00699 12.39 21.17 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example students will be healthier and will have a hobby besides (%hesitation%) school
SI114J-00699-P30017 1 SI114J-00699 21.17 42.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there are some disadvantages for example they can be (%hesitation%) more tired and maybe if the facilities aren't (%hesitation%) modern they won't have showers (%hesitation%) to take a shower after they exercise
SI114J-00699-P30017 1 SI114J-00699 42.30 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) personally i am (%hesitation%) totally in favour of (%hesitation%) fitness classes because it gives you a lot of energy to continue your
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 7.65 <o,Q4,C,P4> i am going to present you about how honey is produced
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 7.65 13.82 <o,Q4,C,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from (%hesitation%) different flowers
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 13.82 19.61 <o,Q4,C,P4> after that bees make honey from nectar in bee hives
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 19.61 31.89 <o,Q4,C,P4> beekeepers collect the honey that's produced (%hesitation%) from (%hesitation%) the bees and (%hesitation%) fills some pots with that honey
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 31.89 47.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> after that (%hesitation%) truck drivers collect those pots to take them to the stores where the pots are stored and are available for customers to buy it
SI114J-00699-P40018 1 SI114J-00699 47.98 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> this process is a very interesting process and shows us how nature works
SI114J-00699-P50019 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 8.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there are many elements that students should (%hesitation%) count on before choosing a country
SI114J-00699-P50019 1 SI114J-00699 8.64 15.24 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example they should see what is the rate of the university they're choosing
SI114J-00699-P50019 1 SI114J-00699 15.24 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they also have to list their priorities
SI114J-00699-P50020 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 5.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> studying in a second language gives you many advantages
SI114J-00699-P50020 1 SI114J-00699 5.04 8.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in fact it allows you to meet new people
SI114J-00699-P50020 1 SI114J-00699 8.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it also lets you discover a new culture and lets you (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) (a-)
SI114J-00699-P50021 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 6.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there are many difficulties of studying in another country
SI114J-00699-P50021 1 SI114J-00699 6.14 9.81 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in fact you have to adapt to another culture
SI114J-00699-P50021 1 SI114J-00699 9.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> sometimes if (%hesitation%) the language that s speaked in that country is different to your
SI114J-00699-P50022 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 17.53 <o,Q4,B2,P5> when students are studying in another country they can learn about local culture by meeting people by going to museums or art conventions
SI114J-00699-P50022 1 SI114J-00699 17.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and
SI114J-00699-P50023 1 SI114J-00699 0.00 5.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for sure studying in a new country helps you become independent
SI114J-00699-P50023 1 SI114J-00699 5.64 8.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in fact you need to be organised
SI114J-00699-P50023 1 SI114J-00699 8.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you're on your own so you need to (%hesitation%) make schedules and gestion
SI114J-00704-P10005 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 12.07 <o,Q4,C,P1> i am high interest in learning about other countries because i love to share (%hesitation%) the difference between cultures

SI114J-00704-P10007 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 10.77 <o,Q4,C,P1> i think the best way is travelling (%hesitation%) and talking with people from other countries or cities
SI114J-00704-P10007 1 SI114J-00704 10.77 11.73 <o,Q4,C,P1> yeah
SI114J-00704-P10007 1 SI114J-00704 11.73 17.13 <o,Q4,C,P1> also watching cinema in original version and tv shows
SI114J-00704-P10007 1 SI114J-00704 17.13 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> reading is a good method too
SI114J-00704-P10008 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 8.15 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would love to learn how how (%hesitation%) do gardening
SI114J-00704-P10008 1 SI114J-00704 8.15 11.72 <o,Q4,C,P1> i love gardening but i am terrible with plants

SI114J-00704-P10008 1 SI114J-00704 16.02 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i would love to learn gardening
SI114J-00704-P30017 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 20.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main advantage that a part time job while you are studying is that it's the best way to know how your future will be about the reality of your future world of the profession that you have choose
SI114J-00704-P30017 1 SI114J-00704 20.45 31.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the weaker point here is that you can realise that you have chosen something that you don't like it
SI114J-00704-P30017 1 SI114J-00704 31.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i think it is a really great opportunity to be sure about your choice and about your future because your work life will be long so you need to to be sure about it
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 14.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello i'm going to talk about acid rain and how or (%hesitation%) what are the things acid rain causes
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 14.10 18.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> factories and vehicles create pollution
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 18.22 24.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollution forms acid particles that are in smoke
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 24.74 30.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> smoke carry this acid particles by the wind
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 30.99 47.36 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of these acid particles maybe fall as dust in water and contaminate this our water like lakes and the sea
SI114J-00704-P40018 1 SI114J-00704 47.36 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> other acid particles mix with the clouds and then rain and made particles are
SI114J-00704-P50019 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 11.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion eating habits is (%hesitation%) so important to our healthy to our body to our mind
SI114J-00704-P50019 1 SI114J-00704 11.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i recommend healthy eating habits to feel better
SI114J-00704-P50020 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 8.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the human body are form by a high percentage of water
SI114J-00704-P50020 1 SI114J-00704 8.14 13.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so drink water is important to us because we need to be hydratated
SI114J-00704-P50020 1 SI114J-00704 13.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and we need water for our body
SI114J-00704-P50021 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 8.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion is important doing exercise at least three days per week
SI114J-00704-P50021 1 SI114J-00704 8.48 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if you can do it exercise every way just a little it is more healthier than not do it
SI114J-00704-P50022 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 6.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think sleeping well is a really important to us (be-) because we need to rest
SI114J-00704-P50022 1 SI114J-00704 6.19 13.51 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if you can sleep at least eight hours will be great for your body

SI114J-00704-P50023 1 SI114J-00704 0.00 8.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think technology is is not like a
SI114J-00704-P50023 1 SI114J-00704 8.02 16.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we we need technology and i think we we need to determine if we use it in a healthy way or not
SI114J-00704-P50023 1 SI114J-00704 16.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think technology is a really good for (u-)
SI114J-00742-P10005 1 SI114J-00742 0.00 2.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it's a good question

SI114J-00754-P30017 1 SI114J-00754 18.64 23.30 <o,Q3,B2,P3> it will help him or her to concentrate more on her studies
SI114J-00754-P30017 1 SI114J-00754 23.30 32.40 <o,Q3,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) ultimately it will (%hesitation%) help him or her achieving (%hesitation%) a better (%hesitation%) outcome
SI114J-00754-P30017 1 SI114J-00754 32.40 38.80 <o,Q3,B2,P3> and i don't see any disadvantages of doing regular exercise unless you are overdoing it
SI114J-00754-P30017 1 SI114J-00754 38.80 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion i suggest that it should be made mandatory for every student to do regular exercise at a particular time
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 5.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today we will see how honey is produced
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 5.56 14.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> from the diagram we can see that at the very beginning the nectar produced by flowers is collected by bees
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 14.27 26.28 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the next stage the nectar is deposited into beehives and (%hesitation%) the bees turn nectar into honey
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 26.28 37.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the third stage (%hesitation%) the beekeepers unbox the beehives and collect honey from those (%hesitation%) beehives
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 37.20 44.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) later the collected honey is poured into jars or containers
SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 44.23 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the jarred honey is transported to shops or stores for final delivery to consumers
SI114J-00754-P50019 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 6.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there are many factors a a student should consider when he or she decides to study abroad
SI114J-00754-P50019 1 SI114J-00754 6.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) first of all he or she needs to understand that the educational standard in that country is very high
SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 11.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the obvious advantage is that (%hesitation%) student learns (%hesitation%) different language and he understands how to communicate in that language better
SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754 11.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
SI114J-00754-P50021 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country
SI114J-00754-P50021 1 SI114J-00754 5.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and secondly they might not get help as soon as possible because they will have no relatives in the country
SI114J-00754-P50022 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a theater or by (%hesitation%) going to a concert with friends
SI114J-00754-P50022 1 SI114J-00754 13.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) they also can learn about the local culture by visiting (pe-) museums
SI114J-00754-P50023 1 SI114J-00754 0.00 14.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also agree that studying abroad helps a student to become (in-) independent because (%hesitation%) when a student studies abroad he or she needs to do many things of his or her own
SI114J-00754-P50023 1 SI114J-00754 14.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so he learns how to live by himself or (hers-)
SI114J-00758-P10005 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm interest in other countries (%hesitation%) like the new cultures the people improve my skills improve my lifestyle skills like cooking (%hesitation%) washing my
SI114J-00758-P10006 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my favourite activities to spending my time are going to go to the gym going to the gym to train me meet with my friends or watch tv to to watch watch football in the tv
SI114J-00758-P10007 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 16.77 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think that the best the best form to improve my english is going to a place where the english (%hesitation%) is the main language like england australia u s a
SI114J-00758-P10007 1 SI114J-00758 16.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> because in that cities you can
SI114J-00758-P10008 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would i would like to be invisible because people can't can't seen can't see me when i (%hesitation%) when i want to when i want to make (%hesitation%) a joke for example
SI114J-00758-P30017 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 34.05 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) in my in my opinion the advantages of of do part time jobs for university stalins (%hesitation%) are the that that is that students these students (%hesitation%) have more money than the students (%hesitation%) than the students than the students doesn't don't work
SI114J-00758-P30017 1 SI114J-00758 34.05 40.31 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and the (st-) the students have more laboral experience
SI114J-00758-P30017 1 SI114J-00758 40.31 56.11 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the disadvantages are that that the students have less time to to to study to do (%hesitation%) university works
SI114J-00758-P30017 1 SI114J-00758 56.11 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and my opinion are (%hesitation%) that it get to do
SI114J-00758-P40018 1 SI114J-00758 0.00 7.78 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) in the diagram you can you can see the process to generate the acid rain

SI114J-00759-P30017 1 SI114J-00759 37.55 46.40 <o,Q4,C,P3> the only (ad-) disadvantage that i see is if you make the classes obligatory

SI114J-00759-P40018 1 SI114J-00759 0.00 6.79 <o,Q3,C,P4> the production of honey always starts with a natural process

SI114J-00759-P40018 1 SI114J-00759 40.72 60.00 <o,Q3,C,P4> then it goes to the industry that is processed by machines and then the transports transport the honey to the markets and there it goes
SI114J-00759-P50019 1 SI114J-00759 0.00 9.99 <o,Q4,C,P5> first and foremost the students should first look at the university's reputation

SI1267-00100-P30017 1 SI1267-00100 41.58 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) my opinion is that it depends on (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) the (pers-) their personal opinion

SI1267-00100-P40018 1 SI1267-00100 49.59 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you should wait about some time until you're aboard to the airplane and that's all
SI1267-00100-P50019 1 SI1267-00100 0.00 10.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> nowadays many students use (%hesitation%) the technology (%hesitation%) as (%hesitation%) an effective way of studying and learning

SI1267-00100-P50020 1 SI1267-00100 0.00 16.93 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to be honest i believe that (%hesitation%) face to face (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) the most important the most useful and successful way of studying and learning
SI1267-00100-P50020 1 SI1267-00100 16.93 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as my personal experience
SI1267-00100-P50021 1 SI1267-00100 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> when students are working together on group projects (%hesitation%) they improve and develop the skill of (%hesitation%) be patient to express different opinions and accept (%hesitation%) others (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00100-P50022 1 SI1267-00100 0.00 8.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me the attending lectures (%hesitation%) are more effective (%hesitation%) of studying and learning
SI1267-00100-P50022 1 SI1267-00100 8.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and this is because you can learn from a teacher (%hesitation%) who gives you directions to the road to success
SI1267-00100-P50023 1 SI1267-00100 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me (%hesitation%) modern learning facilities (%hesitation%) at the university (%hesitation%) are so important because they give the opportunity to students to learn (%hesitation%) more effectively

SI1267-00265-P50023 1 SI1267-00265 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think technology is negative effect to people and we shouldn't use technology very much
SI1267-00271-P10005 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 5.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm very interesting (%hesitation%) about (%hesitation%) learning other country
SI1267-00271-P10005 1 SI1267-00271 5.23 13.82 <o,Q4,B2,P1> especially (%hesitation%) i am very interested in (%hesitation%) historical things and events and persons
SI1267-00271-P10005 1 SI1267-00271 13.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example (%hesitation%) american history is very amusing because
SI1267-00271-P10006 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 1.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like reading
SI1267-00271-P10006 1 SI1267-00271 1.78 8.55 <o,Q4,B2,P1> especially (historic-) historical (%hesitation%) (s-) reading books is (%hesitation%) my favourite book
SI1267-00271-P10006 1 SI1267-00271 8.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and so i spend my free time (%hesitation%) going to library and looking for my books and and reading
SI1267-00271-P10007 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 17.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i believe (%hesitation%) i need to (ha-) have a chance to speak english because (%hesitation%) in my in my division (%hesitation%) all person are japanese and so i don't touch in touch with english in my work
SI1267-00271-P10007 1 SI1267-00271 17.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) (s-)
SI1267-00271-P10008 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 16.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to (%hesitation%) improve my (kno-) knowledge of (%hesitation%) control engineering because my major is control engineering and (%hesitation%) i wish to get a p h d degree on this areas
SI1267-00271-P10008 1 SI1267-00271 16.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and so (%hesitation%) i want to (st-)
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 7.79 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i totally agree with the opinion that all university students should do a part time jobs
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 7.79 26.25 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i believe that it's a positive thing for student (%hesitation%) do the part time jobs because (%hesitation%) they can get (%hesitation%) work experience and (%hesitation%) money to buy (%hesitation%) something for (%hesitation%) studies
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 26.25 31.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand there are some negative aspect
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 31.13 38.89 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) it's a fact that (%hesitation%) they lose time for study (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 38.89 42.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the duty of student is to study
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 42.20 48.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and so (%hesitation%) it's a very large (%hesitation%) demerit
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 48.32 57.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in conclusion (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) all the university student should do part time jobs
SI1267-00271-P30017 1 SI1267-00271 57.30 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> thank for my (pre-)
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 8.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) i would like to talk about (%hesitation%) how pollution causes acid rain
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 8.14 11.63 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first take a look at this diagram
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 11.63 21.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 21.16 28.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that acid particle in smoke moving up to the sky
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 28.05 40.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) acid particles are carried by wind and some are some around some fall as dust
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 40.66 46.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the others (%hesitation%) mix with cloud water
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 46.02 58.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> eventually (%hesitation%) acid particle are in rain or snow and falling down falling down to ground and damage to environment
SI1267-00271-P40018 1 SI1267-00271 58.14 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is
SI1267-00271-P50019 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) i will advise the people who develop who want to develop (%hesitation%) good eating habit that (%hesitation%) it's a fact (e-) good eating habits (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) based
SI1267-00271-P50020 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 10.22 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i believe (%hesitation%) drinking a lot of water is very important especially (%hesitation%) (s-) in summer
SI1267-00271-P50020 1 SI1267-00271 10.22 18.22 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it is high temperature at summer and our body (%hesitation%) mainly consist of water
SI1267-00271-P50020 1 SI1267-00271 18.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and so we (nee-)
SI1267-00271-P50021 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 3.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i totally agree with the statement
SI1267-00271-P50021 1 SI1267-00271 3.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) everyday exercise is this essential because (%hesitation%) actually i (%hesitation%) always (%hesitation%) make a steps (%hesitation%) or (%hesitation%) by eight thousand
SI1267-00271-P50022 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i totally agree with the opinion that (%hesitation%) everyone needs at least eight hours sleep every day (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) in my case (%hesitation%) actually i spend (%hesitation%) six hours sleeping every day
SI1267-00271-P50023 1 SI1267-00271 0.00 16.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) generally technology has (%hesitation%) positive (%hesitation%) impact for (%hesitation%) people because (%hesitation%) we can easily get information by using (%hesitation%) internet
SI1267-00271-P50023 1 SI1267-00271 16.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) also we know
SI1267-00336-P10005 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00336-P10006 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 9.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending my free time dancing mexican cultural dances
SI1267-00336-P10006 1 SI1267-00336 9.88 12.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> this is what i love
SI1267-00336-P10006 1 SI1267-00336 12.58 15.84 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i do it every every weekend
SI1267-00336-P10006 1 SI1267-00336 15.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i love it
SI1267-00336-P10007 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 8.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is watching some series or listening music
SI1267-00336-P10007 1 SI1267-00336 8.68 11.47 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i do it every day
SI1267-00336-P10007 1 SI1267-00336 11.47 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and sometimes i call to my friends and we start to to talking in english
SI1267-00336-P10008 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 9.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would want to learn to to work in teams because i'm really impatient
SI1267-00336-P10008 1 SI1267-00336 9.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i need to work on that and (m-) make that other people do their work
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think that students doing part time jobs have some advantages
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 7.41 20.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this because they can practice and get some experience in in doing the the activities that that they know in a real work
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 20.41 42.15 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some disadvantages (%hesitation%) disadvantages of doing that is that (%hesitation%) they have less time for himselves for themselves and it's a really hard life to to have because the time isn't enough
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 42.15 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my own opinion i think that this is a good a good way to start in the in the business area
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 9.77 <o,Q5,B1,P4> okay first the industries make pollution and the acid particulars travel with the smoke
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 9.77 17.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the acid particulars are carried by the wind and some of this fall as dust
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 17.49 38.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> other used other of the particulars mix with the cloud and when it rain or snow these fill like acid particle particles in the environment
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 38.06 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this this could be very critical to all people
SI1267-00336-P50019 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 14.48 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well what i can say to people to have good habits in eating it's that they can start eating some vegetables and some fruits
SI1267-00336-P50019 1 SI1267-00336 14.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> this could be healthy for them
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 11.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336 11.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and apart of that this make you functional
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 8.50 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah doing exercise is every day is really important because this way you can stay stable
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336 8.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this mixed with some good eating habits you will be fit and reduce some grace
SI1267-00336-P50022 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah sleeping at least eight hours it's good because this way you your body can can rest during during this hours
SI1267-00336-P50023 1 SI1267-00336 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well actually technology has a positive a positive point in the (pe-) in the life of the people because people staying in house could start doing some exercise
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 11.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and (%hesitation%) the way they live (%hesitation%) is very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 11.50 16.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can find out more interesting and useful things (%hesitation%) to learn for example
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 16.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 9.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and meet interesting animals or plants
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376 9.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and (%hesitation%) another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
SI1267-00376-P10007 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> best way to improve my english is to go abroad (%hesitation%) where i can meet a lot of native speakers (%hesitation%) and they can help me (imp-) improve my english and (%hesitation%) at the same way i can (%hesitation%) get a lot of information from the culture where the the language is spoken and the way people live in their country
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 9.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my (%hesitation%) skills (%hesitation%) i will choose (%hesitation%) communication skills because it's very important nowadays to communicate effectively
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376 9.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) for example if you have a problem you need to explain it (%hesitation%) properly (%hesitation%) to people (%hesitation%) to make them understand your problem
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 8.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you don't have enough time of course
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 8.45 19.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the advantage of this is that (%hesitation%) you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works (%hesitation%) with working in teams for example
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 19.36 33.69 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) you can also achieve goals (%hesitation%) in many areas such as (%hesitation%) sharing ideas with others and (%hesitation%) get a feedback from experienced (%hesitation%) workers
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 33.69 44.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the disadvantage of this is that (%hesitation%) you have got a lot of tasks for university studies and (%hesitation%) for this you need a lot of time
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 44.04 48.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in this situation part time jobs (%hesitation%) wouldn't be suitable
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 48.31 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion (%hesitation%) many students should try it because it is very useful
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 17.43 <o,Q5,C,P4> well first of all (%hesitation%) factories produce (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) products and while they are producing them (%hesitation%) they also produce (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) dangerous elements which (%hesitation%) go up to the air and (%hesitation%) it causes a lot of pollution
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 17.43 21.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then the next step is that (%hesitation%) acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 21.68 29.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then wind (%hesitation%) carry them in the air to other places
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 29.84 35.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> and their (f-) fourth stage is that some acid particles (%hesitation%) fall as dust
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 35.85 39.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) five other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 39.14 42.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> the next step is acid articles are in the rain or snow
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 42.77 48.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the other problems with pollution (%hesitation%) are caused by vehicles
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 48.22 53.24 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) many transport are used by many factories and other companies
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 53.24 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and (%hesitation%) then we should (%hesitation%) reduce the transport
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 8.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain (%hesitation%) a lot of vitamins which can improve their health
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376 8.16 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and in the morning people (%hesitation%) can have (%hesitation%) cereals (%hesitation%) as breakfast (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) they should drink a lot of juice as well
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 8.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and (%hesitation%) to be more active
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376 8.27 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) are (%hesitation%) by this i need a lot of water and we should drink it (%hesitation%) as (%hesitation%) it's life
SI1267-00376-P50021 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 10.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my view it is very essential to do exercise every day because our muscles need to be improved and bones (%hesitation%) need some moving (%hesitation%) to be more flexible
SI1267-00376-P50021 1 SI1267-00376 10.68 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (a-) and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) everyone needs exercises (%hesitation%) to be more active and physically develop
SI1267-00376-P50022 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 9.02 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that everyone needs at least eight hours (%hesitation%) a day sleep because (%hesitation%) our brain needs the rest after busy days
SI1267-00376-P50022 1 SI1267-00376 9.02 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and if we can sleep more than eight hours (%hesitation%) it would be useful for our brains and (%hesitation%) our brains relaxed
SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376 0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,C,P5> generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because (%hesitation%) nowadays we can get easily get information from the internet for example or from other (%hesitation%) resources as well
SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376 14.76 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and we can save our lives
SI1267-00401-P10005 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 1.26 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING

SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 6.25 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well actually i enjoy watching tv
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401 6.25 14.85 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) sometimes i go out with my friends to play soccer
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401 14.85 17.95 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i play the guitar

SI1267-00401-P10007 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i think with my sister because she is just kinda my age and we've got the same tasty
SI1267-00401-P10008 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i would like to work as an engineer in the electronic because i really really love the electronic and i would like to develop (%hesitation%) robots and help to the people
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 17.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think the advantage would be that the students could earn their own money and so they could be buy anything that they need
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 17.86 40.28 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantage could be that they can't (%hesitation%) study and maybe they get stressed because they they are (wor-) working and studying at the same time
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 40.28 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well in my opinion the students they could could be working and studying at the same time because you can get money
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 10.12 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well first of all you have to get any way of transport for example get on the bus
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 10.12 19.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it will take you at the airport and you have to check in

SI1267-00401-P50019 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the students use the internet because on internet there is all and they can investigate about any any topic and they can learn about all
SI1267-00401-P50020 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i think so because (%hesitation%) have a teacher with you (%hesitation%) is the better way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who help you about any question that you have
SI1267-00401-P50021 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think they could do your homeworks faster and (th-) yeah make (%hesitation%) and (ma-) making friends and get along well
SI1267-00401-P50022 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 11.47 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think so because maybe there is a professor that (%hesitation%) that (gi-) that is giving you a topic

SI1267-00401-P50023 1 SI1267-00401 0.00 17.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important because the university should have the better learning facilities of of (mat-) materials because university is the most level school
SI1267-00401-P50023 1 SI1267-00401 17.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think so
SI1267-00444-P10005 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 20.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to travel and because of this i think it's important to learn about other languages because when you are in other country if you learn this language it's more easy for you for communicate with (%hesitation%) the foreign or the the people in this
SI1267-00444-P10006 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 8.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have a soon a son and i like to spend my time with him and with my husband

SI1267-00444-P10007 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the best way i think that (%hesitation%) will be (%hesitation%) with a teacher or if i will have the opportunity to to go abroad because you (%hesitation%) you have the opportunity to practice with the the people

SI1267-00444-P10008 1 SI1267-00444 11.32 16.71 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) and there are lot of people that that know these languages
SI1267-00444-P10008 1 SI1267-00444 16.71 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's more different than than english
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 11.11 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i believe that it's important that all the students (%hesitation%) spend some time in a in a part time job while there are a student
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 11.11 19.36 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because when you are working you learn (%hesitation%) different things that you are (%hesitation%) study
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 19.36 36.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you learn how is the the real life and the responsa and you have the opportunity to be responsible with your work (%hesitation%) and this is important for for your future
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 36.22 55.15 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you also you can (%hesitation%) learn about something that is involved in your studies and with this work you you can (%hesitation%) get other knowledges different that you are learning in your in your class
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 55.15 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> disadvantages is that you need to control the time that you
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 9.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to to explain you how is produced the acid rain
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 9.60 20.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see in this picture (%hesitation%) we have a lot of fabrics (%hesitation%) factories and vehicles that produce pollution
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 20.75 31.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in this pollution (%hesitation%) there are (%hesitation%) acid particles that with the wind mixed with all cloud water
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 31.72 44.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) these particles down to the all rainforest like a rain or snow and because of this (%hesitation%) damage all environment
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 44.60 51.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so also some of these acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 51.59 60.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i think it's important to reduce this pollution to avoid problems like that
SI1267-00444-P50019 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 21.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i will tell to these people that should to eat more vegetables or fruits than other foods like fast food or something like that because these foods are very are better than the other ones
SI1267-00444-P50020 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 21.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's the same important than eat health food because we need to drink at least two litres per day to clean our bodies of the the toxic that (%hesitation%) we have in
SI1267-00444-P50021 1 SI1267-00444 0.00 13.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) i think it's important to do exercise not only eat (%hesitation%) good food or drink (%hesitation%) enough water
SI1267-00444-P50021 1 SI1267-00444 13.18 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because we need to move our bodies to have (%hesitation%) a good conditions on

SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 12.46 22.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if their parents pay for it students have to follow (par-) the educational policy
SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 22.31 35.73 <o,Q5,B2,P3> next the disadvantage of this topic is if students work very hard they don't have enough time to concentrate on their study
SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 35.73 41.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it prevent them from doing deep learning

SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 48.92 56.23 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so students have to concentrate on their studies and get skills that help their future

SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 6.64 13.53 <o,Q4,C,P4> first you have to go to the airport by using cars trains and the bus
SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 13.53 23.76 <o,Q4,C,P4> when you are when you arrive at the airport first you have to go to check in counter then you have do check in then you can get boarding pass
SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 23.76 26.73 <o,Q4,C,P4> next you have to go to document control
SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 26.73 33.13 <o,Q4,C,P4> there your passport and some documents will be checked
SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 33.13 35.86 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you have to go to security

SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 45.77 55.99 <o,Q4,C,P4> then (%hesitation%) after finishing it you can wait in the airport you can go to the cafeteria restaurant and so on
SI1267-00457-P40018 1 SI1267-00457 55.99 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and you will and then you will go to the pole and the the airplane will
SI1267-00457-P50019 1 SI1267-00457 0.00 6.84 <o,Q4,C,P5> the students can use technology by like watching youtubes or likes people that are explaining on the internet
SI1267-00457-P50019 1 SI1267-00457 6.84 12.10 <o,Q4,C,P5> so by using that (%hesitation%) they don't need to actually hire somebody to teach them what they don't know
SI1267-00457-P50019 1 SI1267-00457 12.10 16.37 <o,Q4,C,P5> they can just use the internet and to find out what they need

SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 11.96 17.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> second bees make honey from nectar in bee beehives
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 17.51 23.25 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and third (%hesitation%) beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 23.25 30.66 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then they collect (%hesitation%) honey on the on the bottle
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 30.66 45.53 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) carried about carried by car and (%hesitation%) display display (m-) merchandise
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 45.53 52.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so (%hesitation%) for (%hesitation%) in conclusion i think it is very very delicious honey
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 52.93 55.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) i think it is nice
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 55.87 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> thank you
SI1267-00458-P50019 1 SI1267-00458 0.00 14.15 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think they must they should choose another country for (%hesitation%) what they want to do (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) they they must enjoy studying
SI1267-00458-P50019 1 SI1267-00458 14.15 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) you they can't learning
SI1267-00458-P50020 1 SI1267-00458 0.00 6.97 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it is (%hesitation%) it is (%hesitation%) useful to work in the future
SI1267-00458-P50020 1 SI1267-00458 6.97 11.68 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) second (lang-) (%hesitation%) i have a second language
SI1267-00458-P50020 1 SI1267-00458 11.68 15.83 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it is very useful for works in new places
SI1267-00458-P50020 1 SI1267-00458 15.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so it's very benefits for second language
SI1267-00458-P50021 1 SI1267-00458 0.00 11.84 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think (%hesitation%) at the first time they have to speak another country language is very difficult
SI1267-00458-P50021 1 SI1267-00458 11.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) so it is (%hesitation%) they can study english very well every day
SI1267-00458-P50022 1 SI1267-00458 0.00 8.70 <o,Q4,B1,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00458-P50022 1 SI1267-00458 8.70 11.52 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and (%hesitation%) local culture is
SI1267-00458-P50022 1 SI1267-00458 11.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> there are many kind of local culture of movies so they should watch local culture movie
SI1267-00458-P50023 1 SI1267-00458 0.00 1.67 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think so too
SI1267-00458-P50023 1 SI1267-00458 1.67 8.29 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it's because (%hesitation%) in the foreign country is only alone
SI1267-00458-P50023 1 SI1267-00458 8.29 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00508-P10005 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interesting because i think culture is a good way to have experience and to create another memories and also to have experience in work and in relationships
SI1267-00508-P10006 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 5.51 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spend spend my free time watching tv series
SI1267-00508-P10006 1 SI1267-00508 5.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think i spend quite a lot watching tv serial like my favourite tv (ser-) serial is big bang theory
SI1267-00508-P10007 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 8.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other persons so i can improve my pronunciation
SI1267-00508-P10007 1 SI1267-00508 8.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also watch watch tv series on the tv for the for the learn new words
SI1267-00508-P10008 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think i would like to learn how to write but write a book or something like that because i think i am the worst in writing
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can create new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships (%hesitation%) for your work and maybe for your personal life
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 18.12 35.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you don't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it's gonna be difficult and you can forget for that you can forget about other relationship like your parents and something like that
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 35.15 49.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think it's the worst idea to lose those relationships because you focus only in your job and all the for in studying
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 49.00 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think it's the best way to have experience in the real work
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 7.81 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollution is something that in that moment is the worst for our planet
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 7.81 14.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see in the presentation factories create the that pollution and also vehicles
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 14.25 22.32 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that create of that pollution that create acids particles that that are in form like smoke
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 22.32 31.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then those particles are in the air because of the vehicles and factories
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 31.66 36.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that create acids particles that mix with cloud water
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 36.16 45.39 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that water like we can see (%hesitation%) they can is is useful for the tree
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 45.39 52.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but when that acids particles are in the rain they affect on those plants because they need water
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 52.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the water is something that in the planet is essential
SI1267-00508-P50019 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 9.31 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think people need to find someone or maybe a motivation to eat eat good
SI1267-00508-P50019 1 SI1267-00508 9.31 16.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example they don't eat good because they don't know how to cook or maybe what product they should buy
SI1267-00508-P50019 1 SI1267-00508 16.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think the right advice
SI1267-00508-P50020 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 6.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think drink lots of water is important because our body needs that
SI1267-00508-P50020 1 SI1267-00508 6.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and without waters you can have a lot of energy because you have the material
SI1267-00508-P50021 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 7.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not every day maybe three or five days a week because our body needs to rest
SI1267-00508-P50021 1 SI1267-00508 7.79 18.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and is something that a lot of people they have a different opinion because they think they need to exercise every day
SI1267-00508-P50021 1 SI1267-00508 18.05 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that's not
SI1267-00508-P50022 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 8.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we need to sleep like eight hours because our body needs to rest
SI1267-00508-P50022 1 SI1267-00508 8.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and if we don't (%hesitation%) sleep enough is gonna be difficult for us to have a good day in the next day that we wake up
SI1267-00508-P50023 1 SI1267-00508 0.00 10.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00508-P50023 1 SI1267-00508 10.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and also there are some apps that motivate people to to do excercise and drink water
SI1267-00518-P10005 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 6.31 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm not really sure but (%hesitation%) because every time of the year have good things and bad things
SI1267-00518-P10005 1 SI1267-00518 6.31 18.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think i'd say (%hesitation%) summer which is the the the time of the year where i can go to the swimming pool with my friends or to the beach doing more things
SI1267-00518-P10005 1 SI1267-00518 18.27 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there is hot and (s-) (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00518-P10006 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 6.10 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well it's bad point from my point of view but i'm not interested in news
SI1267-00518-P10006 1 SI1267-00518 6.10 10.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i see the news while i'm eating on the tv because i eat with my father
SI1267-00518-P10006 1 SI1267-00518 10.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i don't read the newspaper (%hesitation%) and i don't listen to the radio so i'm not interested in the news
SI1267-00518-P10007 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 13.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i loved going to the park with my friends which were my friends of the school and also my neighbours because all of us lived like in the same area of the city
SI1267-00518-P10007 1 SI1267-00518 13.27 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so we loved going to the park and maybe playing basket or playing with a
SI1267-00518-P10008 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 11.83 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'd like to maybe be the boss of a big company and maybe working abroad because i don't think i'd be able to work here in spain
SI1267-00518-P10008 1 SI1267-00518 11.83 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) i'd like to work in a big company with international issues maybe exportations or importations
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 6.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) practical work experience it's really important before graduating
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 6.65 10.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but not all the courses (%hesitation%) should practice this
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 10.41 25.84 <o,Q5,B2,P3> because for example in a first course you are just (%hesitation%) giving students the first notions of what they are (stu-) studying so they are not prepared to have the responsibility of do any work (%hesitation%) for any practical work experience
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 25.84 33.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but so the advantages could be that they are used to (%hesitation%) do some work to what would be their lives after graduating
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 33.92 48.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages in in (%hesitation%) junior courses or in the first courses are that they are they have not (%hesitation%) they are not (%hesitation%) form enough to do that work experience
SI1267-00518-P30017 1 SI1267-00518 48.21 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so from my point of view it's important but in the last courses like in third or four of the degree that they know what should they do if they have a problem in a work experience
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 5.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> okay so in this graph we can (%hesitation%) see three music (%hesitation%) sites
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 5.80 8.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so the first one might (%hesitation%) is tunes net
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 8.78 13.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> tunes net starting with (%hesitation%) twenty thousand of people
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 13.29 17.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it is the last website with no (%hesitation%) with less people
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 17.29 26.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but beside that in the by the base for example on the seventh day it is the the website with the most people visiting it
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 26.88 29.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then the second one is music now
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 29.71 38.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the music now started high and is still high but it has well it has increased but it is under the red line
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 38.27 56.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the third one songs for two (%hesitation%) for four you (%hesitation%) started like in the middle but it has decrease (%hesitation%) the thousand of people that watch it maybe because of the increase of tunes net or also increase of music now
SI1267-00518-P40018 1 SI1267-00518 56.35 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but (%hesitation%) under the red one which is the
SI1267-00518-P50019 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 7.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think to be a team leader you need to be (%hesitation%) compromise with the with the cause
SI1267-00518-P50019 1 SI1267-00518 7.83 10.44 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and you not need to be the boss
SI1267-00518-P50019 1 SI1267-00518 10.44 13.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't have to give (%hesitation%) orders
SI1267-00518-P50019 1 SI1267-00518 13.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to involve with the team and work with them maybe work more than them
SI1267-00518-P50020 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 9.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the problems with small teams is that well they are better comfortable and those things
SI1267-00518-P50020 1 SI1267-00518 9.11 12.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if you are less people you have to do more work per capita
SI1267-00518-P50020 1 SI1267-00518 12.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think (%hesitation%) by the way it's good to control but it's bad because you have to work more
SI1267-00518-P50021 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 17.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's very good and very healthy to get to have different opinions and different point of views because like that we can do a better job and we can share ideas that if than if we were all (%hesitation%) would that we all agree
SI1267-00518-P50021 1 SI1267-00518 17.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i don't think it's really good though
SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 5.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it doesn't have to be face to face to be in order to be effective effective
SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518 5.92 9.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i mean you can do an online (%hesitation%) reunion or whatever
SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518 9.68 18.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think it's better to do it face to face because you can (%hesitation%) you can see (%hesitation%) others' ideas more clearly
SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518 18.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think it's very
SI1267-00518-P50023 1 SI1267-00518 0.00 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i totally agree with that statement because if you are working in teams another one could be could have a better idea about what you haven't even thinked
SI1267-00518-P50023 1 SI1267-00518 10.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's really good to have other points of view to share your ideas and maybe you'd be better in other (%hesitation%) areas
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 4.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm very interesting in learning about other countries and other cultures
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521 4.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's always interesting to know culture (t-) so different from your own
SI1267-00521-P10006 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 6.64 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending my free time watching tv series or playing games or reading a book
SI1267-00521-P10006 1 SI1267-00521 6.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i also like to go to (f-) football matches with my friends
SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 11.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing speaking or practicing watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english
SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521 11.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion
SI1267-00521-P10008 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would love to learn painting so i could paint my own pictures and hang them in the in my house and maybe even give them to my friends
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 7.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i'm going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of students doing part time jobs while they are studying
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 7.38 21.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion one advantages well will be that working at the same time that studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide yourself for yourself
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 21.57 36.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could be affect negatively your academic life because maybe you're tired after after working to start to studying properly
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 36.35 38.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will affect (o-) your grades
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 38.58 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion there are (s-) some advantages to this is (%hesitation%) work while you're studying but maybe the disadvantages are worse
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 3.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to give a little talk about acid rain
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 3.55 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from the factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 12.78 15.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then those particles are carried by the wind
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 15.86 22.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of those particle fall as dust polluting lakes and our forest
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 22.02 28.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the rest of those particles mix with the cloud water and then forms clouds
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 28.41 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles goes into the (s-) into the soil polluting polluting our our trees and our forest and our lakes
SI1267-00521-P50019 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that the advice i will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be don't do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 3.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> oh i think it's very important to eat drink a lot of water
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521 3.98 7.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should try to eat at least two liters of water per day
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521 7.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 6.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well maybe not every day but at least three four times a week you should do exercise
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521 6.89 9.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there's no need to do some heavy exercise
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521 9.59 14.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you could also just go for a walk or trying some light exercise
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521 14.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> at least try to move every day
SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 4.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> oh i completely agree that (%hesitation%) we need eight hours of sleep every night
SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521 4.79 14.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> problem is that you can't always get them because you maybe have to to rise early in the morning to go to work or study
SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521 14.33 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's always complicated but definitely you should try to sleep at least eight hours
SI1267-00521-P50023 1 SI1267-00521 0.00 16.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well honestly i think that technology has have a bad impact in our in our lifestyle because it's make people more sedentary and they move move less (%hesitation%) eat worse maybe work at home
SI1267-00521-P50023 1 SI1267-00521 16.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so you just try to limit your use of (techno-)
SI1267-00550-P10005 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 9.29 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would definitely say that my favourite time of year is christmas because everyone is together
SI1267-00550-P10005 1 SI1267-00550 9.29 10.97 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we have some holidays
SI1267-00550-P10005 1 SI1267-00550 10.97 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we are (w-) looking for looking for the best gift to our parents or our
SI1267-00550-P10006 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 15.39 <o,Q5,B2,P1> personally talking i consider that are we have to stay tune of everything that is happen around us because as everyone know currently we are living in a (pan-) an a pandemic
SI1267-00550-P10006 1 SI1267-00550 15.39 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so we have to pay attention about what politicians
SI1267-00550-P10007 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 7.26 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i was seven years old i was a coach potato
SI1267-00550-P10007 1 SI1267-00550 7.26 13.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoyed being in a sofa watching cartoons
SI1267-00550-P10007 1 SI1267-00550 13.71 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but then i realised that i love the
SI1267-00550-P10008 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 16.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i said before i will love to work as a teacher because i was studying for four year my degree that's for being a teacher and i will love to be the best teacher ever
SI1267-00550-P10008 1 SI1267-00550 16.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i will
SI1267-00550-P30017 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 25.89 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some universities provide to students a period of practical work experience so some benefits of the type of activities will produce in this student (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) practical way to learn the job that they will do in the future
SI1267-00550-P30017 1 SI1267-00550 25.89 42.97 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but on the other hand maybe they could find some different with the (%hesitation%) degree that that they were studying and maybe feel a little bit depressed with how their their studies
SI1267-00550-P30017 1 SI1267-00550 42.97 54.32 <o,Q5,B1,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00550-P30017 1 SI1267-00550 54.32 56.52 <o,Q5,B1,P3> it was my vocation
SI1267-00550-P30017 1 SI1267-00550 56.52 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and i'd must to admit that is the best
SI1267-00550-P40018 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 20.42 <o,Q4,B1,P4> according to the graph related with the trainee online pop music site that we were that they were visiting during their first week online we can see that (%hesitation%) music now it was the most popular
SI1267-00550-P40018 1 SI1267-00550 20.42 37.52 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and on the other hand the tunes net starting started being the less popular one but it was the most popular during the last day the the last one
SI1267-00550-P40018 1 SI1267-00550 37.52 38.17 <o,Q4,B1,P4> ok
SI1267-00550-P40018 1 SI1267-00550 38.17 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> on the other hand the sound for you started (%hesitation%) having a rated of forty sixty visitor (%hesitation%) forty sixty thousand of people but it was an (%hesitation%) decrease during the last day having just less than twenty thousand people
SI1267-00550-P50019 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 16.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for my personal point of view i think it is has to be someone with an open minded who motivate their workers
SI1267-00550-P50019 1 SI1267-00550 16.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and at the same time it has to be in (bad-)
SI1267-00550-P50020 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 17.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one of the most common problems during work teams is the fact that some people (%hesitation%) are lazy and they avoid to focus on their work
SI1267-00550-P50020 1 SI1267-00550 17.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so the other people
SI1267-00550-P50021 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 1.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely
SI1267-00550-P50021 1 SI1267-00550 1.64 11.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think we have to be open minded in (fa-) in order to work with different people because everyone can have different aspect
SI1267-00550-P50021 1 SI1267-00550 11.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we have to listen to everybody and try to change the (w-) our work until it's perfect
SI1267-00550-P50022 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 2.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) not necessary
SI1267-00550-P50022 1 SI1267-00550 2.17 10.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> currently we are working in a (%hesitation%) problematic situation that we have to doing our work online
SI1267-00550-P50022 1 SI1267-00550 10.96 17.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) that with some application we can share our feelings our opinions
SI1267-00550-P50022 1 SI1267-00550 17.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's not necessary to work (o-)
SI1267-00550-P50023 1 SI1267-00550 0.00 16.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i couldn't agree more because from a personal point of view i think you can always learn by your partners because they don't think like you so they can have more creative ideas
SI1267-00550-P50023 1 SI1267-00550 16.35 19.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and maybe it doesn't appear on your mind
SI1267-00550-P50023 1 SI1267-00550 19.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so
SI1267-00563-P10005 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm really keen in environment because in the future if we don't look after the environment we won't have (%hesitation%) water enough water to drink or similar like that
SI1267-00563-P10006 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 7.48 <o,Q5,B1,P1> we are unalloyed fan of the cinema
SI1267-00563-P10006 1 SI1267-00563 7.48 12.61 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in fact all weekend we usually go to the cinema
SI1267-00563-P10006 1 SI1267-00563 12.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and every day some of my free (%hesitation%) friends (%hesitation%) choose one
SI1267-00563-P10007 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 7.66 <o,Q5,B1,P1> definitely i take after my grandfather
SI1267-00563-P10007 1 SI1267-00563 7.66 19.40 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in fact (%hesitation%) all all people said that i i am (%hesitation%) his son
SI1267-00563-P10007 1 SI1267-00563 19.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but not
SI1267-00563-P10008 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future in the future i would like to live in somewhere else (%hesitation%) but i don't know when exp exactly but at the moment i'd choose (%hesitation%) england i think
SI1267-00563-P30017 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 14.63 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i couldn't agree more with this sentences because the sport is one of the (m-) (%hesitation%) most important thing to feel you (%hesitation%) healthy and with energy
SI1267-00563-P30017 1 SI1267-00563 14.63 31.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in fact when you doing sport you you feel over the moon and you will have more energy to study or (%hesitation%) or doing anything
SI1267-00563-P30017 1 SI1267-00563 31.04 51.55 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) the only disadvan that i can see in this advice is that (%hesitation%) you (don-) you won't have more time to learn about other other subject (%hesitation%) like maths and language or (is-) history or similar
SI1267-00563-P30017 1 SI1267-00563 51.55 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but i think that it worth (becau-) because the sport nowadays (%hesitation%) is (cleo-)
SI1267-00563-P40018 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 12.70 <o,Q5,B1,P4> at the beginning (%hesitation%) bees (%hesitation%) collect nectar from the flowers (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) in the country
SI1267-00563-P40018 1 SI1267-00563 12.70 33.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after that (%hesitation%) these bees make honey from nectar in (beehi-) beehives and (ch-) (%hesitation%) so so beekeepers can collect honey from that beehives
SI1267-00563-P40018 1 SI1267-00563 33.49 42.26 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) after that (%hesitation%) they they manufactured (%hesitation%) the honey
SI1267-00563-P40018 1 SI1267-00563 42.26 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and they repart (%hesitation%) this honey in different shop than the customer can buy (%hesitation%) paying for them
SI1267-00563-P50019 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion they should consider (%hesitation%) the language that people speak in that country because you can you can learn this language and it will be useful for you
SI1267-00563-P50020 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 15.26 <o,Q5,B1,P5> there are a lot of advantages but the most important from my point of view is that (%hesitation%) you will able to learn other language
SI1267-00563-P50020 1 SI1267-00563 15.26 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this you can use it
SI1267-00563-P50021 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well obviously the more the most difficult thing that (%hesitation%) you will (%hesitation%) afford is the the language of the the that country because study in different language is always more difficult
SI1267-00563-P50022 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> to learn about the local culture they must meet new people from this country to learn more about their food or relationship and language
SI1267-00563-P50023 1 SI1267-00563 0.00 18.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i couldn't agree more with this advice because you must to be independent to live in other country because you will be alone and you must to do all thing alone
SI1267-00563-P50023 1 SI1267-00563 18.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> you will
SI1267-00618-P10005 1 SI1267-00618 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i interest in other language and other countries' cultures
SI1267-00618-P10006 1 SI1267-00618 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> commonly i watch some movies from netflix and i am walking near the river and i'm listening music
SI1267-00618-P10007 1 SI1267-00618 0.00 14.48 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think the best way is speaking native (%hesitation%) people and read some thing
SI1267-00618-P10007 1 SI1267-00618 14.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and it's
SI1267-00618-P10008 1 SI1267-00618 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i want to learn (%hesitation%) speak a few language easily and also (%hesitation%) i want to learn play some musical instruments
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 0.00 8.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think it's (%hesitation%) it have some good aspect aspects
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 8.50 23.36 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if you are working at the university you can earn money (%hesitation%) for yourself and you can be independent person
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 23.36 27.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also you feel so self confident
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 27.13 34.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and of course (%hesitation%) there are some disadvantages
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 34.50 45.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) you have no much time for (%hesitation%) entertainment or hanging out with friends and you can you can feel exhausted
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 45.88 55.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion yes it's it's will be (beneficia-) beneficil benefical benefical (%hesitation%) it's provided to feel independent and free
SI1267-00618-P30017 1 SI1267-00618 55.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) if you have time you can

SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 0.00 11.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> nowadays many people believe that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 11.24 16.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are both advantages and disadvantages for this
SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 16.65 33.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first of all if students gets a jobs they can earn their living and also get more (%hesitation%) money for their study expense
SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 33.62 40.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and they also can support them for their study free
SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 40.02 53.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but if they spend most of more most of their time (%hesitation%) doing part time job it can't affect badly on their study
SI1267-00650-P30017 1 SI1267-00650 53.68 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and so i think if they can join their (ti-)

SI1267-00650-P40018 1 SI1267-00650 11.13 23.53 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all they need to go to the airport by any means of transportation they can get such as car bus or train
SI1267-00650-P40018 1 SI1267-00650 23.53 39.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that they if they reach to the airport (%hesitation%) they should go to the check in board and shows their passport and something like that in the document control
SI1267-00650-P40018 1 SI1267-00650 39.91 48.93 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that they would check the their luggage their suitcase with the security (%hesitation%) employee

SI1267-00650-P50020 1 SI1267-00650 1.28 3.28 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i support this idea
SI1267-00650-P50020 1 SI1267-00650 3.28 12.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> nowaday even when we study online we comes for some problems especially if your technology is not good enough
SI1267-00650-P50020 1 SI1267-00650 12.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but when we learn face to face with our teachers she can help us to answer

SI1267-00650-P50021 1 SI1267-00650 14.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> nowaday everything we work in team if we need it
SI1267-00650-P50022 1 SI1267-00650 0.00 17.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course is (i-) is more interesting (%hesitation%) to attend lectures than to read some material some documents alone because we can hear the voice
SI1267-00650-P50022 1 SI1267-00650 17.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they can (he-)
SI1267-00650-P50023 1 SI1267-00650 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is very important for the university to provide modern learning facilities because that if they can have enough facilities (f-) such as computers lab rooms or something like that they can (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00700-P10005 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the place where i live is it's very kind because we the people are very with very facilities and also the place have a lot of culture and touristic places
SI1267-00700-P10006 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 10.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i am in holiday i love go out to vacation and go to the beach with my family
SI1267-00700-P10006 1 SI1267-00700 10.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and also i enjoy reading books about architecture
SI1267-00700-P10007 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i enjoy spending time with my brother because it's very he's very funny and also i love stay with my father but i prefer stay with my brother because he is very spontained
SI1267-00700-P10008 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i don't really see myself doing the same job as i'm doing now because i would like would really like to keep on improving and to keep on being promoted and be one of the best architects
SI1267-00700-P30017 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 5.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think in my opinion
SI1267-00700-P30017 1 SI1267-00700 5.88 37.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) to be honest i think the government needs to pay us for study because our job is to be prepared to the future and also be prepared to the objectives of the life and our objective is take a good job and also do the change in your in our area where i live
SI1267-00700-P30017 1 SI1267-00700 37.18 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think it's (%hesitation%) advantage if you can doing both but it's a disadvantage because you you need the time to learn (%hesitation%) in the (u-) university
SI1267-00700-P40018 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 18.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> we have (%hesitation%) the diagram show show the stage people need to to to travel by airplane and the first step is travel to the airport and you can go to the airport by bus and car a taxi or train
SI1267-00700-P40018 1 SI1267-00700 18.91 37.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) one time you are in the airport you need to check in and pass through document control and with the security with some questions and also the security needs to to check your to look at your package
SI1267-00700-P40018 1 SI1267-00700 37.89 40.94 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you almost finished
SI1267-00700-P40018 1 SI1267-00700 40.94 48.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you need to wait some minutes and go to bathroom or if you want to eat something is it's in this moment
SI1267-00700-P40018 1 SI1267-00700 48.82 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and wait the because when you need to where you need to aboard and and it's
SI1267-00700-P50019 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 13.37 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion like a student i we we need to technology to improve our skills and also to improve our knowledge
SI1267-00700-P50019 1 SI1267-00700 13.37 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because we when we have wherever i went we went

SI1267-00700-P50020 1 SI1267-00700 7.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i am sure that well in my opinion i prefer the classes face to face with a teacher because we (w-) we can have a better explanation
SI1267-00700-P50021 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i preferred to work alone but the group projects i know that helps us about to be a leader and also to understand how the other options (%hesitation%) could be good
SI1267-00700-P50022 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course i think the attending lecture are very good because you can have an explanation about all the topic and also understand how it would be a better comprehension
SI1267-00700-P50023 1 SI1267-00700 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that the way to everyone learn is very different so i think the learning facilities could be (%hesitation%) can (w-) will be change because everyone have their manner to learn
SI1267-00712-P10005 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
SI1267-00712-P10006 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 6.08 <o,Q4,C,P1> i enjoy spending my free time with my kids with my husband my family
SI1267-00712-P10006 1 SI1267-00712 6.08 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i love also reading books watching series on netflix and eating a good meal with my family
SI1267-00712-P10007 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> the best way to improve my english is consistency and have (%hesitation%) other people i can practice with
SI1267-00712-P10008 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would love to learn embroidered and i would love to improve my studying skills
SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 9.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> we see many university students working part time jobs while they are studying and i think there are many advantages to that
SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712 9.52 24.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) students firstly would have their own income and that would allow them some economical independence from their parents as well as becoming more responsible in their (%hesitation%) money management
SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712 24.37 39.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantage though is that if they need to work while attending classes as they would have to time manage between (%hesitation%) their work duties and their (%hesitation%) university responsibilities
SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712 39.72 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i think it's better if the students university students do part time work while (%hesitation%) they are studying but i would advise them to do so during their summer breaks or (%hesitation%) as they would get the best of both worlds
SI1267-00712-P40018 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 9.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) one of the many problems caused by air pollution it is certainly acid rain
SI1267-00712-P40018 1 SI1267-00712 9.04 22.69 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) in areas where there are many factories and vehicles these (%hesitation%) they can release a lot of pollution to the air that contain acid (par-) particles that go up in the form of the smoke
SI1267-00712-P40018 1 SI1267-00712 22.69 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) these (ass-) acid particles are carried by the wind and some of them (%hesitation%) fall as dust but others (%hesitation%) get mixed with clouds (%hesitation%) with clouds and that can in turn fall as in the shape of rain or snow causing damage to the environment such as crops and water supplies
SI1267-00712-P50019 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 5.51 <o,Q5,C,P5> the first advice on eating is start to include your five a day in your diet
SI1267-00712-P50019 1 SI1267-00712 5.51 14.20 <o,Q5,C,P5> and another (%hesitation%) very important step is to cut out (%hesitation%) junk food and sugary foods from your meals
SI1267-00712-P50019 1 SI1267-00712 14.20 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> try to stick to three meals a day and healthy snacks in between
SI1267-00712-P50020 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 5.65 <o,Q5,C,P5> experts say we should aim to drink about two liters of water a day
SI1267-00712-P50020 1 SI1267-00712 5.65 9.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's very important to keep our bodies hydrated and functioning well
SI1267-00712-P50020 1 SI1267-00712 9.98 13.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) that will help (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00712-P50020 1 SI1267-00712 13.11 17.62 <o,Q5,C,P5> like for me anyway if i don't drink water i get headaches and things like this
SI1267-00712-P50020 1 SI1267-00712 17.62 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's important keep our bodies hydrated
SI1267-00712-P50021 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 5.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think it's essential to do exercise (%hesitation%) every day
SI1267-00712-P50021 1 SI1267-00712 5.95 11.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's important to have a regular and consistent routine
SI1267-00712-P50021 1 SI1267-00712 11.44 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> experts said we should do at least three (%hesitation%) exercise three days a week and i think that would be a good focus
SI1267-00712-P50022 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 7.29 <o,Q5,C,P5> i wouldn't say everyone needs at (l-) (%hesitation%) eight hours' sleep (%hesitation%) per night
SI1267-00712-P50022 1 SI1267-00712 7.29 13.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i know that i work better if i have between eight or nine hours' sleep
SI1267-00712-P50022 1 SI1267-00712 13.44 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but i know some people that cannot sleep any more than six or seven hours
SI1267-00712-P50023 1 SI1267-00712 0.00 14.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> generally speaking i think a little negative but that's because we don't know how to control ourselves and to put limits in the amount of time we (spe-) we spend in front of screens be that the phone the tv or computers
SI1267-00712-P50023 1 SI1267-00712 14.88 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but if we know how to manage our time i think technology is great
SI1267-00753-P10005 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 5.89 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i'm really interested in the environment and (%hesitation%) right now is is pretty sad
SI1267-00753-P10005 1 SI1267-00753 5.89 9.58 <o,Q5,B1,P1> would say that the environment is being damaged
SI1267-00753-P10005 1 SI1267-00753 9.58 15.24 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so i definitely definitely think that we need to take action right now to protect our environment
SI1267-00753-P10005 1 SI1267-00753 15.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> because so doing that we can protect our own (f-)
SI1267-00753-P10006 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 4.71 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well we often doing some sports during the free time
SI1267-00753-P10006 1 SI1267-00753 4.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so doing this not only can we (%hesitation%) can we keep (hi-) keep fit but also we can develop our friendship which is i think really great
SI1267-00753-P10007 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 9.42 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think i am most similar i am mostly similar to my dad because we often read books together
SI1267-00753-P10007 1 SI1267-00753 9.42 12.98 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and we both love writing articles

SI1267-00753-P10007 1 SI1267-00753 17.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> yeah well we all like
SI1267-00753-P10008 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 9.04 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well i like to live in new york in the future because new york is a really multiculture city
SI1267-00753-P10008 1 SI1267-00753 9.04 17.30 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and in fact i visit new york once last year and i was really amazed by the by the city
SI1267-00753-P10008 1 SI1267-00753 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> new york is a great city
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 10.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some (s-) schools and colleges (%hesitation%) think that they should make time in the school day for all students do fitness classes
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 10.18 14.51 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well there are definitely some advantages to do this
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 14.51 28.81 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example through doing sports not only can students keep fit but also they can learn how to do the teamwork which is very important to their future career
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 28.81 31.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however (%hesitation%) every coin has two sides
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 31.41 33.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are some disadvantages as well
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 33.83 42.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) for example spending too much time (%hesitation%) doing sports may result in a poor academic performance
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 42.08 52.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so as far as i'm concerned it is essential for students to learn how to balance schoolwork and sports
SI1267-00753-P30017 1 SI1267-00753 52.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> only in this way can they have a better future

SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 1.41 5.58 <o,Q5,B1,P4> today we are going to talk about how honey is made
SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 5.58 14.96 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and then they make honey from nectars in beehives
SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 14.96 23.24 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after several days beekeepers collect honey from (%hesitation%) beehives and then they will put them into jars
SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 23.24 41.92 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and once this procedure is done these jars will be putted onto the vehicles and they will be delivered to supermarkets all around the country where you can buy them and take home and enjoy them
SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 41.92 44.66 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so this is how honey is made
SI1267-00753-P40018 1 SI1267-00753 44.66 48.73 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this is how honey come from flowers to the shop

SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 5.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well students need to consider a lot of things to choose a country
SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753 5.45 17.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example they may consider how whether they like the food in in those countries whether the weather is great and so on
SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753 17.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there is a lot to consider
SI1267-00753-P50020 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well studying a second language can definitely benefit the students a lot because through learning the the language they can have a deeper (%hesitation%) understanding about the foreign culture which is i think really important to
SI1267-00753-P50021 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think (stu-) (stu-) foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural difference can prevent them from being together
SI1267-00753-P50022 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have have lived in this country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding about their culture
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753 0.00 13.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well studying abroad can definitely help a student (beco-) become independence because in a foreign country there is no relatives and you need to solve all the questions on your own
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753 13.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot

SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 6.89 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i am on holidays i enjoy relaxing of course
SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797 6.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy swimming to the beach or to the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the the city where i am
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 9.43 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because (%hesitation%) we have (%hesitation%) similar interests
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797 9.43 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so (%hesitation%) all every every day we play together (%hesitation%) with (%hesitation%) video games
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 6.49 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like (%hesitation%) to job (%hesitation%) as a occupational therapist
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 6.49 9.63 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) actually i am studying for that
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 9.63 14.83 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but i would like to job as a physiotherapist too
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 14.83 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's my one of my dream so i would like to to get
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 17.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion (%hesitation%) i think that it's normal that (%hesitation%) students (%hesitation%) get jobs to pay (%hesitation%) their university studies (%hesitation%) because actually (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) university studies (%hesitation%) are very expensive
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 17.53 30.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> the (advan-) advantage (%hesitation%) is that you will (%hesitation%) earn money (%hesitation%) easily (%hesitation%) because you are working
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 30.48 44.11 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) the the disadvantage is that you haven't (%hesitation%) got a lot of time to to prepare your (%hesitation%) your subjects in the university
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 44.11 49.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> so (%hesitation%) you have (%hesitation%) less time (%hesitation%) than other
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 49.36 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think that it's normal because (%hesitation%) university studies (%hesitation%) are very expensive but (%hesitation%) it's very hard to do this
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 8.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> firstly you need to travel to airport and go (%hesitation%) to do the check in
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 8.33 28.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you give (%hesitation%) your document control to the person (%hesitation%) the security (%hesitation%) say (%hesitation%) say you that you need to wait (%hesitation%) for board at the plane
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 28.46 36.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you are waiting you can drink or eat or other or go to the toilets
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 36.79 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and when (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) called you to board at the plane you will (%hesitation%) take off (%hesitation%) and go when you want to to go
SI1267-00797-P50019 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that with the technology you can (%hesitation%) look about (%hesitation%) more information (%hesitation%) on internet and doing your homework (%hesitation%) in your computer (%hesitation%) with word or other apps (%hesitation%) of microsoft
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 8.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's a good option to understand all doubts (%hesitation%) doubts that you have
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797 8.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand anything in relation with the (%hesitation%) unit that you are studying a teacher could (%hesitation%) help you
SI1267-00797-P50021 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that working in group projects (%hesitation%) will improve your (%hesitation%) communication and (organis-) organisation skills and this help you in the future to work in a business or other things
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 8.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that attending lectures (%hesitation%) it's a good option to understand things that you don't know
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797 8.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand what the teacher (%hesitation%) has said (%hesitation%) attending lecture (%hesitation%) will help you for that
SI1267-00797-P50023 1 SI1267-00797 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (univer-) universities (%hesitation%) want to improve these modern learning facilities because (%hesitation%) thank of that (%hesitation%) the (s-) students (%hesitation%) could (%hesitation%) understand more easily all the information
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 4.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time of the year is absolutely (%hesitation%) christmas
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 4.49 10.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love the atmosphere but also the cold atmosphere
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 10.52 15.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the weather (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) snow (%hesitation%) also rain
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 15.04 16.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really like rain
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 16.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) well i think it's the best time of the year
SI1267-00809-P10006 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's really important to read news (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) the local ones (%hesitation%) newspapers but also in the the web (%hesitation%) on internet
SI1267-00809-P10006 1 SI1267-00809 10.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) in particular i am (%hesitation%) not interested in (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) bad news but only that (%hesitation%) involves economy politic
SI1267-00809-P10007 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 6.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i was a child (%hesitation%) i really loved (%hesitation%) i really like to stay in contact with nature
SI1267-00809-P10007 1 SI1267-00809 6.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i always (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i was always outside outdoor (%hesitation%) playing (%hesitation%) ball (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) i don't know maybe use the rope
SI1267-00809-P10008 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 8.50 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i would like to (%hesitation%) become (%hesitation%) an engineering an engineer in particular (%hesitation%) a biomedical ones
SI1267-00809-P10008 1 SI1267-00809 8.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) in the last (%hesitation%) few week (%hesitation%) i decided to attend (%hesitation%) a (%hesitation%) mechanical (%hesitation%) course (%hesitation%) in my
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 8.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i completely agree with the fact that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 8.41 32.10 <o,Q4,C,P3> indeed i think that the main advantage the main advantage of (%hesitation%) these of (%hesitation%) include a period of practical work experience (%hesitation%) consider (%hesitation%) the fact that (%hesitation%) probably after this (%hesitation%) practical work experience (%hesitation%) students can find (j-) can find a job and also improve (%hesitation%) their practical (%hesitation%) ability
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 32.10 49.24 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think well the main disadvantage of (%hesitation%) these (%hesitation%) this factor is the fact that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) probably peoples will think that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it's like a waste of time and because they can study (%hesitation%) while they were working
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 49.24 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> well in my opinion i (%hesitation%) i would like to (%hesitation%) include (%hesitation%) a period of practical work (%hesitation%) during my studies
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> these graph (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) shows (%hesitation%) shows the number of people visiting (%hesitation%) these (%hesitation%) three different sites tunes net music now songs for you during their first week online
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 13.39 32.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) we can see that (%hesitation%) in the (%hesitation%) vertical axis (%hesitation%) there (%hesitation%) there (i-) (%hesitation%) there are the percentage of thousand of people and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) the days of the week (%hesitation%) are shows are showed shown in (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) horizontal one
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 32.31 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> we can see that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) from (%hesitation%) the fifth day to the seven days (%hesitation%) tunes net had a (%hesitation%) climb (%hesitation%) are not and (%hesitation%) and there is a drop (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) for example in (%hesitation%) for the songs for you (%hesitation%) a slightly drop (%hesitation%) for music now
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 14.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the main characteristic of a team leaders are (%hesitation%) ambitious (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) also (%hesitation%) collaboration and (%hesitation%) enthusiasm
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809 14.36 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that these three are the most important characteristic of team leaders
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 4.15 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think there is only one problem with a small team
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809 4.15 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) all all well the fact that (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) if a group (%hesitation%) are small (%hesitation%) probably there are were only few ideas
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809 17.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and this is a disadvantage
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 3.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important things is the collaboration
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809 3.96 13.58 <o,Q4,C,P5> obviously (%hesitation%) members can't (%hesitation%) always (%hesitation%) agree (o-) one another agree with (%hesitation%) the sentence of other member
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809 13.58 18.87 <o,Q4,C,P5> but (%hesitation%) it's important to come up with a conclusion to a conclusion
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809 18.87 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and (%hesitation%)
SI1267-00809-P50022 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 13.27 <o,Q4,C,P5> yeah i think that (%hesitation%) it's (%hesitation%) very important create a face to face team (%hesitation%) than a rather than a (%hesitation%) online (%hesitation%) group
SI1267-00809-P50022 1 SI1267-00809 13.27 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that face to face team (%hesitation%) could create (%hesitation%) more collaboration
SI1267-00809-P50023 1 SI1267-00809 0.00 2.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> i completely agree with this sentence
SI1267-00809-P50023 1 SI1267-00809 2.73 17.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) the best results (%hesitation%) for group (%hesitation%) are (%hesitation%) are possible if only they (%hesitation%) collaborate (%hesitation%) and they are open minded and they accept others' ideas
SI1267-00809-P50023 1 SI1267-00809 17.84 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> alone maybe there
SI1267-00810-P10006 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 6.06 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i always (%hesitation%) eat dinner or go shopping with my family

SI1267-00810-P10007 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 2.22 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's my mom
SI1267-00810-P10007 1 SI1267-00810 2.22 7.18 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i always share my (%hesitation%) daily life with my mom
SI1267-00810-P10007 1 SI1267-00810 7.18 11.27 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and then she always provide me some suggestion
SI1267-00810-P10007 1 SI1267-00810 11.27 14.59 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so we are very familiar in this

SI1267-00810-P10008 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 8.96 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) in a future i think i also (lo-) love to live in taiwan because i think that taiwan is very safety for meet

SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 4.55 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the honey from flower to shot
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 4.55 10.36 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the first thing is that a bee collect nectar from flowers
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 10.36 15.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the bees make honey from nectar in beeshifts
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 15.02 20.52 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and after that the beekeeper collect honey from the beeshifts
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 20.52 28.29 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the (%hesitation%) beekeepers make the honey and they put the honey into the jam
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 28.29 34.58 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and after that there is a car on delivery honey to the shot
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 34.58 37.62 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so the shot sell the honey
SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 37.62 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so is a process that the honey (%hesitation%) make from flower to shop
SI1267-00810-P50019 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 3.90 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think need language is an important thing

SI1267-00810-P50022 1 SI1267-00810 0.00 7.97 <o,Q4,B1,P5> maybe the students can join some (%hesitation%) club or some festival in holidays

SI1267-00826-P10008 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 7.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm not very sure about this answer because i'm not (%hesitation%) one hundred percent
SI1267-00826-P10008 1 SI1267-00826 7.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i think a great job for me is (%hesitation%) work in laboratory or maybe a company that dedicates make drugs (%hesitation%) for other people to help
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 16.07 <o,Q4,C,P3> well one advantage that i found to get a job to pay the university is that it makes if the (stu-) it make the students (%hesitation%) more independent
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 16.07 26.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> so they (%hesitation%) apart they pay the university they also buy the everything they want
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 26.13 33.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> but one disadvantage is they maybe spend more time in their job that in their studies
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 33.95 51.38 <o,Q4,C,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) if they have the time to work to get a job to invest time in in their job they can do it
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 51.38 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but if they don't have this time it's better if they just (%hesitation%) focus on their studies

SI1267-00826-P40018 1 SI1267-00826 2.06 8.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well i will explain what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI1267-00826-P40018 1 SI1267-00826 8.59 16.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so the first step that you need to do is to arrive to the airport minimum two or three hours before your flight
SI1267-00826-P40018 1 SI1267-00826 16.42 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that you need to check in
SI1267-00826-P40018 1 SI1267-00826 19.20 52.94 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you need to present your passport your visa and all the documents that you have to present to for for the check in to follow to the document control (%hesitation%) and pass for the security (%hesitation%) to check (%hesitation%) your equipment your your your equipage and then to wait the two or three hours for any (%hesitation%) any doubt any problem that the plane have
SI1267-00826-P40018 1 SI1267-00826 52.94 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally you need to board when the the signal has
SI1267-00826-P50019 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 14.27 <o,Q4,C,P5> nowadays technology is one of the most important (%hesitation%) tool to learn because they can find a lot of information in the internet
SI1267-00826-P50019 1 SI1267-00826 14.27 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so the technology like computer like cellphones is (%hesitation%) very
SI1267-00826-P50020 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my experience i think that is it (%hesitation%) it is correct because now with the online classes the learning is most difficult (%hesitation%) it's more difficult and i think the face to face is better
SI1267-00826-P50021 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 10.15 <o,Q4,C,P5> one skill that i consider all students can develop is the teamwork
SI1267-00826-P50021 1 SI1267-00826 10.15 18.98 <o,Q4,C,P5> the teamwork for the for for their jobs is an important skill that they can construct and build
SI1267-00826-P50021 1 SI1267-00826 18.98 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and
SI1267-00826-P50022 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 4.56 <o,Q4,C,P5> well it depends of each student
SI1267-00826-P50022 1 SI1267-00826 4.56 15.18 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example for me it's more effective read alone because i don't (%hesitation%) distract with other things
SI1267-00826-P50022 1 SI1267-00826 15.18 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but for other students it's more effective read in groups
SI1267-00826-P50023 1 SI1267-00826 0.00 5.65 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's it's important but maybe not the most important
SI1267-00826-P50023 1 SI1267-00826 5.65 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) it's (%hesitation%) it's well known that without learning facilities like labs like (%hesitation%) rooms like library it's it's ok but

SI1267-00828-P50022 1 SI1267-00828 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that with attending lectures the students learn different things that alone don't don't stop to learn
SI1267-00828-P50023 1 SI1267-00828 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's important because the world are change and the students needs modern learning facilities to learn more and different things to the future

SI1267-00862-P30017 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 9.68 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion it's great that some students want to get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI1267-00862-P30017 1 SI1267-00862 9.68 20.39 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think that is a great way to earn experience and earn more money to in order to help them pay for their university fees
SI1267-00862-P30017 1 SI1267-00862 20.39 37.70 <o,Q4,C,P3> but also on the other hand i think that they that way if they get a job they are (%hesitation%) wasting time on doing like i'm going to work when they should be or could be studying
SI1267-00862-P30017 1 SI1267-00862 37.70 56.72 <o,Q4,C,P3> and in my opinion if they have the like you know if they have enough money to pay for their university fees without troubling their family i think they wouldn't have to get a job if they don't wanna but if they do need the money i think it's a great idea
SI1267-00862-P30017 1 SI1267-00862 56.72 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> and it gives them good

SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 9.64 13.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> first of all you get a travel to the airport
SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 13.59 19.20 <o,Q4,C,P4> then once you are already there you should do the check in
SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 19.20 34.25 <o,Q4,C,P4> after that you go to document control where a guard should check your documents and see everything is clear and in order and valid
SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 34.25 45.56 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you should move to security will they why where they revise and they check your your luggage
SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 45.56 48.83 <o,Q4,C,P4> and after that you just have to wait
SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 48.83 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and when they tell you to you should board the plane and get ready because the airplane would launch soon
SI1267-00862-P50019 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 6.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think technology is a great way to improve your studying techniques
SI1267-00862-P50019 1 SI1267-00862 6.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because in the internet we have lots of available lots of contents and information available that will help us to get the information
SI1267-00862-P50020 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 17.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that human interaction can't be changed or replaced by technology so i think face to face interactions with a teacher is best is the best way to learn
SI1267-00862-P50020 1 SI1267-00862 17.09 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's better than doing it
SI1267-00862-P50021 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that by working group projects students learn how to co operate how to share and divide work in order to get something done (fa-) more more fast faster
SI1267-00862-P50022 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 13.99 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion if the person who is giving the lecture is a good speaker i think attending lectures is the best way to get the information right and to understand everything
SI1267-00862-P50022 1 SI1267-00862 13.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because when doing it on your own you could have like different
SI1267-00862-P50023 1 SI1267-00862 0.00 9.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the university should adapt to the world is this growing and improving
SI1267-00862-P50023 1 SI1267-00862 9.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think that giving facilities like wifi or or free books for the students is a good way to
SI1267-01003-P10005 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries' culture because it is very interesting for me learning about other things other customs traditions

SI1267-01003-P30017 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 13.75 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that the advantages of (%hesitation%) do part time jobs while you are an student is that you can be prepare for real life and the problems that which haves (%hesitation%) solutions to problems
SI1267-01003-P30017 1 SI1267-01003 13.75 23.16 <o,Q4,B1,P3> some disadvantages is that the students need to organise the your time very well to study and for the part time jobs
SI1267-01003-P30017 1 SI1267-01003 23.16 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and i think that university students shouldn't (%hesitation%) do part time jobs because they need to be concentrated on the what they are studying

SI1267-01003-P40018 1 SI1267-01003 12.63 17.18 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the acid particles (%hesitation%) are in smoke

SI1267-01003-P50019 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> a recommendation that i can give the person is that (%hesitation%) if he or she wants she can go or he can go to a nutritionist to give or her give him or her tips for his or her eating habits
SI1267-01003-P50020 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of water in the seventeen percent so that is why all doctors recommend to drink almost two liters of water a day
SI1267-01003-P50021 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well some recommendations (%hesitation%) in my point of view doing exercises every day it's an option but you can also do twice or three times a week
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003 0.00 9.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is very important the time of sleeping because there is when we recharge our batteries or our energies
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003 9.32 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is very recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours

SI1267-01027-P10005 1 SI1267-01027 5.85 9.70 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so at summer we usually just bike down to the beach
SI1267-01027-P10005 1 SI1267-01027 9.70 16.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's really sunny here but sometimes it's a bit windy and it's blowing really hard

SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 11.31 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't know at the moment but i'm thinking about becoming a doctor but i'm thinking about it because you know to become a doctor you have to study a lot
SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 11.31 15.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's a lot of math and it's just really hard
SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 15.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i'm still thinking about it
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 13.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if there are many jobs that are available this is really great opportunity for all the students to get jobs to pay their university student studies
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 13.29 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but some students do also have parents who pay for their university studies which is not as good
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 20.88 33.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you're studying at the same time it can affect your grade in a bad way
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 33.43 46.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion it's good to get job to pay for your university studies so that you don't have to borrow (%hesitation%) or (le-) lend money from your parents or the bank
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 46.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) yeah not good to lend money but it's not good either if you're failing your tests
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 7.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so before you travelling by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 7.55 11.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so you can choose between car bus or train
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 11.30 25.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i recommend taking bus or train because if you're (%hesitation%) driving with car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it's not worth if you're paying for a ticket
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 25.77 35.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) when you (a-) arrive at the airport you have to check in and they will go through document control and security and your baggage
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 35.30 44.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go (%hesitation%) to the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 44.20 48.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when your plane has arrived it's time to board
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 48.33 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up to the sky
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 4.38 <o,Q4,C,P5> you can go on to websites to find feedback
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027 4.38 12.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) technology (%hesitation%) you can write on computers which is much easier than to write on paper
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027 12.40 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but i (%hesitation%) recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 2.86 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think exactly the same same
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027 2.86 7.17 <o,Q4,C,P5> during this pandemic we have been having online classes the whole time
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027 7.17 14.12 <o,Q4,C,P5> and it has been a lot harder to understand what teachers are talking about when you're asking questions
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027 14.12 19.23 <o,Q4,C,P5> is also a lot harder for them to understand when you guys are not face to face
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027 19.23 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> (d-)
SI1267-01027-P50021 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 14.75 <o,Q4,C,P5> (%hesitation%) the skills that i am thinking about first is by discussing and basically just taking others' opinions and melt them in together to a big opinion that is really good
SI1267-01027-P50021 1 SI1267-01027 14.75 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> you know you can take other (%hesitation%) ideas from others and build your own
SI1267-01027-P50022 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 1.91 <o,Q4,C,P5> sometimes yeah
SI1267-01027-P50022 1 SI1267-01027 1.91 17.06 <o,Q4,C,P5> it (de-) it's depending on like which subject and what it is about but attending lectures is a really good way than to study alone because (%hesitation%) lectures are not available the whole time but you can always study by yourself
SI1267-01027-P50022 1 SI1267-01027 17.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so if you have chance do it
SI1267-01027-P50023 1 SI1267-01027 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> according to me it's really important (%hesitation%) for the students to have a great modern learning facility for them to concentrate and the a facility that works for everyone and that will be silent modern technology for everyone to work
SI1267-01062-P10005 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 4.06 <o,Q4,B1,P1> barcelona is so beautiful it's amazing
SI1267-01062-P10005 1 SI1267-01062 4.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but based on my opinion i think there is so much pollution and so many people

SI1267-01062-P30017 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 7.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> based on my opinion we have a lot of advantages of (%hesitation%) working and study at the same time
SI1267-01062-P30017 1 SI1267-01062 7.60 18.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example (%hesitation%) you will be more efficient more organised you will appreciate your (%hesitation%) spare time as well
SI1267-01062-P30017 1 SI1267-01062 18.91 27.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) and of course earning money is so difficult nowadays you have to appreciate it
SI1267-01062-P30017 1 SI1267-01062 27.45 31.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantages is the time

SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 5.71 9.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> to get to the airport is not very difficult
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 9.09 10.92 <o,Q4,C,P4> quite the opposite it's simple
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 10.92 15.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) you need to get there by bus by car or by train
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 15.57 22.51 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you are there you have to do the check in and leave your big suitcase
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 22.51 29.53 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will pass document control where you have to be ready with your i d and your passport
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 29.53 37.50 <o,Q4,C,P4> if everything is ok you will go to the security where a guard will check your belongings
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 37.50 41.19 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then the all you have do is waiting
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 41.19 46.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can take a coffee you can go shopping you can go to the bathroom take (%hesitation%) some food
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 46.95 51.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> and when thirty minutes (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) before you will go to your gate
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 51.94 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) you will go into your plane and the all you have to do is to enjoy your journey
SI1267-01062-P50019 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 10.19 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i reckon google is a really good app to search different information and to learn new things but just if you know how to use it
SI1267-01062-P50019 1 SI1267-01062 10.19 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> so i suggest searching in different websites
SI1267-01062-P50020 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i reckon face to face is much better because based on my opinion that i am studying a master online it's so difficult when have doubts
SI1267-01062-P50020 1 SI1267-01062 11.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i have to write an email and wait (%hesitation%) one day until someone reply to my email
SI1267-01062-P50021 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 16.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> although i consider myself as a individual person i know that working in groups is much better because you have new ideas you are more efficient you can talk with more people
SI1267-01062-P50021 1 SI1267-01062 16.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's better
SI1267-01062-P50022 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 17.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> based on my opinion i think it's much better reading alone because for me i hate reading with noises around me or someone who is talking about another thing or different kind of noises
SI1267-01062-P50022 1 SI1267-01062 17.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's so annoying
SI1267-01062-P50023 1 SI1267-01062 0.00 5.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the world is changing day to day and we can't stay on the past
SI1267-01062-P50023 1 SI1267-01062 5.84 13.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we have to look at the future and we have to learn new facilities new modern facilities
SI1267-01062-P50023 1 SI1267-01062 13.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) this is the way that we are going to learn new things obviously
SI1267-01078-P10005 1 SI1267-01078 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> a lovely country style cottage

SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 0.00 10.97 <o,Q3,B2,P3> working while studying can be great way for you to make a little bit of extra money although it does have its disadvantage
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 10.97 17.11 <o,Q3,B2,P3> those are usually drastically outweighed by the benefit that it brings
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 17.11 23.07 <o,Q3,B2,P3> that probably why nearly eighty percent of student work part time while studying
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 23.07 27.24 <o,Q3,B2,P3> of course it's not necessary the right decision for everyone
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 27.24 38.27 <o,Q3,B2,P3> and there's a real risk that if you spend much time working and not enough time studying you may not achieve the grade that you were aiming for
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 38.27 52.36 <o,Q3,B2,P3> as with most thing in life the key to success is to have a healthy balance which is why it's good idea to limit your working hours if you do decide to take on a job while studying
SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 52.36 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but we recommend it if you can and here's why

SI1267-01109-P30017 1 SI1267-01109 43.18 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion if the student have their spare time they can choose to have a part time job so it can it can both improve their independence and also have the (ti-)

SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 9.10 16.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first you can travel to the airport by any transportation you like
SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 16.56 27.68 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after arrived in the air port you should check in first and then go through the document control
SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 27.68 36.41 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after the security permission you need to wait for the plane arrival arrive
SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 36.41 46.11 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that you can board in the airplane
SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 46.11 52.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you just wait for the plane to take off
SI1267-01109-P40018 1 SI1267-01109 52.73 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> stop
SI1267-01109-P50019 1 SI1267-01109 0.00 14.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (peop-) students can use computer and to surf surfer on the internet to learn some topics they are interested in
SI1267-01109-P50019 1 SI1267-01109 14.07 20.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> that will be very effective
SI1267-01109-P50020 1 SI1267-01109 0.00 3.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well it depends
SI1267-01109-P50020 1 SI1267-01109 3.44 11.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> some people they like to sit with their (%hesitation%) teachers and discuss with their teachers face to face
SI1267-01109-P50020 1 SI1267-01109 11.86 13.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that will be (%hesitation%) it
SI1267-01109-P50020 1 SI1267-01109 13.50 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but for others they will feel shy and they like to stay at home and do
SI1267-01109-P50021 1 SI1267-01109 0.00 11.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by doing group projects people can learn a lot of (%hesitation%) new knowledge and new way of thinking from the other students
SI1267-01109-P50021 1 SI1267-01109 11.73 20.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and that's a very good model for their learning
SI1267-01109-P50022 1 SI1267-01109 0.00 11.65 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion go to the classroom and attending the lectures is more effective than (%hesitation%) reading alone at home
SI1267-01109-P50022 1 SI1267-01109 11.65 18.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because if you come across some problem you can raise your hand and ask questions immediately
SI1267-01109-P50022 1 SI1267-01109 18.34 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that will be very

SI1267-01115-P10006 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 13.88 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i am on my holiday i enjoy travelling other countries and do something i've never done

SI1267-01115-P30017 1 SI1267-01115 23.60 37.53 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if there had there has advantages they can they can learn how they ground their selves
SI1267-01115-P30017 1 SI1267-01115 37.53 46.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and disadvantages you they can't concentrate on their future studies
SI1267-01115-P30017 1 SI1267-01115 46.17 53.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion they can have it both both
SI1267-01115-P30017 1 SI1267-01115 53.93 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but they should concentrate on studies than working

SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 8.37 24.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you firstly you (trave-) you should travel to airport by yourself by your car by bus or by tube
SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 24.82 35.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then you should check in with your with your flight staff
SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 35.26 47.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and you should you should submit your passport valid passport to document control staff
SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 47.59 52.43 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and also you should be checked by security guard
SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 52.43 57.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you wait till you board your airplane
SI1267-01115-P40018 1 SI1267-01115 57.56 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and that's it
SI1267-01115-P50019 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> use technology for their studies by e learning or using their application individually so they can study in their house
SI1267-01115-P50020 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 6.64 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well some people say face to face learning is very effective
SI1267-01115-P50020 1 SI1267-01115 6.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but also self doing self study or doing a study get together is also (effecti-)
SI1267-01115-P50021 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> project can make us provide make us grow the knowledge grow the knowledge from others and the
SI1267-01115-P50022 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 9.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think attending (l-) lecture is important as much as reading your reading a book by yourself
SI1267-01115-P50022 1 SI1267-01115 9.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but you need to read books (re-) you need to read the books and then attending lecture is more effective to to
SI1267-01115-P50023 1 SI1267-01115 0.00 15.14 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well providing modern learning facilities from university is not so (im-) important for me for me because you can study anywhere everywhere
SI1267-01115-P50023 1 SI1267-01115 15.14 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so you don't need to choose by learning (facili-)
SI1267-01177-P10005 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 10.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well it's a difficult question to answer because i love christmas and summer but if i have to choose between one of them i would say (%hesitation%) summer
SI1267-01177-P10005 1 SI1267-01177 10.23 19.11 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i think that for several reasons because (%hesitation%) when summer i am on vacation so i spend a lot of time on the beach and with my family
SI1267-01177-P10005 1 SI1267-01177 19.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i would
SI1267-01177-P10006 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 4.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> to tell you the truth it's super important in fact
SI1267-01177-P10006 1 SI1267-01177 4.15 11.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when (%hesitation%) when i wake up in the morning and i go to the office i try to listen to the radio every day
SI1267-01177-P10006 1 SI1267-01177 11.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and always i try to read to find newspapers as well as i trying to use (twi-) twitter for us
SI1267-01177-P10007 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 14.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well when i was a child i used to go to the beach given that i spent a lot of time with my cousins (tha-) who who were living in another city and with my grandparents
SI1267-01177-P10007 1 SI1267-01177 14.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> let's say that it was the perfect moment to have all the family close and to spend a lot of time with them
SI1267-01177-P10008 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 2.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that's a difficult question to answer
SI1267-01177-P10008 1 SI1267-01177 2.52 9.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i would like to know it but i would like to work on in a in an embassy or consulate
SI1267-01177-P10008 1 SI1267-01177 9.61 13.30 <o,Q5,B2,P1> there are i'm striving to improve my english to get this job
SI1267-01177-P10008 1 SI1267-01177 13.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i know i hope it something i hope everything work out well for me
SI1267-01177-P30017 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 10.09 <o,Q4,C,P3> well to begin with this question i would like to shed light on the fact that everyone should work a little while as you are a student
SI1267-01177-P30017 1 SI1267-01177 10.09 22.45 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) we (talki-) if we talk about the advantages i would say that you're going to earn a salary you are going to learn experience and trust me when i say that this is something crucial
SI1267-01177-P30017 1 SI1267-01177 22.45 44.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> if we talk about the disadvantages i would say that maybe you will have to to spend a lot of time working and for this reason maybe you you're maybe you fail in your degrees to speak well not to fail but at least to maybe you will have less grade
SI1267-01177-P30017 1 SI1267-01177 44.64 51.51 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) as far as i am concerned i would say that this is an experience that i recommend to everyone
SI1267-01177-P30017 1 SI1267-01177 51.51 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> it should be mandatory if if you are studying a degree because i would say that it's quite important to get experience in a job
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 10.50 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well as it stands what is facing us is a chart which draw a switch or a picture of three new online pop music sites
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 10.50 17.53 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as we can see there is a comparation between different thousand thousand of peoples and different days
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 17.53 24.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it's paramount to draw special attention to the fact that tunes net began to hit rock bottom
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 24.46 31.43 <o,Q5,B2,P4> however it's going up right now and it's (%hesitation%) at the most senior level
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 31.43 43.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> however if we speak about (%hesitation%) music now and songs four you (%hesitation%) they were at the upside of the present leader
SI1267-01177-P40018 1 SI1267-01177 43.88 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> however but it continues to drop and by the same token (%hesitation%) they are now in the (%hesitation%) worst level for example
SI1267-01177-P50019 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 4.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is something that is on everyone's list
SI1267-01177-P50019 1 SI1267-01177 4.64 12.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if i have to say something i would say that a person who understand everyone and support their team
SI1267-01177-P50019 1 SI1267-01177 12.52 18.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you know not is a person who want to show off or something like that
SI1267-01177-P50019 1 SI1267-01177 18.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> someone who works as a team
SI1267-01177-P50020 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 11.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well that's a difficult question to answer because as you know when you are in a small team (%hesitation%) there are different people and maybe the communication is something good
SI1267-01177-P50020 1 SI1267-01177 11.57 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but at the same time many people want to do the same thing or there are problems when it comes to
SI1267-01177-P50021 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 2.40 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes sure why not
SI1267-01177-P50021 1 SI1267-01177 2.40 9.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i should i should say that if it is always in a (poli-) polite way
SI1267-01177-P50021 1 SI1267-01177 9.28 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example it's nothing bad if you disagree on someone because for example this that mean that you are thinking about how to improve (%hesitation%) your team
SI1267-01177-P50022 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 6.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't agree with this question but i would say that i prefer to work face to face
SI1267-01177-P50022 1 SI1267-01177 6.70 18.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we we live in a world that it is that is very competitive and we have technology as an a tool for these type of teams to work as a teams but i prefer to work face to face
SI1267-01177-P50022 1 SI1267-01177 18.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's more effective
SI1267-01177-P50023 1 SI1267-01177 0.00 12.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it's difficult to answer this question because i should give a special attention to the fact that it depends on the person you are or the people who integrate your team
SI1267-01177-P50023 1 SI1267-01177 12.33 17.40 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you are working with people who are super lazy obviously is better to work alone
SI1267-01177-P50023 1 SI1267-01177 17.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if your friends on your team work
SI1267-01186-P10005 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 10.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> actually i do consider myself an environmentalist because i care about the sustainability develops of cities
SI1267-01186-P10005 1 SI1267-01186 10.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) for example i pay a lot attention on how much plastic do i use during the day and not having (enou-)
SI1267-01186-P10006 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 19.76 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to say we love we love enjoy time together reading for example but the truth is we enjoy hanging out going to bars having drinks and maybe stay in at night at home seeing watching movies
SI1267-01186-P10006 1 SI1267-01186 19.76 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and
SI1267-01186-P10007 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 11.53 <o,Q4,B2,P1> probably the people (%hesitation%) who i get along the most is my mom because she and i have a lot of things in common
SI1267-01186-P10007 1 SI1267-01186 11.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we two enjoy having our time together watching movies or tv show hanging around (%hesitation%)
SI1267-01186-P10008 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 4.22 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't have problems actually living here or there
SI1267-01186-P10008 1 SI1267-01186 4.22 9.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) now i'm living in a malaga which is a city located by the sea
SI1267-01186-P10008 1 SI1267-01186 9.91 15.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would love to live here because of the weather
SI1267-01186-P10008 1 SI1267-01186 15.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> there is not cold and not even so (%hesitation%) hot in
SI1267-01186-P30017 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 23.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i do consider one of the advantages of giving free time to students to for doing fitness fitness classes will have (%hesitation%) help (%hesitation%) students to (lo-) lose (%hesitation%) their anxiety and lower their levels of stress
SI1267-01186-P30017 1 SI1267-01186 23.40 41.09 <o,Q4,B2,P3> otherwise (%hesitation%) one of the disadvantages in my opinion is that there's there are no more options to fulfil that free time unless giving them the chance to take fitness classes
SI1267-01186-P30017 1 SI1267-01186 41.09 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> what happened then to the student which are no interested in fitness will (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%)
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 16.13 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as most people know (%hesitation%) the honey it's made by bees (%hesitation%) while they are collect (%hesitation%) them (%hesitation%) the nectar from the flowers
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 16.13 24.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) after collecting them (%hesitation%) the bees go to the beehives where they produce the the honey
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 24.50 36.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that (%hesitation%) there are some workers which are specialise on collecting (%hesitation%) honey from these beehives
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 36.30 42.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> all the honey collected are put in some jars
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 42.21 47.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they are to deliver to the supermarkets
SI1267-01186-P40018 1 SI1267-01186 47.21 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> there actually are different kinds of honey (%hesitation%) coming from different types of of species of bees in nature
SI1267-01186-P50019 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 6.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) students actually (%hesitation%) consider many things as they choose some country for live in
SI1267-01186-P50019 1 SI1267-01186 6.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one of them is the price of the living the culture they like the difficulty of the language of the place there go and if the weather place them to live there for
SI1267-01186-P50020 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> studying a second language has a lot of advantages and one of them it's letting people to travel and known a different kind of culture and make them independent to live in in another place and grow as a person
SI1267-01186-P50021 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 10.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) living in another country and learning and studying there it's something that only students that are privileged can do that
SI1267-01186-P50021 1 SI1267-01186 10.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it all depend on the budget that it's the most difficult things to face and getting grants that help them live there
SI1267-01186-P50022 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the best way of learning a local culture it's having a lot of friends from that local (%hesitation%) country (%hesitation%) visiting places going to museums watching movies from that special place and eating food from the (re-)
SI1267-01186-P50023 1 SI1267-01186 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think this is is true because as they live by their owns alone in a flat or sharing an apartment they have to wash the dishes (%hesitation%) clean their clothes make their own food and finding the way to live by
SI1267-01188-P10005 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 8.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> about the place where i live i can tell you that it's a comfortable city not big not small
SI1267-01188-P10005 1 SI1267-01188 8.75 13.07 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) you have plenty of things to do
SI1267-01188-P10005 1 SI1267-01188 13.07 18.20 <o,Q5,B2,P1> everything is near (%hesitation%) so that you don't have to do big trips big travels
SI1267-01188-P10005 1 SI1267-01188 18.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think it's a very comfortable
SI1267-01188-P10006 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 11.56 <o,Q5,B2,P1> while i'm on holiday i enjoy trying new things (%hesitation%) new places (%hesitation%) new food obviously if i'm (%hesitation%) visiting a country abroad
SI1267-01188-P10006 1 SI1267-01188 11.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) but if i can enjoy it with friends and good company (%hesitation%) that would be the key for me (%hesitation%) if i'm doing my holidays
SI1267-01188-P10007 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 4.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i (sp-) (%hesitation%) i spend time with everyone
SI1267-01188-P10007 1 SI1267-01188 4.15 7.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending time with with every single member of my family
SI1267-01188-P10007 1 SI1267-01188 7.75 18.06 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) but i (th-) think i have to say that my when i spend time with my sister i really enjoy it just because i don't have that much time to spend with her usually
SI1267-01188-P10007 1 SI1267-01188 18.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so yeah i i really enjoy it
SI1267-01188-P10008 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 1.69 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i don't know yet
SI1267-01188-P10008 1 SI1267-01188 1.69 8.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's too early for me (%hesitation%) to know where i want to be in the future where i want to work at
SI1267-01188-P10008 1 SI1267-01188 8.98 11.87 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) so i have to think of it
SI1267-01188-P10008 1 SI1267-01188 11.87 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think (%hesitation%) as long as i have a comfortable job with good people around me that would be a good place to work
SI1267-01188-P30017 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 22.47 <o,Q5,B2,P3> talking about the advantages and disadvantages of students (%hesitation%) getting jobs to pay their university studies i should say that as advantages (%hesitation%) those would be for example they would gain experience (%hesitation%) and they will learn values such as hard work and discipline in order to accomplish something
SI1267-01188-P30017 1 SI1267-01188 22.47 39.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in talking about on the other hand on on disadvantages i think that at those ages they should focus on studying and just be focused on what they want to be and to become what they want to be (%hesitation%) in the future
SI1267-01188-P30017 1 SI1267-01188 39.86 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion i don't think that students should get jobs in order to pay universities because they should be free for for for me or or have a (%hesitation%) less cost and being everyone (%hesitation%) capable of getting to university
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in order to travel by plane you have to follow (%hesitation%) several steps (%hesitation%) until you finally get into the plane
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 11.12 14.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all (%hesitation%) you have to travel to the airport
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 14.24 20.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i recommend you to travel by an hour and a half or two hours before (%hesitation%) you have the travel
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 20.34 33.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) secondly (%hesitation%) is very important to do the check in once you get to the airport (%hesitation%) before you pass several controls such as (%hesitation%) document control or security control
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 33.96 44.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) once you've completed all these stages which are very important in the whole process you will have your time (%hesitation%) to wait until (%hesitation%) boarding
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 44.81 48.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 48.82 55.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so after all those steps you just have to board into the plane and enjoy your trip
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 55.12 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so i would i say i would say those are the the main steps
SI1267-01188-P50019 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 17.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think students can use technology (%hesitation%) for using other platforms or other options rather than books (%hesitation%) to study (%hesitation%) and being connected with people to share knowledge and and and notes
SI1267-01188-P50019 1 SI1267-01188 17.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think that's very helpful
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 7.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think obviously is a better option to learn (w-) face to face with a professor or a teacher
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188 7.59 12.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you get a different perspective
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188 12.38 15.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's more direct direct form
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188 15.08 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) so yeah i think it's better in so many ways
SI1267-01188-P50021 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 12.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the most (%hesitation%) important skill that a a student can learn from group projects are (%hesitation%) to hear people listen to people and learn from it
SI1267-01188-P50021 1 SI1267-01188 12.89 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) obviously another ones are sharing thoughts (%hesitation%) and respect from your teammates
SI1267-01188-P50022 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 3.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> of course is more useful attending lectures
SI1267-01188-P50022 1 SI1267-01188 3.52 12.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you listen to a professional as your teacher and you have the option of listening doubts from other students
SI1267-01188-P50022 1 SI1267-01188 12.98 14.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you interact with them
SI1267-01188-P50022 1 SI1267-01188 14.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think you have (%hesitation%) more benefits (%hesitation%) with this with this option attending (lec-)
SI1267-01188-P50023 1 SI1267-01188 0.00 9.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's so important to have good facilities (%hesitation%) such as a library (%hesitation%) a good good places for studying for students
SI1267-01188-P50023 1 SI1267-01188 9.57 12.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) they get more involved in the university
SI1267-01188-P50023 1 SI1267-01188 12.51 17.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they experience (%hesitation%) the the university in another different way
SI1267-01188-P50023 1 SI1267-01188 17.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's (%hesitation%) essential to have good
SI1267-01291-P10005 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 4.98 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interested in environment
SI1267-01291-P10005 1 SI1267-01291 4.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually recycle all kinds of products at home in order to get a better world in the future
SI1267-01291-P10006 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 9.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well years ago when i was younger we used to play football all together
SI1267-01291-P10006 1 SI1267-01291 9.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but in these days we tend to go for a run
SI1267-01291-P10007 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 13.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am extremely similar to my mother not only physically but the personality as well
SI1267-01291-P10007 1 SI1267-01291 13.05 17.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i can understand my mother
SI1267-01291-P10007 1 SI1267-01291 17.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> every day
SI1267-01291-P10008 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 2.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i really don't mind
SI1267-01291-P10008 1 SI1267-01291 2.73 5.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i just want to be happy
SI1267-01291-P10008 1 SI1267-01291 5.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) the place where i am going to live is not important for me but i guess that i would prefer living in spain my country
SI1267-01291-P30017 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 12.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> students are usually fat in these days not only in spain but around the whole world
SI1267-01291-P30017 1 SI1267-01291 12.13 28.99 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think it's essential to the schools to make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI1267-01291-P30017 1 SI1267-01291 28.99 34.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i can only see advantages in that way
SI1267-01291-P30017 1 SI1267-01291 34.62 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> maybe one of the disadvantage is the smell after doing fitness classes because there are not showers in the spanish schools so it can be a problem
SI1267-01291-P40018 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 8.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> everybody likes honey but where is it come from
SI1267-01291-P40018 1 SI1267-01291 8.71 20.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well first of all the animal called bee is collecting nectar from flowers
SI1267-01291-P40018 1 SI1267-01291 20.38 30.01 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI1267-01291-P40018 1 SI1267-01291 30.01 50.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the human being the professional has to collect honey from beehives in the more natural way as possible
SI1267-01291-P40018 1 SI1267-01291 50.78 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that honey is almost ready to be eaten
SI1267-01291-P50019 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that for example a spaniard should consider that nobody talks in spanish in that country because that is the best way in order to learn
SI1267-01291-P50020 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 14.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that more knowledge you have or skills you have then (%hesitation%) more (%hesitation%) easily (%hesitation%) you will get a job in the future
SI1267-01291-P50020 1 SI1267-01291 14.97 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's crucial to study in a second language
SI1267-01291-P50021 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 8.01 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my humble opinion it won't be easy in the beginning
SI1267-01291-P50021 1 SI1267-01291 8.01 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in the end that choice of studying in another country will be great
SI1267-01291-P50022 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 14.33 <o,Q4,B2,P5> speaking from my own experience (%hesitation%) i learnt a lot of (%hesitation%) local culture when i was studying in england
SI1267-01291-P50022 1 SI1267-01291 14.33 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i met lovely people that i am
SI1267-01291-P50023 1 SI1267-01291 0.00 4.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i couldn't agree more with that
SI1267-01291-P50023 1 SI1267-01291 4.17 15.74 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) studying abroad is essential in order to become independent
SI1267-01291-P50023 1 SI1267-01291 15.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> everybody should study
SI127E-00028-P10005 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 11.40 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy learning about other countries (%hesitation%) specially about (%hesitation%) its culture its language its history
SI127E-00028-P10005 1 SI127E-00028 11.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it's quite interesting for me
SI127E-00028-P10006 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 6.37 <o,Q5,B1,P1> on my leisure time i like (%hesitation%) to do yoga or to tailor
SI127E-00028-P10006 1 SI127E-00028 6.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i am fascinated in fashion and tailoring
SI127E-00028-P10007 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 9.75 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i guess there are a lot of way to improve (%hesitation%) my english (%hesitation%)
SI127E-00028-P10007 1 SI127E-00028 9.75 18.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for example i am studying all on speak and improve and on write and improve
SI127E-00028-P10007 1 SI127E-00028 18.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i also listen for (pod-)
SI127E-00028-P10008 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 6.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> honestly i'm not very good in establishing a rapport with other people
SI127E-00028-P10008 1 SI127E-00028 6.94 13.29 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm an introvert and i'd like to be more extrovert show
SI127E-00028-P10008 1 SI127E-00028 13.29 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i'd like (%hesitation%) to have such a skill as small talk
SI127E-00028-P30017 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that working part time while studying (%hesitation%) helps us (%hesitation%) to be more organised (%hesitation%) to be more autonomous
SI127E-00028-P30017 1 SI127E-00028 14.61 25.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and it also (%hesitation%) helps us (%hesitation%) to practice (%hesitation%) in what are we studying
SI127E-00028-P30017 1 SI127E-00028 25.59 43.95 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i mean that (%hesitation%) we have an opportunity (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) to experience what are we studying and do something (%hesitation%) what we studied about
SI127E-00028-P30017 1 SI127E-00028 43.95 58.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and as for disadvantages i think that of course it takes time and (%hesitation%) you have less time for studying and for your (%hesitation%) assignments from university
SI127E-00028-P30017 1 SI127E-00028 58.77 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and it's
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 14.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> now i'd like to tell you about acid rain about its reasons (%hesitation%) about process of its formation and about consequences of acid rain
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 14.62 26.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all (%hesitation%) a lot of factories on our planet (%hesitation%) makes a lot of pollutions
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 26.26 35.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then these pollutions are with the smoke raised to the air
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 35.82 49.28 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and wind the wind it fly to clouds and it (%hesitation%) compound with clouds
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 49.28 57.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then it (%hesitation%) fall with rain or snow (%hesitation%) into our forests and lawns
SI127E-00028-P40018 1 SI127E-00028 57.97 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and it makes damage to
SI127E-00028-P50019 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it's a tricky question but first of all eat less ready made meal and eat more home prepared meal and no fast food and junk food
SI127E-00028-P50020 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 15.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i heard that everybody should drink enough water (%hesitation%) and i heard (%hesitation%) the good amount is about two or three liters of water
SI127E-00028-P50020 1 SI127E-00028 15.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but as for me i can't drink so much water
SI127E-00028-P50021 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> as for my opinion i think that it's of vital importance to do exercise every morning or every evening if you want to have (%hesitation%) a healthy lifestyle
SI127E-00028-P50022 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm not sure about eight hours of sleeping but (%hesitation%) i can agree that it's very important to have enough sleeping
SI127E-00028-P50022 1 SI127E-00028 12.18 18.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for some people it can be (%hesitation%) just six or seven hours
SI127E-00028-P50022 1 SI127E-00028 18.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and for some people
SI127E-00028-P50023 1 SI127E-00028 0.00 18.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it have both positive and negative effects and you should remember about digital (%hesitation%) hygienic and (%hesitation%) you should spend less times with your gadgets
SI127E-00028-P50023 1 SI127E-00028 18.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they are made for your
SI127E-00085-P10005 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to travel a lot and (%hesitation%) know different culture
SI127E-00085-P10006 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoying that by reading many books (%hesitation%) especially in (%hesitation%) (artis-)
SI127E-00085-P10007 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am trying (%hesitation%) to attend (%hesitation%) courses (%hesitation%) online and reading (%hesitation%) many english books
SI127E-00085-P10008 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it will be how to play tennis
SI127E-00085-P30017 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.52 <o,Q4,B2,P3> from my opinion (%hesitation%) it's good for a university student to do part time because it (%hesitation%) gets (%hesitation%) many advantage to them (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) acquire new experience (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) make (%hesitation%) a new friends
SI127E-00085-P30017 1 SI127E-00085 20.52 32.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-00085-P30017 1 SI127E-00085 32.08 36.10 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) spend (%hesitation%) their time (%hesitation%) in a good

SI127E-00085-P30017 1 SI127E-00085 51.03 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) another advantage is that they learn how to be independent person
SI127E-00085-P40018 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 15.79 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the acid rain happened when the smoke from factory (%hesitation%) came up until reach (%hesitation%) the sky
SI127E-00085-P40018 1 SI127E-00085 15.79 28.41 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the wind carried this smoke (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) integrate it with the dust
SI127E-00085-P40018 1 SI127E-00085 28.41 35.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then other acid (%hesitation%) particles mix with cloud water
SI127E-00085-P40018 1 SI127E-00085 35.91 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that acid particles are are in the rain or snow
SI127E-00085-P50019 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.28 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for eating the habits (%hesitation%) it's preferable to eat three times per day and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) must be healthy food including vegetables meat and low carbohydrate
SI127E-00085-P50020 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 14.58 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) drinking a lot of water (%hesitation%) to keep (%hesitation%) body hydration and allow you to (%hesitation%) feel (%hesitation%) fresh (%hesitation%) every moment
SI127E-00085-P50020 1 SI127E-00085 14.58 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's (%hesitation%) recommended to drink (%hesitation%) around two bottles of
SI127E-00085-P50021 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is not essential to do exercise every day but at least three times (%hesitation%) per week and (%hesitation%) the duration for each one must (%hesitation%) be an hour
SI127E-00085-P50022 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> sleeping is very important and eight hours is (%hesitation%) ok because most of researches (%hesitation%) and reviews (%hesitation%) tell us (%hesitation%) you have to sleep at least eight hours per day
SI127E-00085-P50023 1 SI127E-00085 0.00 5.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> technology have a positive and a negative effective
SI127E-00085-P50023 1 SI127E-00085 5.34 8.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> both sides are available
SI127E-00085-P50023 1 SI127E-00085 8.18 17.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for positive effective (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it allows them to read (%hesitation%) a lot of books through internet
SI127E-00085-P50023 1 SI127E-00085 17.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) you don't need to
SI127E-00160-P10005 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'd like to learn about other countries and their cultures because its open a new window a new vision to me
SI127E-00160-P10006 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like to i like to (%hesitation%) listen to music watch movies (%hesitation%) design (%hesitation%) user interface or (wa-) or just walking
SI127E-00160-P10007 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is to (%hesitation%) speak with someone (%hesitation%) like a native speaker or someone (%hesitation%) has skill enough (%hesitation%) to talk me back
SI127E-00160-P10008 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> definitely it's (%hesitation%) programming or web development
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> working for students (%hesitation%) have some advantages and disadvantages
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 7.41 22.59 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some of (%hesitation%) its (%hesitation%) advantages is the work give them (%hesitation%) experience in some field and also it makes (%hesitation%) them ready to work in future
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 22.59 31.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also it's (%hesitation%) teach them to how to behave and treat a client or anybody
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 31.23 37.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) all but it has (%hesitation%) however it has some disadvantages
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 37.50 45.89 <o,Q4,B2,P3> maybe its effect on study because it makes them tired and there is no energy to study
SI127E-00160-P30017 1 SI127E-00160 45.89 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and finally my suggestion is that the university must must have some jobs for a student in a relative field that they study
SI127E-00160-P40018 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 15.83 <o,Q5,B2,P4> there are lots of reason that make acid rain but a majority of that come from (%hesitation%) factories' smoke and also vehicles' pollution
SI127E-00160-P40018 1 SI127E-00160 15.83 35.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) first of first pollution from factors and vehicles come to the air and acid particles combined in a cloud or some of them fall as a dust
SI127E-00160-P40018 1 SI127E-00160 35.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after a while (%hesitation%) cloud making a cloud make (%hesitation%) rain and acid particles are in rain or snow falling to the trees and ground
SI127E-00160-P50019 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 7.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think they have to eat each meals in that specific time
SI127E-00160-P50019 1 SI127E-00160 7.28 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also they have to (pre-) prevent (%hesitation%) to eating junk foods and eating healthy food instead of that
SI127E-00160-P50020 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 9.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> human have to drink at least eight glass of water every day
SI127E-00160-P50020 1 SI127E-00160 9.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think (%hesitation%) they have to split them in a day and drink it in that
SI127E-00160-P50021 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes of course because (%hesitation%) with the progress of technology people (%hesitation%) own (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) people settle very very lot and have to doing exercise for healthy of them
SI127E-00160-P50022 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (i-) that's right because if (%hesitation%) your body can't rest and (%hesitation%) working (%hesitation%) hour and hour it makes it tired and exhausted for next day
SI127E-00160-P50023 1 SI127E-00160 0.00 8.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there is no culture (%hesitation%) that how to use a device or (te-) new technology

SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 0.00 6.03 <o,Q4,C,P3> working during university years can cut both ways
SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 6.03 12.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> many students have the advantage to earn extra money for their personal stuffs

SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 18.45 26.11 <o,Q4,C,P3> what they have to concentrate in their study course as a first thing to achieve
SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 26.11 35.89 <o,Q4,C,P3> unfortunately some students quit the your their university after start working and earn money
SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 35.89 46.78 <o,Q4,C,P3> for other students is impossible to work and study and the same time because of the time consuming for both tasks
SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 46.78 52.70 <o,Q4,C,P3> i believe that is very personal to each student and his circumstances
SI127E-00250-P30017 1 SI127E-00250 52.70 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> work and study is the ideal way but so many no many students can accomplish it
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 0.00 4.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i will give you a short brief about the formation of acid rain
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 4.97 17.29 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all as you can see in the diagram the smoke that is expelled from the lot of vehicles and also from huge companies contaminate the air we breathe
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 17.29 25.29 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this pollution in form of smoke contain acid particles that are traveled by the wind
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 25.29 36.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some of these acid particles return to the soil as dust but other acid particles is mixed with the water in the clouds
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 36.26 44.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as a result these acid particles return to the earth in the rain or the snow
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 44.89 54.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this acid rain damage the environment including soil air water animals human and trees

SI127E-00425-P30017 1 SI127E-00425 0.00 8.32 <o,Q5,B2,P3> nowadays there are all student university students do part time job while they studying

SI127E-00425-P30017 1 SI127E-00425 26.90 36.75 <o,Q5,B2,P3> as you know many student they spend a lot of time doing part time job so they they can't finished their courses
SI127E-00425-P30017 1 SI127E-00425 36.75 44.25 <o,Q5,B2,P3> many of them failed and so it's very bad for their future when they can't get degree
SI127E-00425-P30017 1 SI127E-00425 44.25 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion students should balance between working doing part time job and studying because study is more important and they need to spend more time for their studying

SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 18.63 29.33 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i believe a disadvantage will be you know managing the time between the studies and the the time for work
SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 29.33 31.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> that could be a problem
SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 31.45 36.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but at the same time that could be a lesson as well
SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 36.91 37.94 <o,Q5,C,P3> you can learn from it
SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 37.94 50.42 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my opinion i think it's always a positive experience to get a job during the the university (%hesitation%) time
SI127E-00438-P30017 1 SI127E-00438 50.42 54.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> you can always learn something about it

SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 7.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) in first place to travel by airplane you need to get to an airport
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 7.22 11.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can get there by car by bus or you can take the train
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 11.63 17.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> airplanes get permission to take off and landing by the control tower
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 17.58 26.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> once you're at the airport you have to look for the check in to check your tickets and to drop off your luggage
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 26.09 29.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> from there you go to document control
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 29.09 35.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> they will check your passport and then you'll have security that will check your hand luggage
SI127E-00438-P40018 1 SI127E-00438 35.75 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you can sit and wait to be called for boarding
SI127E-00438-P50019 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 6.64 <o,Q5,C,P5> well they can use technology through computers computers and internet
SI127E-00438-P50019 1 SI127E-00438 6.64 10.08 <o,Q5,C,P5> they can research everything they want online
SI127E-00438-P50019 1 SI127E-00438 10.08 14.70 <o,Q5,C,P5> and they can use the computer to write everything
SI127E-00438-P50019 1 SI127E-00438 14.70 16.35 <o,Q5,C,P5> they have documents

SI127E-00438-P50020 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 4.05 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think nowadays that's been proven wrong
SI127E-00438-P50020 1 SI127E-00438 4.05 14.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> we have a situation that we really understand now that if we do courses online they are as good as doing face to face
SI127E-00438-P50020 1 SI127E-00438 14.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> face to face is good but online is also possible
SI127E-00438-P50021 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 4.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> well they can learn how to listen to each other

SI127E-00438-P50022 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 1.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it is
SI127E-00438-P50022 1 SI127E-00438 1.84 12.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think when you see someone talking about a subject is more effective because you pay more attention than reading
SI127E-00438-P50022 1 SI127E-00438 12.41 14.58 <o,Q5,C,P5> you with reading you can go back
SI127E-00438-P50022 1 SI127E-00438 14.58 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but when you go (%hesitation%) and go somewhere to listen to someone
SI127E-00438-P50023 1 SI127E-00438 0.00 2.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> it is very important
SI127E-00438-P50023 1 SI127E-00438 2.13 10.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> nowadays students are used to a lot of technology and a lot of apps that do everything for them
SI127E-00438-P50023 1 SI127E-00438 10.13 18.64 <o,Q5,C,P5> so if universities or schools don't have what they have home they will feel very disappointed
SI127E-00438-P50023 1 SI127E-00438 18.64 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and they don't feel (chal-)
SI127E-00444-P10005 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 3.72 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm not interesting too much
SI127E-00444-P10005 1 SI127E-00444 3.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think that is quite important because i (d-) we don't have other planet to live and the people hasn't be aware about the important of environment i think
SI127E-00444-P10006 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well before the situation of covid nineteen we like to (le-) we liked to play football but after this situation we like to play video games and read books
SI127E-00444-P10007 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that is my mother because i have the same personality that he has and maybe my friends say me that i have the same self appearance that he has

SI127E-00444-P10008 1 SI127E-00444 19.83 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so
SI127E-00444-P30017 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 23.62 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well i think that one of the advantages is that the fact that the students has to do an exercise to be healthy and so it's so important
SI127E-00444-P30017 1 SI127E-00444 23.62 27.62 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that it is so important
SI127E-00444-P30017 1 SI127E-00444 27.62 33.38 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and one of the disadvantages i think that there is no one
SI127E-00444-P30017 1 SI127E-00444 33.38 40.41 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think you have to do your workout and be healthy
SI127E-00444-P30017 1 SI127E-00444 40.41 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that this is quite important because the student needs (%hesitation%) forty five minutes per day for physically
SI127E-00444-P40018 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 14.88 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well the picture shows a diagram of how the bees collect nectar nectar from the flowers

SI127E-00444-P40018 1 SI127E-00444 53.64 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and that's it
SI127E-00444-P50019 1 SI127E-00444 0.00 8.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the price of the thing that they will be buy like a lot of food

SI127E-00510-P10008 1 SI127E-00510 15.27 20.04 <o,Q4,C,P1> so for me it would be (%hesitation%) vital for my life
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 20.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> well (%hesitation%) it's a good thing that students (%hesitation%) do a part time job while they are a student because the benefits it's that they can save money (%hesitation%) for their expenses such as food clothes (%hesitation%) travellings the tickets for commuting and (%hesitation%) so on
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 20.91 37.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand there are (%hesitation%) re (%hesitation%) drawbacks too because (%hesitation%) it's a huge time consuming to dedicate and contrating and concentrate into studying and do projects in groups and presentations and all these things
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 37.15 45.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in conclusion from my point of view it's a good a perfect method (t-) to start to be financially independent from your parents
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 45.28 55.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> as well as (%hesitation%) you have the chance to organise your time (%hesitation%) to combined (%hesitation%) work and studying
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 55.30 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it's a good way to become independent and mature
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 7.15 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it is obvious that we must to end with the pollution in our cities
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 7.15 14.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is because they're we they they are producing acid rain
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 14.95 26.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) this is (%hesitation%) is produced is caused (%hesitation%) with the acid (%hesitation%) particles in smoke which is carried by the wind
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 26.89 38.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some acid particles fall far fall as dust and others with the clouds' water
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 38.44 55.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> that provokes that acid particle (%hesitation%) fall down in the ground and that affect to the growing of the greeny greenery and that affects to the (%hesitation%) human population as well
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 55.67 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we can avoid that (%hesitation%) using less
SI127E-00510-P50019 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 17.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> well one of the advices would be (%hesitation%) starting eating (%hesitation%) fruits and vegetable as much as possible and avoid (%hesitation%) having (%hesitation%) products with (lo-) with a lot of high amount of sugar
SI127E-00510-P50019 1 SI127E-00510 17.38 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> that is the main point
SI127E-00510-P50020 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 18.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> well it's step it's important in the sense that we need to be hydrate and that's why it's (%hesitation%) advisable to drink two liters minimum (%hesitation%) of water because our organs need to be in function
SI127E-00510-P50020 1 SI127E-00510 18.94 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> and that's why
SI127E-00510-P50021 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 8.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes at least thirty minute walking can work for you have a better (%hesitation%) a better life
SI127E-00510-P50021 1 SI127E-00510 8.95 16.48 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can (%hesitation%) improve moving your muscles (%hesitation%) so it can be decreasing
SI127E-00510-P50021 1 SI127E-00510 16.48 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's important (%hesitation%) having a good
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 2.42 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes i think it's (%hesitation%) true
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510 2.42 7.67 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) almost the most as you as you need
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510 7.67 17.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> because it's a it's a moment where the the body (%hesitation%) recover from any illnesses or damaging that they have had during the day
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510 17.94 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's quite important
SI127E-00510-P50023 1 SI127E-00510 0.00 18.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> depending on the device because if you have a (%hesitation%) if you have heart attacks (%hesitation%) there are devices that detect that (%hesitation%) that problem easily (%hesitation%) so in that (%hesitation%) in medical (%hesitation%) devices there have improved a lot
SI127E-00510-P50023 1 SI127E-00510 18.47 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's very important too
SI127E-00544-P10005 1 SI127E-00544 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> my town is small but it has bridge river lake and mountain

SI127E-00544-P30017 1 SI127E-00544 0.00 13.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the advantage is (%hesitation%) the students lack (%hesitation%) the money to enjoy it and they have to make a living gain more freedom and autonomy
SI127E-00544-P30017 1 SI127E-00544 13.31 23.72 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the disadvantage they having less time to study less time (%hesitation%) social time or to take a break

SI127E-00544-P50019 1 SI127E-00544 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> they can use their p c for study (%hesitation%) to take notes or to search on internet
SI127E-00544-P50020 1 SI127E-00544 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> they (%hesitation%) i don't like to study face to face because i am shy
SI127E-00544-P50021 1 SI127E-00544 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> they can develop they patience and they learn how to treat with other people

SI127E-00561-P10005 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 2.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) i have to admit that i am interested in the environment
SI127E-00561-P10005 1 SI127E-00561 2.64 4.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm not really really really interested
SI127E-00561-P10005 1 SI127E-00561 4.64 6.07 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm not really keen on environment
SI127E-00561-P10005 1 SI127E-00561 6.07 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> but anyway i tried to read as many articles as possible every day on the news sites to be informed because i think this is a important matter in our our current lives
SI127E-00561-P10006 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 16.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> we enjoy doing together different things but one of the things that we do most probably is to go out for a beer and not a couple of beer just to have yeah interesting or or normal conversation about (%hesitation%) something serious thing
SI127E-00561-P10006 1 SI127E-00561 16.30 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> but on the other hand we try to to say
SI127E-00561-P10007 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 10.39 <o,Q4,C,P1> this is a tough a controversial question to answer so (diffi-) but i'd say that i'm similar to my mum because we are both like sensible person
SI127E-00561-P10007 1 SI127E-00561 10.39 13.36 <o,Q4,C,P1> we act like (%hesitation%) lovely person the same
SI127E-00561-P10007 1 SI127E-00561 13.36 18.80 <o,Q4,C,P1> but on the other hand a little sometime we can get a little bit pessimistic about something
SI127E-00561-P10007 1 SI127E-00561 18.80 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so i would say that i am most
SI127E-00561-P10008 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 5.55 <o,Q5,C,P1> i haven't given much thought on that
SI127E-00561-P10008 1 SI127E-00561 5.55 13.89 <o,Q5,C,P1> but i'd say that in the future i would like i i see myself in the some some country in the south america
SI127E-00561-P10008 1 SI127E-00561 13.89 18.45 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i'd like to live in argentina at least for a for a few years

SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 3.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think this is a good topic to talk about
SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 3.31 16.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> yeah thinking about advantages i think one of the main advantages is that (%hesitation%) if we permit our students to do fitness class yeah this is going to help them to develop a healthy lifestyle in the future
SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 16.98 32.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> about the disan disadvantages i say one of the the main disadvantages would be that they probably would have less time to work on other subjects so we have to take that into consideration
SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 32.47 47.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> my opinion i think from my per pest from my point of view i'd say that we should all schools should schedule some some fitness lesson some fitness classes (%hesitation%) periodically
SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 47.78 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> probably not every single day but (ju-) just for at least a few days a week three days a week a week to make them develop a good health
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 13.44 <o,Q5,C,P4> okay i'm going to give (%hesitation%) a quick presentation about how how honey yeah goes from flower to shop
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 13.44 21.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think the first the first stage is that the bees collect nectar from flowers and then they will make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 21.22 27.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that beekeeper the men the man who are beekeepers collect happing honey from from beehives
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 27.78 41.34 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that i'd say then they put them into jars and then to collect them and then the the honey is delivered to a truck or a lorry
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 41.34 49.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then they the this this honey end up in the shelves of of the shops
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 49.61 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this is the whole process from flowers then beehives then beekeepers collect honey from beehives then putting put in put them into jars and then (%hesitation%)
SI127E-00561-P50019 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah i think students should consider many aspect many thing for example what language is spoken in that country even the country so far is too far from the origin country because sometime you can you want to to get fly and can be very very expensive
SI127E-00561-P50020 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 5.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) when you study in a second language the main thing the main advantage is that you are going to learn other language
SI127E-00561-P50020 1 SI127E-00561 5.23 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> probably it might well be useful for you in the future for example for for for choosing a new job or or (ha-) having a good grade in interview so you have a good to make a good impression on people when you (ts-)
SI127E-00561-P50021 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 16.41 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah probably one of the things that you might feel this kind of homesick because you are going to miss your family and friends anyway especially if the country that you have chosen (%hesitation%) that you has chosen you have chosen it's a country when you can't speak your language

SI127E-00561-P50022 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 16.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah and i think the most important thing to know about the another another local culture is try to meet as many people as possible and try to communicate with them try to hanging out with them even to look for or or to watch carefully the behaviour of them
SI127E-00561-P50022 1 SI127E-00561 16.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so try to be out as much as possible
SI127E-00561-P50023 1 SI127E-00561 0.00 16.91 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah i totally agree with with the people who think that because i think (%hesitation%) when you when you are alone in other countries and you have to face so many difficulties in every single day so it's going to to help you to become more independent
SI127E-00561-P50023 1 SI127E-00561 16.91 18.20 <o,Q5,C,P5> yeah this is for sure

SI127E-00568-P10005 1 SI127E-00568 5.79 16.91 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it has a lot of culture issues for example the cathedral of seville and the giralda

SI127E-00568-P10008 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 7.11 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well in a future i will be a government person
SI127E-00568-P10008 1 SI127E-00568 7.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i mean i will like to have a government job and help people that need help at least economic help
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well to have a part job at the same time that you are studying (u-) university could be really hard
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 11.07 21.43 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the advantages are that you could save money to spend on a good master when you finished your degree
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 21.43 27.06 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and you know what are your limits
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 27.06 38.60 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantages are that you don't have enough free time to spend with your family or your friend go out go to the cinema or go to the beach
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 38.60 46.09 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion this is really riching because you learn how to organisate yourself
SI127E-00568-P30017 1 SI127E-00568 46.09 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> you need to know how time will you spread studying and how time are you working on your life
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 5.96 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well travel in a plane could be complicated
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 5.96 9.48 <o,Q5,B1,P4> but its is easier than you think
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 9.48 16.33 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first of all you can't forget your passport and your documentation
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 16.33 22.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first you take a car a taxi or a bus to go to the airport
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 22.91 31.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> one time that you are there you will do your check in with a person that will help help you
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 31.06 39.02 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the police check your document and the security
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 39.02 49.33 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you should wait a minute and you could go to the bathroom or take some coffee
SI127E-00568-P40018 1 SI127E-00568 49.33 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you will board and it is all
SI127E-00568-P50019 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 11.24 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well nowadays every company has a new technology and people have to adapt to the globalisation
SI127E-00568-P50019 1 SI127E-00568 11.24 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so this year technology was really important because of covid
SI127E-00568-P50020 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion to have face to face with your teacher is really riching because you could see their corporal language that is really amazing to learn
SI127E-00568-P50021 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 8.57 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well in a future students probably will need to work in groups
SI127E-00568-P50021 1 SI127E-00568 8.57 14.95 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so you will need to be a good teamworking
SI127E-00568-P50021 1 SI127E-00568 14.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion it is a great idea
SI127E-00568-P50022 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 14.58 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i disagree with that because for me the second lectures are more important because you need to learn lonely
SI127E-00568-P50022 1 SI127E-00568 14.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> that is how you will do your exam
SI127E-00568-P50023 1 SI127E-00568 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion this is really really important for public schools and university because if they don't have resources government should provide them
SI127E-00611-P10005 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 5.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> personally i'm very interested in environment because there's no planet b
SI127E-00611-P10005 1 SI127E-00611 5.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we have to take care (%hesitation%) a lot on of this because in the future our sons are going to live in the earth and we have to keep it (%hesitation%) the better we can together
SI127E-00611-P10006 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is travelling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say that i'm very close to my mum because she's the one who spends more time with me and we are also creating a business together
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611 10.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we do really enjoy doing the same things as for example producings this hand made jewellery brand
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 7.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the u s and there i discovered miami
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611 7.59 16.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would say that miami it's my kind of place where always there's good weather and many plans to do
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611 16.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so definitely i would love to live there in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 21.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> when talking about introducing fitness classes at schools i would say that there are more advantages than (it-) disadvantages for it because it is undeniable that getting to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps to be in a better shape and to be healthier in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 21.64 27.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i would say that these are the main advantages
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 27.57 41.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantages it's that they will take (%hesitation%) a lot of time out of the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those (%hesitation%) fitness classes
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 41.29 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my personal opinion it is that it should be optional because not everyone it is going to be able to spend (%hesitation%) that amount of time doing it neither they would like to do it theirselves
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 8.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so today we are going to go through the whole process from how the honey goes from a flower to the shop
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 8.29 15.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so firstly the bees are (%hesitation%) collecting the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 15.45 22.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) they are making that honey nectar in their beehives which there are (%hesitation%) their homes
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 22.82 43.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so once the bee (coll-) collectors are staring at those beehives and see that there's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies that they actually put it into individual (%hesitation%) recipients
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 43.20 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell it to the stores that then we are able to get it from there when we go to the supermarkets
SI127E-00611-P50019 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country where to study abroad (%hesitation%) the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be (%hesitation%) integrated in the (%hesitation%) classroom
SI127E-00611-P50020 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the benefits of studying in a second language (%hesitation%) they are (%hesitation%) very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 5.02 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611 5.02 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture in there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 8.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> when you are abroad you have to really learn the local culture by hanging out with locals
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611 8.46 16.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you just keep hanging out with the international people you are not going to be (%hesitation%) immerse in that
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611 16.39 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
SI127E-00611-P50023 1 SI127E-00611 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad (%hesitation%) it is the first time becoming independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage all your economy your house and all doing the groceries and everything
SI127E-00723-P10005 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 10.20 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm from cadiz but i i live in granada because i studying there
SI127E-00723-P10005 1 SI127E-00723 10.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) granada is a fantastic city but the unique problem is hasn't got beach
SI127E-00723-P10006 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> holiday i (%hesitation%) love to go to the beach go out with my friend go to the party with my friend (%hesitation%) visit my friend from other cities

SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 5.25 <o,Q5,B2,P3> advantages is that you can be more responsible

SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 20.21 24.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantages is time
SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 24.31 31.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) more difficult (%hesitation%) work and study
SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 31.54 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion (%hesitation%) all (%hesitation%) all students (%hesitation%) should work and study at the same time (%hesitation%) in the last year of their degree
SI127E-00723-P40018 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 7.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you travelling by plane the first thing is travel to airport
SI127E-00723-P40018 1 SI127E-00723 7.91 13.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can travel by car by bus (%hesitation%) or by train

SI127E-00723-P40018 1 SI127E-00723 20.51 32.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you have to pass (%hesitation%) in and show your document control and pass the security control
SI127E-00723-P40018 1 SI127E-00723 32.09 42.86 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then after that you can wait (%hesitation%) taking a coffee go to the shopping go to the toilet
SI127E-00723-P40018 1 SI127E-00723 42.86 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) at the time of your plane you board of (%hesitation%) in the plane and then your fly (%hesitation%) start
SI127E-00723-P50019 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 5.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (ogy-) is very important for studying
SI127E-00723-P50019 1 SI127E-00723 5.39 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because for example in internet you can find a lot of information about (%hesitation%) different topics
SI127E-00723-P50020 1 SI127E-00723 0.00 11.72 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master onlines
SI127E-00723-P50020 1 SI127E-00723 11.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i in my opinion i think that's there are a good option to study

SI127E-00774-P50022 1 SI127E-00774 0.00 13.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think that attending to lectures is worse than reading for your own because you are not as focused as if you were who who is reading

SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 41.14 44.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to wait before the boarding time

SI127E-00974-P30017 1 SI127E-00974 11.00 30.03 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example students would gain (%hesitation%) certain practical knowledge about the work how it (%hesitation%) it works (%hesitation%) how to cooperate what the work itself involves what kind of tasks and duties (respons-) responsibilities (%hesitation%) he or she will have to achieve and do every single day
SI127E-00974-P30017 1 SI127E-00974 30.03 37.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i think it would be a good idea for the future employer and for him or her as an employee
SI127E-00974-P30017 1 SI127E-00974 37.74 54.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages yam (%hesitation%) maybe (%hesitation%) if the student knows about the work (%hesitation%) in a more detailed way he (wou-) it would (%hesitation%) hinder him or her to do that kind of (j-) job later
SI127E-00974-P30017 1 SI127E-00974 54.43 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but all in all i would say that it would be a really brilliant idea to be in one of these courses
SI127E-00974-P40018 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 9.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in this chart i can see (%hesitation%) the number of people who are interested in online pop music sites
SI127E-00974-P40018 1 SI127E-00974 9.31 15.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the red line depicts a kind of upward trend
SI127E-00974-P40018 1 SI127E-00974 15.52 22.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as far as those are those listeners are concerned who will listen to tunes net
SI127E-00974-P40018 1 SI127E-00974 22.73 39.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) as far as (%hesitation%) songs four you is concerned we can see a downward tendency because the number of listeners basically have has dropped significantly
SI127E-00974-P40018 1 SI127E-00974 39.09 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and as far as music now site is concerned there is (%hesitation%) a kind of stagnating (%hesitation%) phenomenon (%hesitation%) because basically the number of those people who listen to this channel is basically stagnate
SI127E-00974-P50019 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 2.27 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well this is an interesting question
SI127E-00974-P50019 1 SI127E-00974 2.27 12.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think a good team leader should be ambitious (%hesitation%) should have expertise in the field where he or she works
SI127E-00974-P50019 1 SI127E-00974 12.59 17.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion he should be a good (%hesitation%) collaborative worker
SI127E-00974-P50019 1 SI127E-00974 17.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and he should be able to cooperate with
SI127E-00974-P50020 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 2.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is a brilliant question
SI127E-00974-P50020 1 SI127E-00974 2.16 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> maybe (%hesitation%) the problem can be that (%hesitation%) there is too much workload on each member and they can feel a strenuous after a tiring working day
SI127E-00974-P50020 1 SI127E-00974 12.18 18.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it must be very difficult to (defi-) divide equally the tasks

SI127E-00974-P50021 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 1.40 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think so
SI127E-00974-P50021 1 SI127E-00974 1.40 10.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion (%hesitation%) very good banners should be established in order to be able to work together efficiently
SI127E-00974-P50021 1 SI127E-00974 10.34 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion for that (%hesitation%) collaboration and agreement is highly needed deliberately needed
SI127E-00974-P50022 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 2.05 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is a pretty good question
SI127E-00974-P50022 1 SI127E-00974 2.05 11.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my opinion it can depend on the situation the type of the work the type of the company where the employees are basically employed
SI127E-00974-P50022 1 SI127E-00974 11.54 13.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it depends

SI127E-00974-P50022 1 SI127E-00974 17.22 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it depends on the type of the problem
SI127E-00974-P50023 1 SI127E-00974 0.00 5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in most of the time the situation is (%hesitation%) right

SI127E-00983-P30017 1 SI127E-00983 0.00 26.73 <o,Q5,B1,P3> well to run the question the main advantage for a student who has got a job to pay their studies university or college or something similar is well they gain experience and they earn some money which is useful for them because in general terms a student hasn't got (%hesitation%) a lot of money
SI127E-00983-P30017 1 SI127E-00983 26.73 36.49 <o,Q5,B1,P3> while on the other hand the main disadvantage is the time that he they must spend
SI127E-00983-P30017 1 SI127E-00983 36.49 44.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> spending time for studying is a problem because in general terms they haven't a lot of time

SI127E-00983-P30017 1 SI127E-00983 55.09 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but in my opinion they must or they should
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 0.00 6.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> okay regarding the question you must follow this instruction
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 6.04 16.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first obviously you must travel to airport in a personal car bus train or something similar ok other possibilities
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 16.49 23.67 <o,Q5,B1,P4> at this point in the airport you must check in and the assistant will be useful for you
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 23.67 32.04 <o,Q5,B1,P4> also you must you must speak with security personnel and documenta document control personnel
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 32.04 44.78 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and well in this point after all you must wait it is which is desperating but you will have to do anything anyway
SI127E-00983-P40018 1 SI127E-00983 44.78 53.70 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so finally you can board the plane before the plane take off the ground

SI127E-00983-P50019 1 SI127E-00983 7.34 12.99 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion technology is basic to study at the moment
SI127E-00983-P50019 1 SI127E-00983 12.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> also technology is dangerous and it's a part of distracting for the student

SI127E-01087-P30017 1 SI127E-01087 0.00 8.48 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some of the advantages that you can have by doing a part time job while studying is that you can start earning some money
SI127E-01087-P30017 1 SI127E-01087 8.48 18.20 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and one of the disadvantages it has is that you you can get disconcentrated from doing other things other important things
SI127E-01087-P30017 1 SI127E-01087 18.20 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion is that although you can (%hesitation%) get disconcentrated from school and important things it is a good thing since you are experimenting (%hesitation%) new things in your life
SI127E-01087-P40018 1 SI127E-01087 0.00 12.29 <o,Q4,B1,P4> acid rain is formed when vehicles and factories produce pollution which makes acid particles in the smoke which then are carried by the wind
SI127E-01087-P40018 1 SI127E-01087 12.29 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and some of them fall as dust while others mix with cloud water which then fall in the form of rain or snow damaging the environment causing acid rain
SI127E-01087-P50019 1 SI127E-01087 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> they should think about which nutrients are the best for their body and can maintain them in shape

SI127E-01144-P10007 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> my mother is very similar to me
SI127E-01144-P10008 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 29.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so the this advantage is that all student all students has be in more become improve but the because they are are in the in this society so a lot of students don't move their body
SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144 29.00 47.44 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but disadvantage so if they (ha-) they have a handicap so they can join the class classes so they have (%hesitation%) bad things bad fears
SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144 47.44 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so my opinion is the college make the fitness classes because their health is more improve
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 8.56 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so i will explain how honey to make it how honey how to make honey
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 8.56 14.25 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so the honey the six step to make the honey
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 14.25 16.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so from flower to shop
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 16.59 23.20 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the bees collect the first one bees collect nectar from flower
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 23.20 30.23 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the second step bees make money from nectar in (bee-) beehives beehives
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 30.23 38.48 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the next step beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 38.48 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the honey move to the shop and selling
SI127E-01144-P50019 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when the students choosing the country (%hesitation%) they have to check their their the first language and the culture and the food because they have they have to spend time
SI127E-01144-P50020 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 12.91 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so studying in a second language's advantage is they can talk a lot of people the the another countries
SI127E-01144-P50020 1 SI127E-01144 12.91 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and so they can learn a lot of culture and future
SI127E-01144-P50021 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> student (%hesitation%) studying in a difficult difficult of other in other country so they can get the (cul-) the different culture and the different lifestyle and different food (%hesitation%) so the it is difficult for them
SI127E-01144-P50022 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 6.12 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the two step for the (lang-) local culture
SI127E-01144-P50022 1 SI127E-01144 6.12 14.98 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the first step so they move to another country before they move another country they have to search in the web
SI127E-01144-P50022 1 SI127E-01144 14.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and the second is the they have to learn
SI127E-01144-P50023 1 SI127E-01144 0.00 16.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> they have (s-) (%hesitation%) they're becoming independent in other country because they do (%hesitation%) they have to do themselves for themselves (%hesitation%) cleaning and the cooking or the speaking
SI127E-01144-P50023 1 SI127E-01144 16.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so they can face to face (communicatio-)
SI127E-01191-P10005 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 8.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am fond of interest (%hesitation%) learning around different countries because it is (%hesitation%) significant (%hesitation%) for me
SI127E-01191-P10005 1 SI127E-01191 8.13 13.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it's absolutely interesting for me
SI127E-01191-P10005 1 SI127E-01191 13.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm keen on travelling and i'm fond of learn countries'
SI127E-01191-P10006 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 8.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as i work a lot when i have a free time i try i try and have a rest
SI127E-01191-P10006 1 SI127E-01191 8.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i am fond of outdoor activities such as biking riding bicycles having fun walking
SI127E-01191-P10007 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as for me (%hesitation%) the best way to improve my english is (%hesitation%) speaking constantly writing different essay reading various books and to listening (%hesitation%) various of podcasts
SI127E-01191-P10008 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am fond of interest in different (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) literature and i i like to do various research
SI127E-01191-P30017 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 1.85 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think yes
SI127E-01191-P30017 1 SI127E-01191 1.85 11.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) all university students (%hesitation%) should should do part time jobs because there are a lot of advantages of it
SI127E-01191-P30017 1 SI127E-01191 11.22 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> they can earn their own money and they spend them that only they want
SI127E-01191-P30017 1 SI127E-01191 20.00 45.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> but of course there are disadvantages of it because (%hesitation%) if they don't (%hesitation%) have enough money (t-) for their study so it (%hesitation%) it is not necessary for them (%hesitation%) to do part time jobs because (%hesitation%) they get a very bad marks
SI127E-01191-P30017 1 SI127E-01191 45.02 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think (%hesitation%) students (%hesitation%) must (%hesitation%) sometimes work because it will develop their skills and will help them
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 13.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i think there are a lot of problems connected with factories and vehicles because factories produce a lot of harmful emissions
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 13.24 24.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) also (%hesitation%) all vehicles (%hesitation%) produce (%hesitation%) a lot of carbon dioxide rmissions
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 24.92 31.88 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so in result we get pollution our ecosystem
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 31.88 39.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) so this acid particles are in smoke and we smell this pollution
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 39.52 43.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and acid particles are carried by wind
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 43.31 47.71 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some acid particles will fall as dust
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 47.71 55.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow
SI127E-01191-P40018 1 SI127E-01191 55.27 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we are forced to smell this pollution
SI127E-01191-P50019 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think if person (%hesitation%) wants to (%hesitation%) keep healthy lifestyle (%hesitation%) it is necessary for him (%hesitation%) eat a balanced diet and (%hesitation%) drink enough water doing some exercises and to to get
SI127E-01191-P50020 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 17.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> i i think it is significant for every person to drink enough water during the day because we lose our water balance and we must (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) full ourselves with water
SI127E-01191-P50020 1 SI127E-01191 17.11 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) i think about (fi-)
SI127E-01191-P50021 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 1.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course
SI127E-01191-P50021 1 SI127E-01191 1.47 8.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it is necessary for people to start every day with morning exercises
SI127E-01191-P50021 1 SI127E-01191 8.06 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) it is not necessary to go to gym to do some exercises but it's enough (wa-) to do stretch and exercises

SI127E-01191-P50023 1 SI127E-01191 0.00 3.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> it depends on what side do you look
SI127E-01191-P50023 1 SI127E-01191 3.75 19.52 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course there are advantages of using technologies in our life because (%hesitation%) various of apps related with our health and exercises can help you (%hesitation%) to keep healthy lifestyle
SI127E-01191-P50023 1 SI127E-01191 19.52 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (bu-)

SI127E-01216-P10007 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 11.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that (%hesitation%) my father is the (%hesitation%) (si-) similar most similar person to me or or or the both
SI127E-01216-P10007 1 SI127E-01216 11.62 18.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) we are (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a lot of characteristics in commons and we are patients
SI127E-01216-P10007 1 SI127E-01216 18.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we have

SI127E-01216-P10008 1 SI127E-01216 15.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if i can i would like to to pass the my
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 8.62 <o,Q4,C,P3> so nowaday almost all the college and schools (%hesitation%) dedicate part of her time to fitness classes
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 8.62 15.17 <o,Q4,C,P3> and there is (%hesitation%) their consequence have some advantages and disadvantages
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 15.17 26.32 <o,Q4,C,P3> the first advantage to do fitness (%hesitation%) classes is that the students (%hesitation%) could learn how practice or do some sport in in their house also
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 26.32 39.03 <o,Q4,C,P3> and providing (%hesitation%) or exercising your body (%hesitation%) could improve your mental (%hesitation%) health as well and it's so important
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 39.03 53.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> the disadvantages to doing fitness in classes is that some students could (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) didn't or couldn't (%hesitation%) fall the rules and didn't take (%hesitation%) these classes (%hesitation%) seriously
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 53.56 58.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> and then would be a a waste of time for this kinds of students
SI127E-01216-P30017 1 SI127E-01216 58.23 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion it's a great idea
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 9.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so i gonna talk about an interesting (plo-) process in which bees (%hesitation%) make honey and then (%hesitation%) we we found in the supermarkets
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 9.35 16.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> bees collect nectar from the flowers and it depends at the kind of flower that bees are (%hesitation%) looking the pollen
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 16.97 21.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) could be one or other kind of of (%hesitation%) honey
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 21.83 28.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) there're (%hesitation%) monofloral honey and (%hesitation%) based in multifloral (%hesitation%) components
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 28.99 32.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the bees transport the nectar to (%hesitation%) beehives
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 32.92 37.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) they (st-) store it and the the honey inside
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 37.58 42.11 <o,Q4,B2,P4> is the work of beekeepers to collect honey from the beehives
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 42.11 47.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they have to take some cautions because the the the bees are a danger insects
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 47.72 55.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then (%hesitation%) this bee these honeys are manipulated and putted inside the bottles
SI127E-01216-P40018 1 SI127E-01216 55.86 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) the transport is (%hesitation%) who (%hesitation%) make (%hesitation%)
SI127E-01216-P50019 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the the main reason to travel abroad for studies and choose a (co-) particular country is the the the the the rank or the quality of the university or high school that they will take their
SI127E-01216-P50020 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 12.91 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) i think that learn a second language is very profitable in terms of (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) cultural richness and also to (%hesitation%) earn more money
SI127E-01216-P50020 1 SI127E-01216 12.91 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it's a great skill and could (%hesitation%) open a lot of windows in your work
SI127E-01216-P50021 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 12.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so learn another a new language is a very (%hesitation%) (s-) spend (%hesitation%) time and sometimes (%hesitation%) there are some cultural problems
SI127E-01216-P50021 1 SI127E-01216 12.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think that if you have a good (%hesitation%) attitude you can learn properly and will be a better person
SI127E-01216-P50022 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the easiest way for study (%hesitation%) to know (%hesitation%) the culture of (%hesitation%) her (%hesitation%) the the country abroad is making (%hesitation%) local friends or speaking with natives
SI127E-01216-P50022 1 SI127E-01216 12.18 18.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they are (%hesitation%) who best could (%hesitation%) teach them (%hesitation%) the their culture
SI127E-01216-P50022 1 SI127E-01216 18.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i i think it's a
SI127E-01216-P50023 1 SI127E-01216 0.00 2.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so generally (%hesitation%) it is
SI127E-01216-P50023 1 SI127E-01216 2.54 14.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i am a a student abroad and i have to say that i'm more independent and i learn a lot of things that i couldn't learn if (%hesitation%) if i stay just at home
SI127E-01216-P50023 1 SI127E-01216 14.59 16.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i (%hesitation%) totally agree
SI127E-01216-P50023 1 SI127E-01216 16.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think that you learn a lot outside
SI127E-01246-P10006 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't have many time to (%hesitation%) meet my friends that's why when i meet them we used to hang out and have fun (%hesitation%) have lunch or dinner in a fancy restaurant
SI127E-01246-P10007 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 2.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> definitely my mother
SI127E-01246-P10007 1 SI127E-01246 2.52 4.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like her
SI127E-01246-P10007 1 SI127E-01246 4.69 13.33 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i look like her and my personality is same as her personality
SI127E-01246-P10007 1 SI127E-01246 13.33 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i love her so much
SI127E-01246-P30017 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 21.77 <o,Q5,B1,P3> young people needs to do a lot of exercise so (%hesitation%) there are many benefits in do (%hesitation%) fitness classes at school or college (%hesitation%) because they can grow up (%hesitation%) health and active
SI127E-01246-P30017 1 SI127E-01246 21.77 44.54 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and there are (%hesitation%) some drawbacks we can say because they can hurt herself and sometimes (%hesitation%) maybe they can feel bad
SI127E-01246-P30017 1 SI127E-01246 44.54 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but i think in my opinion that it's very good because they can (%hesitation%) be provided for the future with healthy life
SI127E-01246-P40018 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 7.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the following diagram i'm going to explain how honey is produced
SI127E-01246-P40018 1 SI127E-01246 7.31 27.28 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well firstly bees collect nectar from flowers and transport this this nectar from their beehives where make honey from nectar
SI127E-01246-P40018 1 SI127E-01246 27.28 40.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then beekeepers with an especial equipment to avoid (%hesitation%) bee chopped collect honey from beehives
SI127E-01246-P40018 1 SI127E-01246 40.12 49.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and after that they bottle up their honey
SI127E-01246-P40018 1 SI127E-01246 49.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the last is (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) they transport their honey to the supermarkets (%hesitation%) to be sold
SI127E-01246-P50019 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 9.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i suppose they think about (%hesitation%) choose a country the most convenient country
SI127E-01246-P50019 1 SI127E-01246 9.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i mean (%hesitation%) it will be nearby their country to (%hesitation%) go back frequently
SI127E-01246-P50020 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 13.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you have the chance to (%hesitation%) travel abroad you can communicate with other people if you have a second (%hesitation%) language (%hesitation%) for example english

SI127E-01246-P50021 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 18.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they don't know well their language maybe they can find (%hesitation%) difficult to (%hesitation%) communicate if they if they have to go (%hesitation%) to the doctor or (%hesitation%) do any documents
SI127E-01246-P50021 1 SI127E-01246 18.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it will it will be
SI127E-01246-P50022 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 13.67 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's essential know to know about the local country if you are living abroad because you know well what are the their way to live there
SI127E-01246-P50022 1 SI127E-01246 13.67 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and and you can (%hesitation%) accustom to to this (co-)
SI127E-01246-P50023 1 SI127E-01246 0.00 11.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> of course they become independent and mature and (%hesitation%) more responsible because they have to do by themself
SI127E-01246-P50023 1 SI127E-01246 11.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) the situation helps them to live (%hesitation%) independent without (%hesitation%) the parent
SI127E-01271-P10005 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 3.48 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (m-) so interesting in this point
SI127E-01271-P10005 1 SI127E-01271 3.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i try to help the environment every single day by recycling by go walking instead of use the the car for example

SI127E-01271-P10007 1 SI127E-01271 4.20 7.10 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we think as the same way
SI127E-01271-P10007 1 SI127E-01271 7.10 12.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also people say that i look like her physically
SI127E-01271-P10007 1 SI127E-01271 12.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so yeah i (si-) i look similar to her
SI127E-01271-P10008 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 4.01 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i like many countries including spain
SI127E-01271-P10008 1 SI127E-01271 4.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think that i if i have to choose one i will go to italy because it's a country that i have ever (%hesitation%) seem like it's the best country
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 2.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> while there are many advantages
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 2.93 8.76 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example they can relax if they are so stressed because of studies
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 8.76 25.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i don't consider that's will have (%hesitation%) disadvantages but well if i have to say one i will i will say that (%hesitation%) students can become obsessed with sport
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 25.49 39.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> we know that when they are teenagers (th-) they they don't feel so comfortable with their bodies so it will be dangerous if they become obsessed
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 39.72 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion sport is essential is an essential activity for stay healthy so young people should practice it very often
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 7.25 <o,Q5,B2,P4> we usually buy honey at shops but have you ever thought how is it produced
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 7.25 13.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 13.40 17.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and with this nectar bees make honey in their beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 17.80 22.18 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the beekeepers take the honey from the beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 22.18 29.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the next step is to put the honey in a receipt so as to be distribute in shops
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 29.82 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally the honey is in a stock so people can buy it
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 10.69 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that i won't have any doubts choosing a country which is what would it will be italy
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271 10.69 16.07 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) since i was little i have always wanted to go there
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271 16.07 17.07 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't know why
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271 17.07 20.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but i will choose it yeah
SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 5.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it help us to travel around the world
SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271 5.94 11.45 <o,Q5,B1,P5> we go we can nu communicate with other people
SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271 11.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> also we can find a job (%hesitation%) quickliers if we have if we know how to speak another language
SI127E-01271-P50021 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 6.69 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i believe that at first (%hesitation%) the most difficult thing is to get on with people
SI127E-01271-P50021 1 SI127E-01271 6.69 14.19 <o,Q4,B1,P5> however with (%hesitation%) by the time you you find it (%hesitation%) easy
SI127E-01271-P50021 1 SI127E-01271 14.19 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so the most difficult maybe is (%hesitation%) to be alone
SI127E-01271-P50022 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 15.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that most easy way to learn about the culture is travelling around the local place so you can find many (%hesitation%) cultural landmarks
SI127E-01271-P50022 1 SI127E-01271 15.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> or you can you go to
SI127E-01271-P50023 1 SI127E-01271 0.00 8.64 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i totally agree because you are alone when you go abroad to study
SI127E-01271-P50023 1 SI127E-01271 8.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so you have to make your meal to wash your your clothes

SI127E-01294-P10006 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 14.05 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i live apart from where i i'm originally from so in my holiday i go back to my home to spend time with my family especially with my brother
SI127E-01294-P10006 1 SI127E-01294 14.05 17.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i play the video game just like once a year
SI127E-01294-P10006 1 SI127E-01294 17.70 21.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> it's like a competition and it is really fun
SI127E-01294-P10007 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 7.44 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i told it to previous question however (%hesitation%) it's going to be my little brother
SI127E-01294-P10007 1 SI127E-01294 7.44 17.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> this is because i play the video game with him or you know i we play the same sport (%hesitation%) baseball so we do a catch (%hesitation%) together
SI127E-01294-P10007 1 SI127E-01294 17.36 22.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and a lot of the time spending is really always fun
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 6.24 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i would like to have the job of airline pilot
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 6.24 11.79 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) this is because (%hesitation%) it was just my childhood dream since i was very little
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 11.79 17.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also this is sometime calling the dream too
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 17.52 21.16 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think that's what i want to be
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 13.08 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i think that (%hesitation%) there are lots of pros and cons of (%hesitation%) getting a job to pay for their university (stu-) (%hesitation%) studies (%hesitation%)
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 13.08 38.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> the first the one of the advantage is that you can get the job experience to kind (%hesitation%) to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out that (%hesitation%) what the student need (%hesitation%) in the future like specific (%hesitation%) skills and any (%hesitation%) anything that the student can learn
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 38.30 45.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> and also the disadvantage will be that that the focus will be on the job not the study
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 45.48 50.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion that the student should (%hesitation%) do a little bit of a job
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 50.70 55.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> however they should mainly focus on their study in the university
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 55.70 61.46 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in that way you can explore your interest
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 11.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will present about how to travel by the airplane
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 11.09 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) we have three step after you got to the airport until you board to the airport (%hesitation%) board to the airplane
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 19.95 24.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> so once you get to the airport you have to check in
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 24.67 35.26 <o,Q5,C,P4> yeah you have to check in your luggage and also i (%hesitation%) give the clerk to (tha-) your (id-) identification and ticket
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 35.26 39.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then you go through the document control
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 39.13 47.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in the document control you have to show your passport and identification to check you are the right person to get in
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 47.30 49.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> and also the final security
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 49.62 59.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> you (%hesitation%) the officer will check your baggage inside of the bag that you don't have anything (%hesitation%) any weapons and some
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 59.08 61.28 <o,Q5,C,P4> and you get on board
SI127E-01294-P50019 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 11.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the best thing about the technology on studying is that you should (%hesitation%) you don't have to carry a lot of textbooks and notes
SI127E-01294-P50019 1 SI127E-01294 11.30 21.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think if you got a ipad or something like the technologies you you can take a note on that and also you can see the textbook on that
SI127E-01294-P50020 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 21.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think the learning on like face to face is (%hesitation%) great but this is because that i can i can show the teacher that where i the part that i don't get it and teacher can focus on (%hesitation%) (st-) (%hesitation%) just teaching on that to me
SI127E-01294-P50021 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 12.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that by doing the group project (%hesitation%) the students can get (%hesitation%) the stable i would say stable knowledge
SI127E-01294-P50021 1 SI127E-01294 12.17 21.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is because like the students will explain to each other about the what you got and in that way the the knowledge just stays in your mind
SI127E-01294-P50022 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 3.67 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) yes i think so too
SI127E-01294-P50022 1 SI127E-01294 3.67 16.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> this is because you can understand where teacher's just focused on by his his or her tone of speaking and also the pace of speaking
SI127E-01294-P50022 1 SI127E-01294 16.91 20.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think this is teacher's just the best thing that you got
SI127E-01294-P50022 1 SI127E-01294 20.82 21.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so yeah
SI127E-01294-P50023 1 SI127E-01294 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion it's not that
SI127E-01294-P50023 1 SI127E-01294 4.34 14.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it's very very important to keep it modern because the especially what i research about is just changing just day by day
SI127E-01294-P50023 1 SI127E-01294 14.38 21.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and in that case if you have old (%hesitation%) experimental stuff you cannot maybe you cannot expect the experiment
SI127E-01318-P10005 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 1.21 <o,Q5,B1,P1> really
SI127E-01318-P10005 1 SI127E-01318 1.21 2.66 <o,Q5,B1,P1> is a good question
SI127E-01318-P10005 1 SI127E-01318 2.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my university studies are about (%hesitation%) environmental sciences and in fact my my interest in the environment is higher and i know a lot of things about that
SI127E-01318-P10006 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 1.95 <o,Q5,B1,P1> a lot of things
SI127E-01318-P10006 1 SI127E-01318 1.95 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i stay with my friends (%hesitation%) we usually go to journey to the mountains take photos (%hesitation%) and mainly (%hesitation%) stay together
SI127E-01318-P10007 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if i have to choose one i choose my uncle because he loves photography and i love photography too (%hesitation%) and we speak a lot about that
SI127E-01318-P10008 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> if i could choose (%hesitation%) i would life with my brother in in panama city (fo-) because it's a small (%hesitation%) a big city and wonderful city and i love it
SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 11.19 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as i see it the main advantage of do fitness classes at the schools and college it's the health of their students
SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 11.19 17.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> regarding the disadvantage (%hesitation%) i reckon that they are less than the advantage
SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 17.72 24.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main disadvantage in my opinion it's students' tiredness
SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 24.49 32.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i mean if they arrive tired to other classes their performance will go down
SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 32.54 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as far as i'm concern (%hesitation%) the fact of do any kind of exercise at the schools and college is good for the students and for the profession in general

SI127E-01318-P50023 1 SI127E-01318 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i agree with this statement because in my case i live with my parents and i don't know how is live for my life alone like independent and it's a disadvantage

SI127E-01342-P10006 1 SI127E-01342 5.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i often go do surfing because my house is very close to the beach

SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 5.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think there are two advantages for students
SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 5.74 10.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first they can acquire new skills
SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 10.08 19.25 <o,Q4,B2,P3> second they can manage their themselves about their money
SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 19.25 27.77 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand they can they spend less time studying
SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 27.77 31.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this is a disadvantage for students
SI127E-01342-P30017 1 SI127E-01342 31.84 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think i students should not get jobs to pay for their university studies because it is important for students to study
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 6.39 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i will give you a presentation about traveling by airplane
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 6.39 11.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first travel to airport
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 11.31 19.93 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can get taxi or train or buses to airport
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 19.93 31.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and and then you have to go to the counter and check in and document control and the security
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 31.80 39.11 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you passed all this section
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 39.11 41.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you have to wait ten minutes
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 41.73 45.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can go to cafe
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 45.59 49.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> you can buy something in there
SI127E-01342-P40018 1 SI127E-01342 49.26 55.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that you aboard boarding time

SI127E-01342-P50020 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 17.24 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think so too because to study it is important for studying something to ask some questions
SI127E-01342-P50020 1 SI127E-01342 17.24 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> so it is important
SI127E-01342-P50021 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> they can acquire a skill to communicate with someone and can achieve together a same thing
SI127E-01342-P50022 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think so because attending lectures the teacher can can give us a main point to study
SI127E-01342-P50023 1 SI127E-01342 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it's very important because after the graduate from school we need to use use it in the future

SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 9.35 15.37 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think that this topic it's so very important because this one has a lot of advantage
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 15.37 28.10 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example all the students increase your happiness increase your (%hesitation%) your lifestyle and maybe increase your (%hesitation%) increase a lot of things
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 28.10 38.98 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the principal increase your positive attitude increase (%hesitation%) your mental healthy your healthy as like healthy lifestyle
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 38.98 42.26 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think that is one that have don't have a disadvantage
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 42.26 47.39 <o,Q5,B1,P3> maybe i think that is no very (%hesitation%) very stressful for the students
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 47.39 58.68 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and my opinion it's so very important that all the students do the fitness classes every day and i think that is very important that the schools include this business fitness classes
SI127E-01376-P30017 1 SI127E-01376 58.68 60.04 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think those are very important
SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 0.00 1.61 <o,Q5,B1,P4> hi to everyone
SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 1.61 6.30 <o,Q5,B1,P4> today i'm going to talk about how honey is produced

SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 10.64 20.87 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so the first (%hesitation%) step is the bees collect nectar from a collect (%hesitation%) collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 20.87 27.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so the second step is the bees make honey for nectar in beehives
SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 27.11 33.60 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the next step is the beekeepers (co-) collect honey for beehives

SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 41.55 57.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and after this honey is distribution to different (%hesitation%) stores and differents (%hesitation%) departments for example in the suburbs and differents stores of the whatever city
SI127E-01376-P40018 1 SI127E-01376 57.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> i think that is (e-) very important

SI127E-01376-P50020 1 SI127E-01376 0.00 12.84 <o,Q4,B1,P5> oh my god i think that this question is very important for example if you study in the second language you have a lot of opportunities in the future increase your experience increase your performance increase your engagement
SI127E-01376-P50020 1 SI127E-01376 12.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and i think that is so very important because you have a lot of opportunities when you work and when you study in whatever school
SI127E-01376-P50021 1 SI127E-01376 0.00 8.43 <o,Q5,B1,P5> obviously it's very difficult of studying in another country because you are away from your family

SI127E-01376-P50022 1 SI127E-01376 0.00 15.84 <o,Q5,B1,P5> oh my god for example when the another when the student is studying in another country maybe learn the local culture for example the food the places the customs the lives the lives in this place
SI127E-01376-P50022 1 SI127E-01376 15.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> maybe study in in and learn this school in the
SI127E-01376-P50023 1 SI127E-01376 0.00 11.28 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes i think if you have the opportunity to study in another country you become into independent and i think that is very useful in your life
SI127E-01376-P50023 1 SI127E-01376 11.28 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because it's very important that you consider study in another country because it's the best experience of your life and you have opportunity in the
SI127E-01383-P10005 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 5.67 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in fact rosario it's remarkably huge so it has a lot of different parts
SI127E-01383-P10005 1 SI127E-01383 5.67 10.22 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's totally lively and full of parks and open spaces
SI127E-01383-P10005 1 SI127E-01383 10.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it's totally enjoyable and delightful
SI127E-01383-P10006 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 10.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i don't have any obligation i'm keen on watching series and films and also listening to music as i think it helps me to relax myself
SI127E-01383-P10006 1 SI127E-01383 10.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and another hobby that i have is cooking which i think i'm really good at
SI127E-01383-P10007 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 4.31 <o,Q5,B2,P1> actually with my mum as we have lots of things in common
SI127E-01383-P10007 1 SI127E-01383 4.31 6.13 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we both are adventurous
SI127E-01383-P10007 1 SI127E-01383 6.13 10.59 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we like to visit new places and also we love to train and do exercise
SI127E-01383-P10007 1 SI127E-01383 10.59 13.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so we have a really good time when we are together
SI127E-01383-P10007 1 SI127E-01383 13.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i love her
SI127E-01383-P10008 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 5.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i'm into ballet i hope i can spend the rest of my life practicing it
SI127E-01383-P10008 1 SI127E-01383 5.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i wish i can join a company and become a professional dancer
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 9.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion is great for students to take jobs as their parents won't have to pay for everything and it will be easier and cheaper for them
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 9.40 16.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also students can earn work experience and they will be more qualified when they finish college
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 16.91 22.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they won't have much time left to study
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 22.00 32.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and that's why they will have to be really well organised in order to be able to do both activities studying and working
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 32.02 35.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also this could be really really tiring
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 35.48 42.59 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion this would be an awesome experience for students and really helpful for their parents
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 42.59 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it's a really good option
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 1.90 <o,Q5,C,P4> hi everyone
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 1.90 7.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> today i will explain which are all the things you need to do to travel by airplane
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 7.32 15.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all as you see in the first picture you need to travel to the airport and you can choose any mean of transport you want
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 15.61 18.71 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example you can go by car by bus or by train
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 18.71 27.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> then after you arrive there you'll need to do the check in where your documents will be controlled
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 27.65 36.64 <o,Q5,C,P4> there's also a security control where the luggage you'll board with you on the plane will be checked
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 36.64 46.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you will you will you be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 46.08 49.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you'll finally be able to board on your plane
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 49.78 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after all that steps your flight will start
SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 2.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it has a lot of advantages
SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383 2.62 7.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example students can write long documents or reports faster and in an easy way
SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383 7.96 12.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also they'll be able to save them all in the same place
SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383 12.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and in addition they can search for any information they need on the internet and do investigations
SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 5.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have start learning virtually
SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383 5.89 10.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it has been proved that both methods have their own advantages
SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383 10.33 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it'll depend on each student which one to choose maybe depending on their likes and preferences
SI127E-01383-P50021 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 1.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (tally-)
SI127E-01383-P50021 1 SI127E-01383 1.01 7.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they can get to know how to get organised when they are working with other people for example how to involve each other's opinions
SI127E-01383-P50021 1 SI127E-01383 7.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but also they learn to pay attention to everyone and discuss different topics by using their own thoughts and defending their ideas
SI127E-01383-P50022 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 6.67 <o,Q5,B2,P5> definitely as i think that teachers can explain any subject in a more interesting and easy way
SI127E-01383-P50022 1 SI127E-01383 6.67 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it'll be much more faster for students to understand everything than if they try to do it on their own
SI127E-01383-P50023 1 SI127E-01383 0.00 4.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's remarkably necessary as they can provide a wide variety of advantages

SI127E-01383-P50023 1 SI127E-01383 9.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> also as they have a lot of different course every work they have to do turns faster and easier

SI127E-01399-P50021 1 SI127E-01399 9.84 14.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and then i think the for example the weather

SI127E-01441-P10005 1 SI127E-01441 0.00 19.55 <o,Q5,B2,P1> from my point of view learning from another countries should be one of the most important issues in life due to the fact that if you (%hesitation%) are interesting in learning a new culture or learn a new language it is important to meet another people
SI127E-01441-P10005 1 SI127E-01441 19.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and (no-)
SI127E-01441-P10006 1 SI127E-01441 0.00 8.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> what i like the most (%hesitation%) for enjoying my (fre-) spare time my free time is to be with friends to be with family
SI127E-01441-P10006 1 SI127E-01441 8.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and what i love the most is to just make a make a go for a walk maybe just to spend time together having dinner lunch you know spend time with them at the
SI127E-01441-P10007 1 SI127E-01441 0.00 4.07 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am try many things to improve my english
SI127E-01441-P10007 1 SI127E-01441 4.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but from my point of view (%hesitation%) the best way to improve my english is to have a friend or to have somebody near you that can talk to you in english as well as listen the radio and all the movies in original (ver-)
SI127E-01441-P10008 1 SI127E-01441 0.00 9.89 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i have the opportunity to learn a new skill i would probably choose to learn to play piano
SI127E-01441-P10008 1 SI127E-01441 9.89 13.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the reason why is because i have always loved music
SI127E-01441-P10008 1 SI127E-01441 13.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and piano is for me the instrument that gives you i don't know it's like a very sensitive
SI127E-01441-P30017 1 SI127E-01441 0.00 17.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion about to get a part job (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) during the time we are in the higher school i mean (%hesitation%) during the university is that there are few advantages which mean that they can get money and they can be free and they can be independent from their fathers
SI127E-01441-P30017 1 SI127E-01441 17.54 32.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and on the other hand there are few disadvantages as they are for instance that you have less time for studying you have less time for spending with your friend as well and with your girlfriend
SI127E-01441-P30017 1 SI127E-01441 32.98 50.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and everything can seem very nice and on the other hand when you are working you can meet a lot of people and you can enjoy your practice if the job has (%hesitation%) in relation with the (%hesitation%) subject that you are studying in the university
SI127E-01441-P30017 1 SI127E-01441 50.47 54.79 <o,Q4,B2,P3> apart from that i think (%hesitation%) is not nothing wrong with that
SI127E-01441-P30017 1 SI127E-01441 54.79 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i would agree that every student

SI127E-01441-P40018 1 SI127E-01441 35.27 38.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) it is called (a-) (%hesitation%) acid rain

SI127E-01441-P50020 1 SI127E-01441 8.31 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that means that we are going to have the right quantity of water that our body need to be (%hesitation%) healthy and in

SI127E-01441-P50021 1 SI127E-01441 10.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the best thing to do is to keep a good (%hesitation%) eating habits and then to practice exercise at

SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 26.99 42.44 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and (%hesitation%) the disadvantages is that if they don't if they have (%hesitation%) so much like work it's gonna be they don't have much time to study which is (%hesitation%) the most important for (stud-) student

SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 7.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> all right so i am talking about what i what we need to do to travel by airplane
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 7.11 12.54 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 12.54 21.01 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and first step is that (%hesitation%) we travel to airport by car by bus or by train
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 21.01 30.25 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then (%hesitation%) you have to you when arrive to you when you arrived at airport you have to check in to the counter
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 30.25 37.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and you have to show the document about yourself and (%hesitation%) the counter people check the (con-) document
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 37.91 43.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then also you have to check the security that you 're your security
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 43.88 52.89 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and (als-) and then you can (%hesitation%) you can have time to wait to like (re-) take a rest or drink a coffee
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 52.89 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then you and then after that you will board to the airplane and then enjoy your flying
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 6.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> okay so i talking about how how can use technology more effectively to study
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528 6.38 16.96 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like a application in the smartphone
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528 16.96 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think it is easy to do it and it's not so
SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 2.27 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah i agree with that
SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528 2.27 12.37 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is that (%hesitation%) is that good for like communication with other people
SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528 12.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> like if that we are communicating with other people it's gonna be like we can study
SI127E-01528-P50021 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 6.54 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in group project a student can get (%hesitation%) communication skills
SI127E-01528-P50021 1 SI127E-01528 6.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) for example like if there's someone there is someone who doesn't know about it and someone can teach to someone that is good
SI127E-01528-P50022 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 13.18 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah i think so (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) because like attending lecture is (%hesitation%) i we don't have to we don't have to do by ourselves
SI127E-01528-P50022 1 SI127E-01528 13.18 17.45 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i mean they just going to the class and taking a lecture
SI127E-01528-P50022 1 SI127E-01528 17.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's easy to take it
SI127E-01528-P50023 1 SI127E-01528 0.00 9.16 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think it is not so important to (%hesitation%) take modern (langua-) learning facilities in the school
SI127E-01528-P50023 1 SI127E-01528 9.16 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i mean you know it is it's (%hesitation%) if there is it's better but (%hesitation%) it doesn't matter that we have learn or not
SI127E-01573-P10005 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i always have been interesting to learn about other countries
SI127E-01573-P10005 1 SI127E-01573 4.71 20.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> actually i have been living in italy and in new zealand as well because i want to learn from other cultures the way that they live the way that they eat and all surrounding about that new place
SI127E-01573-P10006 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.51 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the most part of my free time i'm outside

SI127E-01573-P10006 1 SI127E-01573 15.26 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we can say that we go to climb mountain biking and hiking
SI127E-01573-P10007 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.78 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i have too many techniques to improve my english
SI127E-01573-P10007 1 SI127E-01573 4.78 11.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> one of that is try to speak in english with every speaker person english person that i find
SI127E-01573-P10007 1 SI127E-01573 11.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and on the other hand i try to watch every movie and every tv show in english if i can
SI127E-01573-P10008 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.61 <o,Q5,B2,P1> probably i will choose to learn to drive a motorbike
SI127E-01573-P10008 1 SI127E-01573 4.61 14.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i never been a a good driver no even cars so on the last two years i have been seriously thinking about to get a cool motorbike
SI127E-01573-P10008 1 SI127E-01573 14.82 18.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but on the other hand i don't have the license
SI127E-01573-P10008 1 SI127E-01573 18.00 20.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i try to be on there
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 10.45 <o,Q5,B2,P3> like every decision in life when we work when we are studying at the university it have some advantage and disadvantage
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 10.45 26.26 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory learns and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it in practice when you work
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 26.26 34.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> at the same time that part time work give you some economy resources that you can use in your daily basis
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 34.20 37.89 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand it have some disadvantage as well
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 37.89 47.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you have less time to spend with your friends you has less time to study and you have less time to practice a sport
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 47.31 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion it's all about to find (%hesitation%) a good balance between your part time your student time and your work time
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 9.72 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the acid rain is one of the main consequence of our activity as a human being on this planet
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 9.72 15.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> all start with our factories and our vehicles that produce smoke
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 15.91 23.41 <o,Q5,B1,P4> that smoke carry on too many acid particulars that they go up until the sky
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 23.41 34.34 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the rain goes down and take that particles in our forest in our lakes in our food indefinitely
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 34.34 36.36 <o,Q5,B1,P4> why i say in our food
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 36.36 45.27 <o,Q5,B1,P4> because that particles go to the water and that water have our (f-) the fishes that we later will eat
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 45.27 51.13 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so at the end all that pollution get in our own bodies
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 51.13 58.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> at the same time that rain get into the fruit that we eat as well on the forest and on the farms
SI127E-01573-P40018 1 SI127E-01573 58.62 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so
SI127E-01573-P50019 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 11.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if i if i will have to say (%hesitation%) just one advantage for the people to develop good food habit it will be don't eat processed food
SI127E-01573-P50019 1 SI127E-01573 11.93 13.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's that simple
SI127E-01573-P50019 1 SI127E-01573 13.36 16.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> processed food doesn't give you enough calories
SI127E-01573-P50019 1 SI127E-01573 16.43 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> processed food poison you
SI127E-01573-P50019 1 SI127E-01573 18.41 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so stop
SI127E-01573-P50020 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.21 <o,Q5,B2,P5> drinking water is as important as breathe
SI127E-01573-P50020 1 SI127E-01573 4.21 7.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we actually need water for survive
SI127E-01573-P50020 1 SI127E-01573 7.10 11.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we just have to think that most part of our bodies are water
SI127E-01573-P50020 1 SI127E-01573 11.83 19.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so we have to refuel that amount of water with drinking at least one litre per day
SI127E-01573-P50020 1 SI127E-01573 19.39 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> at least
SI127E-01573-P50021 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 4.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes it's absolutely essential to do exercise every day
SI127E-01573-P50021 1 SI127E-01573 4.55 9.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we when we say that we don't have to think about to do a sport
SI127E-01573-P50021 1 SI127E-01573 9.20 13.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> when we say exercise it can be walking around your neighborhood

SI127E-01573-P50022 1 SI127E-01573 0.00 12.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i'm agree with that but on the other hand the reality is that there are people who just can sleep for six hours and they work really well
SI127E-01573-P50022 1 SI127E-01573 12.08 17.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's not an (%hesitation%) absolutely main kind of hour for everyone
SI127E-01573-P50022 1 SI127E-01573 17.74 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> is just depends of the person

SI127E-01573-P50023 1 SI127E-01573 9.62 18.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology can provide us too many apps which we can learn how to eat how to exercise and how to sleep well
SI127E-01573-P50023 1 SI127E-01573 18.91 20.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's all about the

SI127E-01580-P10008 1 SI127E-01580 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> the power of communication because i think it is (%hesitation%) very important to to communicate with other people in a in a good way be so they can have a good image of us
SI127E-01580-P30017 1 SI127E-01580 0.00 21.10 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) (universi-) (uni-) university students should do part time jobs how they are studying because it helps them it helped them it helps them how to interact with others and knowing better the worlds of work

SI127E-01676-P10007 1 SI127E-01676 6.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> sometimes we are the same person
SI127E-01676-P10008 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like to live in spain maybe in the north of spain
SI127E-01676-P30017 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 7.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it is a very interesting topic
SI127E-01676-P30017 1 SI127E-01676 7.66 9.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i agree with it
SI127E-01676-P30017 1 SI127E-01676 9.20 13.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it has both advantage and disadvantage
SI127E-01676-P30017 1 SI127E-01676 13.54 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main advantage is that it can make you feel better but you should not obsess about it
SI127E-01676-P40018 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 6.53 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first the best collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01676-P40018 1 SI127E-01676 6.53 12.92 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) after then bees make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI127E-01676-P40018 1 SI127E-01676 12.92 19.74 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
SI127E-01676-P40018 1 SI127E-01676 19.74 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after that after then the ma the the honey is package and is leave to supermarket
SI127E-01676-P50019 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it does have importance but not as much as we think
SI127E-01676-P50020 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it just another tool to improve but i don't think it's the only one
SI127E-01676-P50021 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 12.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the most difficult is to be far from your house from your parents from your friends from your girlfriend
SI127E-01676-P50021 1 SI127E-01676 12.11 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's the most difficult thing
SI127E-01676-P50022 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the students can learn about his food its culture its language its philosophy its weather
SI127E-01676-P50023 1 SI127E-01676 0.00 2.42 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with this
SI127E-01676-P50023 1 SI127E-01676 2.42 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i believe it can improve your life as it has improved the lives of others
SI127E-01688-P10005 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 3.10 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm interested a lot in that actually
SI127E-01688-P10005 1 SI127E-01688 3.10 14.37 <o,Q5,C,P1> my (%hesitation%) first degree is in world economics so i am really interested in communicating with people from other cultures
SI127E-01688-P10005 1 SI127E-01688 14.37 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> this is partially why i came to one of the most multicultural cities in the world toronto
SI127E-01688-P10006 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 4.05 <o,Q5,C,P1> basically my hobby is the same as my primary occupation
SI127E-01688-P10006 1 SI127E-01688 4.05 5.73 <o,Q5,C,P1> i enjoy learning languages
SI127E-01688-P10006 1 SI127E-01688 5.73 8.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> english is not the only foreign language that i can speak
SI127E-01688-P10006 1 SI127E-01688 8.64 12.29 <o,Q5,C,P1> i can also speak french quite fluently and bit of german
SI127E-01688-P10006 1 SI127E-01688 12.29 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> however my german got a bit rusty over time just because of the lack of time for maintenance
SI127E-01688-P10007 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 7.77 <o,Q5,C,P1> i strongly believe that the most natural and the most efficient way to improve any language is to speak to their native speakers
SI127E-01688-P10007 1 SI127E-01688 7.77 16.54 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) so whenever i have the chance and the opportunity i try to communicate with as many native speakers i can encounter as possible
SI127E-01688-P10007 1 SI127E-01688 16.54 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) of course this is pretty easy because i live
SI127E-01688-P10008 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 14.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> well it would definitely be coding because i think this is an essential skill not necessarily in software engineering but in so many other fields from linguistics to (%hesitation%) accounting to financial analysis
SI127E-01688-P10008 1 SI127E-01688 14.70 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so whenever when i have enough time i will definitely start doing
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 11.99 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i know that many people have different approaches towards (%hesitation%) the idea of students doing part time jobs while they are studying
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 11.99 25.49 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the one hand there are some advantages to this like learning proper time management (%hesitation%) developing interpersonal skills being able to communicate with people (fr-) with from different backgrounds
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 25.49 30.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages associated with it as well
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 30.58 43.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example some students may find it hard to prioritise their studies over their part time job and they can get carried away with what they do in their part time job easily
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 43.48 50.67 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i don't think it is always an advantageous situation for the student to do both
SI127E-01688-P30017 1 SI127E-01688 50.67 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> however (%hesitation%) i believe that employers highly appreciate students being more
SI127E-01688-P40018 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 6.86 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this picture represents the cycle of the acid rain in nature
SI127E-01688-P40018 1 SI127E-01688 6.86 12.80 <o,Q5,C,P4> i wish it was a healthy a nice healthy rain but unfortunately this is not the case
SI127E-01688-P40018 1 SI127E-01688 12.80 37.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> so essentially the way acid train originates is that pollution is evaporated from factory chimneys and vehicles into the atmosphere and acid particles (%hesitation%) in smoke in the form of sno smoke are carried by the wind towards the upper layers of the atmosphere
SI127E-01688-P40018 1 SI127E-01688 37.58 51.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then they are carried further in different directions after which some acid particles fall out as dust (%hesitation%) and some other acid (pa-) particles mix with cloud water
SI127E-01688-P40018 1 SI127E-01688 51.45 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after being some time within the clouds they either fall on the earth in the
SI127E-01688-P50019 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i would definitely advise that they eat as much vegetables and fruits as possible and (%hesitation%) that they eat regularly and avoid eating (bef-) just before bed or eating too much during their lunchtime
SI127E-01688-P50020 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 8.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it's definitely very important to drink lots of water although i know some scientists start to contest this premise
SI127E-01688-P50020 1 SI127E-01688 8.23 16.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so essentially (%hesitation%) drinking anywhere between five to eight glasses of water per day is considered healthy
SI127E-01688-P50020 1 SI127E-01688 16.94 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and they say it
SI127E-01688-P50021 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 7.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i would say it is essential to do exercise (%hesitation%) at least every second day
SI127E-01688-P50021 1 SI127E-01688 7.46 15.78 <o,Q5,C,P5> every day would be ideal but unfortunately i know it may not necessarily be (%hesitation%) feasible for everyone
SI127E-01688-P50021 1 SI127E-01688 15.78 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i believe twice
SI127E-01688-P50022 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 2.18 <o,Q5,C,P5> well it depends on the person
SI127E-01688-P50022 1 SI127E-01688 2.18 12.02 <o,Q5,C,P5> i know some friends of mine can (%hesitation%) easily cope with six hours of sleep whereas i am not this kind of person
SI127E-01688-P50022 1 SI127E-01688 12.02 13.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> i need more hours of sleep
SI127E-01688-P50022 1 SI127E-01688 13.63 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i eight hours (%hesitation%) is an ideal number but sometimes i sleep more
SI127E-01688-P50023 1 SI127E-01688 0.00 1.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> well it it depends on how you look at it
SI127E-01688-P50023 1 SI127E-01688 1.98 8.98 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course there were lot of negative effects like we were we're becoming more and more sedentary just because of the technology use
SI127E-01688-P50023 1 SI127E-01688 8.98 13.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> we're not (%hesitation%) confined to our screen at work only
SI127E-01688-P50023 1 SI127E-01688 13.73 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> we're also looking constantly at our screens while commuting or while
SI127E-01689-P10005 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 15.92 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interested in (envi-) in environment because environment is our asset to be succeeded to next generation
SI127E-01689-P10005 1 SI127E-01689 15.92 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we have to take care of it
SI127E-01689-P10006 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we enjoy playing golf but if weather condition is not good we will go shopping or watching movies to enjoy ourselves
SI127E-01689-P10007 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 4.19 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my son is most similar to me
SI127E-01689-P10007 1 SI127E-01689 4.19 11.18 <o,Q4,B2,P1> although i'm not sure if he is so happy that he is similar to me
SI127E-01689-P10007 1 SI127E-01689 11.18 18.21 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but everybody (%hesitation%) pointed out that his attitude is quite similar to me
SI127E-01689-P10007 1 SI127E-01689 18.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's very fine
SI127E-01689-P10008 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i can select wherever i want i want to be i want to live nearby the sea because i my hobby is fishing so i can enjoy fishing every day after retirement
SI127E-01689-P30017 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 16.09 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's no doubt that fitness is (%hesitation%) very essential to keep healthy (%hesitation%) for students
SI127E-01689-P30017 1 SI127E-01689 16.09 32.39 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so the biggest advantage is keeping students healthy and they can (%hesitation%) concentrate on studying very much
SI127E-01689-P30017 1 SI127E-01689 32.39 42.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but disadvantages is students will lose the time to study
SI127E-01689-P30017 1 SI127E-01689 42.05 48.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so they have to take care of their time management
SI127E-01689-P30017 1 SI127E-01689 48.63 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but as a result my opinion is that i agree the (ti-) to make time for fitness class
SI127E-01689-P40018 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 16.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i want to explain the flows to show how we can get sweet honey at supermarket
SI127E-01689-P40018 1 SI127E-01689 16.52 19.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so from the beginning
SI127E-01689-P40018 1 SI127E-01689 19.92 36.28 <o,Q4,B2,P4> at the beginning of course bees collect nectar from flowers and farmers (%hesitation%) collect honey from beehives
SI127E-01689-P40018 1 SI127E-01689 36.28 56.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they can they will pack the honey into small bottles and deliver to supermarket where we can buy the honey
SI127E-01689-P40018 1 SI127E-01689 56.29 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so
SI127E-01689-P50019 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 6.41 <o,Q4,B1,P5> of course language in the country is well key
SI127E-01689-P50019 1 SI127E-01689 6.41 16.10 <o,Q4,B1,P5> however the other and very essential factors is the safety
SI127E-01689-P50019 1 SI127E-01689 16.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> safety is required for study
SI127E-01689-P50020 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 15.52 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because it is a second language the speaker also very take care of their body language
SI127E-01689-P50020 1 SI127E-01689 15.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's easy for us to understand second language
SI127E-01689-P50021 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in addition to the language the lifestyle and culture is also very big handicap for students especially at the beginning of entering the country
SI127E-01689-P50022 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 12.29 <o,Q5,B1,P5> they can learn local culture by touching (%hesitation%) contacting with the culture
SI127E-01689-P50022 1 SI127E-01689 12.29 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P5> that is the most essential harvest for student at the abroad
SI127E-01689-P50023 1 SI127E-01689 0.00 4.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i fully agree with that
SI127E-01689-P50023 1 SI127E-01689 4.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> students should (%hesitation%) live alone and independently in abroad because they are away from their parents
SI127E-01826-P10005 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time of year in in italy is the summer because the weather is very good and you have time to spend with friends your family
SI127E-01826-P10005 1 SI127E-01826 11.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i especially like to play soccer and other sports
SI127E-01826-P10006 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 14.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> listen and read the news is very important because you have to know what is the situation in your locality in your city in your town in your in your country
SI127E-01826-P10006 1 SI127E-01826 14.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> you have to be informed
SI127E-01826-P10007 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i was a child i really spent my free time playing whatever video game like fifa or playing soccer with my brother or spending time with my mom
SI127E-01826-P10008 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 2.15 <o,Q5,B2,P1> actually i don't really know
SI127E-01826-P10008 1 SI127E-01826 2.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think it could be continue with the family company because i know that i can help to improve some process like sales or something
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 10.09 <o,Q5,B2,P3> as you know nowadays all university courses should include a period of practical work experience and it is very good
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 10.09 14.83 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but do you know what are the advantages of that
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 14.83 16.13 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's easy
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 16.13 33.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the highest advantage of that is that it could help you to get a lot of new knowledge or new experience or something that you would be using in the future in your area of your work
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 33.41 37.64 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there are lot of (%hesitation%) disadvantages
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 37.64 48.68 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you won't be able to spend time that you would like to or with your friends or you would be stressed in the future
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 48.68 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion i think it is important to all students to include a period of practical work experience because it will help them in the future
SI127E-01826-P40018 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 10.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as you know nowadays there is a lot of apps or websites that you can use to listen music online
SI127E-01826-P40018 1 SI127E-01826 10.77 21.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but we will be focus on three tunes net that are the red one music now that are the blue one and usongs for you that are the yellow one
SI127E-01826-P40018 1 SI127E-01826 21.62 37.08 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and as you can see on average the blue one that are music now has the highest number of people listening their music per day
SI127E-01826-P40018 1 SI127E-01826 37.08 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) but you can see too that the tunes net has a considerable increasing until five fifth day
SI127E-01826-P50019 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> a good team leader have to have some aptitude to improve and develop the the performance of the team for example leadership honestly a good communication (%hesitation%) things like that
SI127E-01826-P50020 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think there is a lot of problems if you are working in small teams but one could be that the work won't be divided equitably so you can have a lot of work
SI127E-01826-P50021 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> no i don't think that the team members should be encouraged to disagree with the other team members because you have to have a very good communication between the team members and it will improve the coordination to make work
SI127E-01826-P50022 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i don't think that the teamwork have to be always face to face between the team members but most of the times it could be helpful because in this way you have more opportunity to (%hesitation%) speak with your members and have a good communication
SI127E-01826-P50023 1 SI127E-01826 0.00 2.91 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i am completely agree with that

SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 13.46 15.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) well there are also disadvantages
SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 15.75 21.27 <o,Q4,C,P3> they have probably less time to study and to prepare themselves for exams
SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 21.27 32.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) the worst thing is that is is that they can engage less (%hesitation%) on the university activities and it can truly damage (%hesitation%) their academical prospect
SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 32.13 50.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) well in my point of view it is better for the (st-) for students not to work during (%hesitation%) their courses because they have to to to dedicate themselves full time for their university and not (%hesitation%) with a job that that will probably not not have any relationship (%hesitation%) with their future profession
SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 50.91 57.11 <o,Q4,C,P3> then i guess they should take a student loan or ask money for their for their for their parents
SI127E-01880-P30017 1 SI127E-01880 57.11 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) this is what i think about
SI127E-01880-P40018 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 8.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> well (%hesitation%) this diagram gives (informa-) gives general information about procedures before taking (%hesitation%) an airplane
SI127E-01880-P40018 1 SI127E-01880 8.13 15.28 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all you have to get to the airport by bus by train or with a personal car also with with a taxi

SI127E-01880-P40018 1 SI127E-01880 26.36 34.83 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after that you gotta look for the for the (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (doc-) for the officers to show your your document

SI127E-01880-P40018 1 SI127E-01880 46.16 49.50 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to wait until your flight's being called
SI127E-01880-P40018 1 SI127E-01880 49.50 51.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can have a coffee go to the restroom

SI127E-01880-P50019 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,C,P5> students nowaday are deeply privileged with the amount of technology available in order to study
SI127E-01880-P50019 1 SI127E-01880 7.41 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> they can access youtube channels they can have online books they can also buy (%hesitation%) they can also download plenty of p d fs (%hesitation%) of books (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) there are also applications
SI127E-01880-P50020 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 9.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> it may be best better to to learn (dir-) directly with a teacher but it's not the (on-) it's not the only way of (%hesitation%) of learning
SI127E-01880-P50020 1 SI127E-01880 9.34 15.52 <o,Q5,C,P5> people can learn (%hesitation%) from the internet via skype people can also learn alone at home with books
SI127E-01880-P50020 1 SI127E-01880 15.52 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i i guess that the internet is the biggest teacher nowadays
SI127E-01880-P50021 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 17.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> the most important thing on working tore together (%hesitation%) in groups and so on is (%hesitation%) to exchange idea ideas and to (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to receive feedbacks about your own ideas and also to give feedback about (%hesitation%) the the idea of of a colleague
SI127E-01880-P50021 1 SI127E-01880 17.79 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and so i think you can grow a lot in
SI127E-01880-P50022 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 3.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think it depends on each student
SI127E-01880-P50022 1 SI127E-01880 3.81 6.61 <o,Q5,C,P5> we can't (ge-) generalize such a thing

SI127E-01880-P50023 1 SI127E-01880 0.00 9.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> well in my point of view modern learning facilities they play a (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) very important role (%hesitation%) on the development of each student
SI127E-01880-P50023 1 SI127E-01880 9.47 17.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) it is it is also take a very important influence on the future of the students because they can learn more effectively
SI127E-01880-P50023 1 SI127E-01880 17.59 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> they can get get access to more information

SI127E-01921-P40018 1 SI127E-01921 0.00 7.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the first step is (%hesitation%) the the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01921-P40018 1 SI127E-01921 7.22 14.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the second step is that bees make honey from nectar in (beeha-) beehives
SI127E-01921-P40018 1 SI127E-01921 14.73 21.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the third step is the beekeepers collect honey from (beehi-) beehives
SI127E-01921-P40018 1 SI127E-01921 21.46 34.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the four step is (%hesitation%) when the honey the honey is put it put putted on (%hesitation%) crystal cans

SI127E-01921-P40018 1 SI127E-01921 43.33 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the last step is when the honey is in the supermarkets

SI127E-01961-P10005 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love learning about (%hesitation%) foreign countries and about their culture about their history about their politics because it this is what it fills my my my soul actually
SI127E-01961-P10006 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 8.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i don't have that much free time but when it came (%hesitation%) i love (%hesitation%) travelling

SI127E-01961-P10008 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 7.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if it was possible i think i would like to learn how to fly
SI127E-01961-P10008 1 SI127E-01961 7.25 10.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but it's not possible actually
SI127E-01961-P10008 1 SI127E-01961 10.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 16.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the advantage of working as a student it's to be financially independent and also to know how professional environment works and how to manage different environment
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 16.82 20.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> but there is also backfires to this
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 20.95 26.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) for example one of the most inconvenient thing is we can be tired
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 26.79 33.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) i mean students can be could be tired from from their part time jobs
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 33.30 42.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> depends on the job (%hesitation%) that they that they do (%hesitation%) delivery or shopper or whatever
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 42.23 56.25 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i think it's a good (%hesitation%) things to have a part time job just to responsibilise (%hesitation%) students on on money and on how what what they want in their lives
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 56.25 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but it has to be short
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 7.69 <o,Q4,C,P4> acid rain is one of the most damage phenomenon to the environment today
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 7.69 12.56 <o,Q4,C,P4> but how this forms in in the environment
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 12.56 20.27 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) factories and vehicles provide or produce c o two which contains acid particle
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 20.27 27.06 <o,Q4,C,P4> this particles in smoke forms smog that are spread in the air
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 27.06 33.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> some of them continues their journey to mix with clouds
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 33.16 41.41 <o,Q4,C,P4> just a reminder that clouds are made up with water and acid particles become a part of the cloud
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 41.41 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> in consequence depends on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large part of particles and acid particles which is lead to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damage to the environment
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 18.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> healthier lifestyle start with nutrition and as far as i'm concerned we must forbidden eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one point five litre day or two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961 18.81 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> whatever
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> our bodies are made with ninety percent of water so (%hesitation%) we should keep that level all all the day because this is where our bodies take all the energy
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961 14.13 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we should drink a lot of water about two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50021 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think (%hesitation%) practice exercise is necessary good every day but like once or twice a week it's it's good for for for physical health but also mental health and to just de stress from our
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 5.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> more we sleep more our life duration is
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961 5.80 13.12 <o,Q5,C,P5> so in my opinion we should keep constant (%hesitation%) the eight hours sleep of sleeping each night
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961 13.12 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961 0.00 13.57 <o,Q5,C,P5> the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we don't have to go to the doctor all the time
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961 13.57 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but the other part is we we such dependent of that
SI127E-01965-P10005 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 6.33 <o,Q4,B2,P1> personal experience i think learning about other countries is really interesting
SI127E-01965-P10005 1 SI127E-01965 6.33 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i love seeing other cultures and knowing about the daily basis life because i think the difference between me and other people it's really amazing
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 5.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually enjoy spending my free time by dancing
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965 5.23 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i tend to watch choreographies and learn them by watching videos and slowing them down
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that way i can really learn the details and dance with them with my partner
SI127E-01965-P10007 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> from personal experience i think the best way that i've learnt english is by watching series reading books and listening to other people talk in english because that way you can really make sure how do you speak it and how do you write it
SI127E-01965-P10008 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 7.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> had the chance to learn new skill i would like to learn about singing
SI127E-01965-P10008 1 SI127E-01965 7.95 16.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> because i've been listening to music since i was a child so to learn how to sing would be a really great point for me
SI127E-01965-P10008 1 SI127E-01965 16.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would have fun with my friends just singing with them
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 6.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> of my talk will be doing part time jobs while studying
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 6.57 13.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the first place i will talk about the disadvantages and then i will talk about the disadvantages
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 13.32 31.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> firstly the advantages i see while studying and doing part time jobs would be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their studying fees
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 31.27 34.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the other hand we have the disadvantages
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 34.47 47.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> one big important disadvantages would be having less time to study which could lead to having less grades lower grades
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 47.54 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will be a bit more difficult
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 51.24 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion as i see it it would be a really good thing to have part time jobs while studying so they can have more (t-) money
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> image we can see a landscape and a diagram which it shows how the acid rain is formed and how it affects the actual landscape
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 12.78 19.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first the vehicles and factories make smoke which makes pollution
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 19.70 28.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the acid particles that are in that in that smoke cause the acid particles carried by the wind
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 28.03 41.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the wind makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the river and some lakes to be to be less clean
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 41.91 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the other acid particles will mix with cloud water which could lead to rain and snow with acid particles in it which will lead to damage the environment and kill some living beings such as trees
SI127E-01965-P50019 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i would recommend to go to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have the full energy throughout the day
SI127E-01965-P50020 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 4.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> lots of water is very important for the day
SI127E-01965-P50020 1 SI127E-01965 4.48 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because our body is made out of seventy percent of water so we really need that water for ourselves to really work throughout the day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 4.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think we need to do exercise every day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965 4.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think it's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep up its shape and be in a healthy weight
SI127E-01965-P50022 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 8.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (ink-) we need at least eight hours of sleep every day because our body needs to rest as well as our brain
SI127E-01965-P50022 1 SI127E-01965 8.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> without sleeping we wouldn't have the energy to go throughout the day the way we need to
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965 0.00 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> generally technology has really improved our health because we don't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it was a better improvement
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 7.44 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm so interested because you can (%hesitation%) learn about other cultures
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981 7.44 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i think is possibly positive in all her sides
SI127E-01981-P10006 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy (%hesitation%) dancing or watching tv and maybe (%hesitation%) painting my books
SI127E-01981-P10007 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe (%hesitation%) the best way is talking with other people of england or united state and you can learn too much about english
SI127E-01981-P10008 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) maybe the italian language
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 19.07 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some advantages that (%hesitation%) jobs (%hesitation%) while student are studying are that (%hesitation%) you maybe knows the real life and you can afford and pay some things that maybe help your parents in the university
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 19.07 31.29 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in the other hand some disadvantages are that you don't have too much time for study and you will sleep less
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 31.29 44.79 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think that you are going to learn (%hesitation%) more about (responsa-) responsibilities and meet other people other other work people
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 44.79 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so definitely it's a good form to spend your time
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 10.58 <o,Q5,B1,P4> that picture show us how acid rain is a product of pollution in our planet
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 10.58 18.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first of all factories and vehicles make acid particles that are in smoke
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 18.49 29.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally we find that particles in the clouds of the planet because are carried by the wind after
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 29.59 39.65 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so acid particles (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) are in rain or snow and fall of in or superfice of planet
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 39.65 46.39 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so yeah is a important damage to environment of our planet
SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 46.39 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and we can (%hesitation%) (w-) we have to change that to have a better planet
SI127E-01981-P50019 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> maybe i think that (%hesitation%) good habit for eating is (%hesitation%) eats a lot of fruit five times for a day and (%hesitation%) eat some salad food two times at week
SI127E-01981-P50020 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 9.56 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's too important to drinking water because sometimes we confuse about drinking water or be hungry
SI127E-01981-P50020 1 SI127E-01981 9.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so i think that one one litre for day is a good habits for eating
SI127E-01981-P50021 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for a person to have a healthy lifestyle (%hesitation%) i think in my opinion that is too important and essential doing exercise (%hesitation%) each week because is elemental part of a healthy life
SI127E-01981-P50022 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 10.77 <o,Q5,B1,P5> every person with a healthy lifestyle need a break (%hesitation%) for the work or i don't know the studies
SI127E-01981-P50022 1 SI127E-01981 10.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so i think that is a very important part of a healthy lifestyle (%hesitation%) sure
SI127E-01981-P50023 1 SI127E-01981 0.00 17.20 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it's depends of the use of the technology that people make because you can use technology for (%hesitation%) doing better exercise but maybe you can use technology to watch netflix
SI127E-01981-P50023 1 SI127E-01981 17.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it depends
SI128D-00015-P10005 1 SI128D-00015 0.00 13.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> here i can't decide that because i'm i'm happy to every day so i cannot decide enjoyed (e-) (o-) of year

SI128D-00015-P30017 1 SI128D-00015 18.73 36.93 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion students should get should get work experience should get work experience and then students more tried to any work

SI128D-00049-P30017 1 SI128D-00049 32.67 47.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion maybe (%hesitation%) the the school day (%hesitation%) no do fitness classes must be (%hesitation%) better in the on the weekend or one day per week al at most but not for all every day

SI128D-00108-P10007 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 10.29 <o,Q4,C,P1> throughout all those years i can say that the best way to improve my english is to listening and speaking

SI128D-00108-P10008 1 SI128D-00108 4.49 8.71 <o,Q4,C,P1> definitely that skill will be to play the piano
SI128D-00108-P10008 1 SI128D-00108 8.71 15.63 <o,Q4,C,P1> to play the piano would be (%hesitation%) a dream life for me

SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 1.98 8.43 <o,Q4,C,P3> i will enjoy to talk about this topic (%hesitation%) the part time jobs while you are studying
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 8.43 23.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> advantages the clear advantages is despite of the money you will earn one great advantages is you will have some independence in your life and you will not depend on your parents
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 23.25 25.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> so that is extremely important for me
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 25.88 45.44 <o,Q4,C,P3> and a clear disadvantages that is part time jobs are not created for everyone because everyone has not the commitment to fulfil all their responsibilities between their studies between her tutions and between her part time jobs
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 45.44 50.18 <o,Q4,C,P3> so those students are not going to fulfill all the requirements
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 50.18 51.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> what is my opinion
SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108 51.95 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> everyone must be aware whether it's in in the group one or two
SI128D-00108-P40018 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 6.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> the acid rain it's something that involves everyone in society
SI128D-00108-P40018 1 SI128D-00108 6.08 18.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> and it should be mandatory for governments and factories to fulfil all the requirements related to go against the acid raiin
SI128D-00108-P40018 1 SI128D-00108 18.38 24.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> you know the acid rain it's represented in every single season of the year
SI128D-00108-P40018 1 SI128D-00108 24.34 35.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> it doesn't matter if you are in summer winter fall autumn (%hesitation%) you will see the risks of the acid rain every day in your single life
SI128D-00108-P40018 1 SI128D-00108 35.98 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> it is a cycle that involves many factors vehicles trees some plants and at the end the damage to the environment it's quite important and significantive so at the end it destroys our nature and our lives
SI128D-00108-P50019 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my most significant advice definitely would be if you mind about your health about your physical appearance and about your good looking and even more about your sexuality you should concern about your eating habits
SI128D-00108-P50019 1 SI128D-00108 17.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> don't eat hamburgers
SI128D-00108-P50020 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 10.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to drink lots of water it's extremely important for our healthy because you know we are seventy percent composed by water
SI128D-00108-P50020 1 SI128D-00108 10.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if an organism like like our organism is composed by water and if you don't drink water so come on is something wrong
SI128D-00108-P50021 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is not essential perhaps it's so important because if we take care of our body doing some exercise so surely when we get old our body will appreciate everything nice we did for it when we were young
SI128D-00108-P50022 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 10.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> people said that just because science has proved that eight hours is a cool average for our health
SI128D-00108-P50022 1 SI128D-00108 10.48 16.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by the way you should try ten twelve hours and will be fine
SI128D-00108-P50022 1 SI128D-00108 16.23 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in other hand if you do just six hours oh my
SI128D-00108-P50023 1 SI128D-00108 0.00 5.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> technology has had a negative effect on people's health
SI128D-00108-P50023 1 SI128D-00108 5.60 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you know many people is developing lot of issues and illness on their eyes on their heads on their hands just because the technology influence in our life
SI12BD-00030-P10005 1 SI12BD-00030 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i live in a small town (%hesitation%) with my my wife in a small flat but we are (%hesitation%) moving to new flat bigger than than this

SI12BD-00030-P10007 1 SI12BD-00030 0.00 9.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to spend my free time (%hesitation%) with my wife and with my parents and also with my nephews

SI12BD-00030-P10008 1 SI12BD-00030 14.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> mainly as (%hesitation%) a teacher and secondary teacher
SI12BD-00030-P30017 1 SI12BD-00030 0.00 32.13 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) the advange the advantage of (%hesitation%) from the of the students (%hesitation%) get jobs to pay their university students the main advantage in my opinion is (%hesitation%) that the students could (%hesitation%) can appreciate the their parents' effort to pay their studies
SI12BD-00030-P30017 1 SI12BD-00030 32.13 49.91 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in the other hand the (dis-) the main disadvantage is that they can't focus on their studies because they (%hesitation%) have to work
SI12BD-00030-P30017 1 SI12BD-00030 49.91 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my my opinion if it's possible i prefer that students (%hesitation%) are focus on

SI12BD-00030-P40018 1 SI12BD-00030 40.59 48.45 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) after that you have to wait your your flight
SI12BD-00030-P40018 1 SI12BD-00030 48.45 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> maybe you (%hesitation%) spend one or two hours (%hesitation%) while your your flight (%hesitation%) take off

SI12BD-00039-P40018 1 SI12BD-00039 5.79 15.98 <o,Q5,B1,P4> waste product from the (vehi-) vehicles and some factories in gas form and some acid particles from their smoke join air then are carried by the wind
SI12BD-00039-P40018 1 SI12BD-00039 15.98 24.81 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after that some part of this particles fall from sky as dust while the other part is mixing with water in clouds

SI12BD-00039-P40018 1 SI12BD-00039 33.58 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this is what we (ca-) called acid rain
SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039 0.00 4.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first thing they should do is cut off junk food
SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039 4.54 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they are really addicted to it they start small and aim higher then
SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039 12.77 18.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i also think gluten free lifestyle is better
SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039 18.85 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i do that
SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039 0.00 3.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's quite important
SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039 3.16 9.57 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we need to drink water at least three liter per day
SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039 9.57 14.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it's really help homeostasis
SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039 14.08 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is great
SI12BD-00039-P50021 1 SI12BD-00039 0.00 6.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> not every day but we should do exercise regularly
SI12BD-00039-P50021 1 SI12BD-00039 6.69 15.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) the days that (%hesitation%) we don't do exercise we should walk instead
SI12BD-00039-P50021 1 SI12BD-00039 15.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we keep ourselfs active
SI12BD-00039-P50022 1 SI12BD-00039 0.00 3.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> depends the on people
SI12BD-00039-P50022 1 SI12BD-00039 3.06 6.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> like i need more than eight hours
SI12BD-00039-P50022 1 SI12BD-00039 6.85 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> sleeping is really good way to reduce toxic in our brain
SI12BD-00039-P50023 1 SI12BD-00039 0.00 3.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it has generally a good effect
SI12BD-00039-P50023 1 SI12BD-00039 3.96 5.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is really positive
SI12BD-00039-P50023 1 SI12BD-00039 5.39 7.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we can do surveys
SI12BD-00039-P50023 1 SI12BD-00039 7.29 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) we keep track on our patients
SI12BD-00039-P50023 1 SI12BD-00039 10.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so technology is quite (use-)
SI12BD-00041-P10005 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 4.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> yeah i live in a very quiet city

SI12BD-00041-P30017 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 28.01 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantage that all students should get job to pay for university students i think that are about (%hesitation%) you you (%hesitation%) increase your experience at the at the at the industrial or or commercial field and helps so much to in your development
SI12BD-00041-P30017 1 SI12BD-00041 28.01 43.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but disadvantage that (%hesitation%) normally (doe-) doesn't have time to to do all (%hesitation%) all activities or assignments that you you must you must you must do it
SI12BD-00041-P30017 1 SI12BD-00041 43.75 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and my opinion (%hesitation%) i think that is is is good (%hesitation%) to look at a balance with those
SI12BD-00041-P40018 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 12.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if you travelling by airplane first of all you make to travel to airport and then (%hesitation%) to do a check in with a with a receptionist
SI12BD-00041-P40018 1 SI12BD-00041 12.27 26.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and and also (%hesitation%) you could you could you you must to to to provide your your documents to a security (%hesitation%) security personnel

SI12BD-00041-P40018 1 SI12BD-00041 44.25 46.01 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you board

SI12BD-00041-P50021 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 16.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) well the skills as develop to the as a student and maybe involves (%hesitation%) a great understanding other points of view and other (%hesitation%) kinds of minds
SI12BD-00041-P50021 1 SI12BD-00041 16.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's important to understand the project
SI12BD-00041-P50022 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 6.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that dependent on the the the kind of each each person
SI12BD-00041-P50022 1 SI12BD-00041 6.56 20.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for me is better (%hesitation%) to learn alone because (%hesitation%) i think that more i concentrate more but attending lectures that helps so much (%hesitation%) other people
SI12BD-00041-P50023 1 SI12BD-00041 0.00 20.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important because (%hesitation%) you in in you stay in a place where you (%hesitation%) feel very comfortable is very easy to learn and and improve every day in the field that you want improve
SI12BD-00042-P10005 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 10.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have actually a deep interest in learn about other countries because i believe is it's a good way to improve and develop our knowledge
SI12BD-00042-P10005 1 SI12BD-00042 10.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in addition if you travel around the world you will be able to recognise so many kind of cultures and
SI12BD-00042-P10006 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 11.70 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't have so much spare time but from time to time i like to go running on the street and also at the woods
SI12BD-00042-P10006 1 SI12BD-00042 11.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i love drawing and investigating about different disease that can cause (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00042-P10007 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my in my opinion one of the best ways to improve our english is watching films or tv series in english with spanish subtitles because it's a good way to know how to spell correctly the words and to
SI12BD-00042-P10008 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 6.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would love to know how to play an instrument for example piano or violin
SI12BD-00042-P10008 1 SI12BD-00042 6.95 18.31 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think it's so difficult but no pain no gain so i probably start (%hesitation%) learning about music and about the basics
SI12BD-00042-P10008 1 SI12BD-00042 18.31 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and then i will go
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 5.08 <o,Q4,B1,P3> going to university it's for itself a complicated decision
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 5.08 14.08 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so having a part time job could bring (%hesitation%) the same benefit and the same disdvantage at the same time
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 14.08 21.17 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first of all we are going compare the advantage and the disadvantage of having this this kind of job
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 21.17 43.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> firstly we have to know that university is complicated so we have to have the enough time to do our homework hang with friends and have the freedom of going out and spending some time with your classmates and of course you have to study for your for your exams
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 43.31 54.58 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so having a part time job could waste your time and maybe you don't you are you aren't able (%hesitation%) study enough
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 54.58 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> on the other side having this kind of job could make you earn some money
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 3.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> welcome ladies and gentlemans to my presentation
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 3.86 6.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today we are going to talk about acid rain
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 6.52 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to to find a way of of eliminate it
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 17.35 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 21.38 30.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this pollution usually (%hesitation%) create acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 30.92 39.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles could be carried by wind and could also mix in the clouds with water
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 39.33 56.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if this happen (%hesitation%) then acid rain is going to to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of of the farmers for example
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 56.58 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> of course it could also come
SI12BD-00042-P50019 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 11.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for all those people that want to develop eating healthy habits i would say them that they have to have a strong willpower for achieve they objective
SI12BD-00042-P50019 1 SI12BD-00042 11.69 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if they have a never say die attitude i'm sure they going to have a healthy life
SI12BD-00042-P50020 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 11.68 <o,Q4,B2,P5> drinking water extremely important for the human being because we are created and we are made of a highly percentage of water
SI12BD-00042-P50020 1 SI12BD-00042 11.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we have to keep hydratated to avoid any health issues and other kind of (pro-)
SI12BD-00042-P50021 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 5.92 <o,Q4,B2,P5> from my point of view doing exercise is so important in our daily life
SI12BD-00042-P50021 1 SI12BD-00042 5.92 15.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course if we are so busy we can just sleep the exercise and do the next day
SI12BD-00042-P50021 1 SI12BD-00042 15.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but at the weekend we have to do at least four days a week (so-)
SI12BD-00042-P50022 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 5.31 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the study shows that human has to sleep at least eight hours a day
SI12BD-00042-P50022 1 SI12BD-00042 5.31 15.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) i'm completely agree with this affirmation because we have to be healthy also in our sleep
SI12BD-00042-P50022 1 SI12BD-00042 15.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and this is (%hesitation%) one of the main things that
SI12BD-00042-P50023 1 SI12BD-00042 0.00 1.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends
SI12BD-00042-P50023 1 SI12BD-00042 1.26 7.68 <o,Q4,B2,P5> technology could have a bad or a good effect effect or an advantage a disadvantage
SI12BD-00042-P50023 1 SI12BD-00042 7.68 10.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it all depends on the way we use this technology
SI12BD-00042-P50023 1 SI12BD-00042 10.75 17.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if we are so atached to this technology (%hesitation%) we can develop an addiction
SI12BD-00042-P50023 1 SI12BD-00042 17.02 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and this is a really bad problem
SI12BD-00062-P10005 1 SI12BD-00062 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i live in a small town that they have a lot of mountain in the near and it's localizated in basque country near the sea if north of of spain
SI12BD-00062-P10006 1 SI12BD-00062 0.00 7.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> when i i'm holiday i i like enjoy visiting different place
SI12BD-00062-P10006 1 SI12BD-00062 7.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i like (%hesitation%) know different place because i think it's very interesting meeting different place
SI12BD-00062-P10007 1 SI12BD-00062 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> when i meet with my family we'd we like (pl-) playing different games for example (%hesitation%) table games or i will like speaking in different situation

SI12BD-00062-P30017 1 SI12BD-00062 0.00 16.74 <o,Q4,B1,P3> is true that is very important that the student should get job to pay for their university studies because they have (%hesitation%) a possibly to to independence and no depend of the parents' economic

SI12BD-00062-P30017 1 SI12BD-00062 22.01 33.02 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and if they need money to pay their university it's important that they parents help their
SI12BD-00062-P30017 1 SI12BD-00062 33.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's a good idea that the different students working and they they won a lot of money to pay their studies
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 0.00 8.63 <o,Q4,B1,P4> now i explain about what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 8.63 17.43 <o,Q4,B1,P4> in this imaging you see about these conditions
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 17.43 24.78 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the first is important travel to airport we if you do in your town
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 24.78 37.58 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then then when you wait when you go to airport you need check in your suitcase
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 37.58 45.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you you need pass to document control and you need pass to security control
SI12BD-00062-P40018 1 SI12BD-00062 45.10 52.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then if you if you have more time you wait in the in the bar or in the cafe

SI12BD-00089-P10008 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 6.46 <o,Q4,C,P1> i don't have a city in my mind yet but i would love to travel as much as i can
SI12BD-00089-P10008 1 SI12BD-00089 6.46 9.84 <o,Q4,C,P1> and right now i haven't been to europe for a a while
SI12BD-00089-P10008 1 SI12BD-00089 9.84 16.62 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i want to go to (%hesitation%) england and greece and try a lot of places
SI12BD-00089-P10008 1 SI12BD-00089 16.62 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i want to experience a lot of places before i decide it
SI12BD-00089-P30017 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 14.63 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages of students who do the fitness class during the school day is they can have time to free time to practise their fitness and help them to build a healthy body
SI12BD-00089-P30017 1 SI12BD-00089 14.63 22.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantages for them is that they may delay the time for them to study
SI12BD-00089-P30017 1 SI12BD-00089 22.02 39.25 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) they also may distribute their attention to the fitness classes so so that they might (%hesitation%) not (%hesitation%) interesting in their academic courses anymore
SI12BD-00089-P30017 1 SI12BD-00089 39.25 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and as my opinion i think it is the (p-) the advantages are
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 5.49 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the graph is about the honey from flower to shop
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 5.49 15.51 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first step of honey is being collect by the bees nectar from flowers
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 15.51 20.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 20.80 28.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the beekeepers collect honey from beehives and add them to the bottle
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 28.56 39.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after collecting honey in a bottle there will be the truck deliver to deliver the honey to the shop
SI12BD-00089-P40018 1 SI12BD-00089 39.44 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the final step of honey is that they will be sell on the shelf
SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 5.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that first of all the most important thing is the safety of that country
SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089 5.98 12.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> after that it should be the climate of the country whether the student are suitable for it
SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089 12.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> then it should be the career path of the country where they study at afterwards to find the (c-)
SI12BD-00089-P50020 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really (%hesitation%) know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of second language country the culture is so different and it's a joy to (%hesitation%) learn (f-) in other language to know their culture by that
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well first of all the difficult must come from the (%hesitation%) influence by the culture because they were so many different habit of other countries' people
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089 13.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also the difficult may be become because of the language course
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well the fast way for a student to learn about the the local culture is to (%hesitation%) get meet (be-) become friends with some local people
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089 9.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and (%hesitation%) in that case they can learn about the culture (cultu-) culture
SI12BD-00089-P50023 1 SI12BD-00089 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that kind of idea because (%hesitation%) when you study at the other country is mostly likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents long with you and so in that case you can become more independent
SI12BD-00095-P10005 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 14.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well (%hesitation%) it's a a town (%hesitation%) nearby the sea and and the mountain like almost all the north of spain so it has a quite viable (%hesitation%) well quite variety of environment

SI12BD-00095-P10005 1 SI12BD-00095 17.99 19.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's quite quite good
SI12BD-00095-P10005 1 SI12BD-00095 19.29 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like it
SI12BD-00095-P10006 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 2.98 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well there are a number of things that i like
SI12BD-00095-P10006 1 SI12BD-00095 2.98 10.21 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that (%hesitation%) the most thing thing that i enjoy might be football may be football
SI12BD-00095-P10006 1 SI12BD-00095 10.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) yeah but i also love (%hesitation%) being culturally involved with the place that i am visiting and being with my friends having drinks for
SI12BD-00095-P10007 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 2.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well that's a tricky question
SI12BD-00095-P10007 1 SI12BD-00095 2.62 10.34 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it's difficult to answer because we are a wide family but i would say that maybe my grandmother
SI12BD-00095-P10007 1 SI12BD-00095 10.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) we used to watch television at night and this is a a good moment for for both of us because we catch up between us
SI12BD-00095-P10008 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 12.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> oh well i am doing (%hesitation%) lots of (%hesitation%) efforts for having a (%hesitation%) employment in the old house in any old house as a psychologist
SI12BD-00095-P10008 1 SI12BD-00095 12.20 14.98 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i have done psychology and ontology

SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 12.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantages is that (%hesitation%) they are going to be able to pay their (%hesitation%) students loans and this is going to give them a sense of responsibility
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 12.45 27.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i (als-) i also think that (%hesitation%) there are some disadvantages added to to it that is that (%hesitation%) the time that they are going to spend on those jobs (%hesitation%) they aren't going to be able to to use for studying
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 27.55 37.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well (%hesitation%) studying studying is (%hesitation%) very important for having a better job in the future so it could be a downbreak
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 37.92 54.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion it's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the of the future prospect that (%hesitation%) the students will have about (%hesitation%) about their future jobs
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 54.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they will have a first experience to know how it going to be
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 17.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> while it is important to arrive to the airport (%hesitation%) two hours previous to the take off (%hesitation%) it is also necessary to be well aware of the things that are allowed to pass through the control
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 17.23 29.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> for example we are not able to to go with metallic (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) gadgets or any kind of kind of white arms
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 29.54 33.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> a knife it's impossible to pass through the security control
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 33.18 42.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) as we have been two hours previous to to the take off we are going to have a quiet time a lot of time to wait
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 42.73 53.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so (%hesitation%) we can spend in the cafeteria cafeteria restaurants or any kind of gift shop that there are in the in the airport
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 53.46 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then it's just waiting to the hostess to to ask for us
SI12BD-00095-P50019 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 8.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well there are a lot of service among the learning material in the (%hesitation%) through a new technology

SI12BD-00095-P50020 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 15.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i have experiences the both sides (%hesitation%) of the both and i would say that maybe (%hesitation%) the face to face (%hesitation%) learning or school is is better than the one online
SI12BD-00095-P50020 1 SI12BD-00095 15.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) it's more comfortable
SI12BD-00095-P50021 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 17.68 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they are going to have a prospect of the future (%hesitation%) group working and they are going to achieve some some (%hesitation%) strategies to live with groups and to take (%hesitation%) well overall to listen to take others' opinion into consideration
SI12BD-00095-P50021 1 SI12BD-00095 17.68 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there are many things
SI12BD-00095-P50022 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 2.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well it depends on the persons
SI12BD-00095-P50022 1 SI12BD-00095 2.83 10.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) for me for example is better to attending to lectures because i have a firsthand opinion about it
SI12BD-00095-P50022 1 SI12BD-00095 10.44 14.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but many people just by reading something can catch everything
SI12BD-00095-P50022 1 SI12BD-00095 14.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) it really depends on the personal preference and their abilities
SI12BD-00095-P50023 1 SI12BD-00095 0.00 12.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well it's really important because (%hesitation%) of the resource that you give to the students they are going to (%hesitation%) have a more effective learning strategies and learning facilities
SI12BD-00095-P50023 1 SI12BD-00095 12.56 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so in that way they are going to have better outcome and the school is going to be better
SI12BD-00110-P10005 1 SI12BD-00110 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i'm very interested because it's very important for everyone
SI12BD-00110-P10006 1 SI12BD-00110 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i like to go swimming or ride a bike or (som-) sometimes go to walk and spending time with my family

SI12BD-00110-P40018 1 SI12BD-00110 10.04 18.52 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the bees fly to the beehives and they make (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) honey from the nectar
SI12BD-00110-P40018 1 SI12BD-00110 18.52 23.71 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it is produces in or it is collected only from beehives
SI12BD-00110-P40018 1 SI12BD-00110 23.71 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it is (%hesitation%) put into glasses and then (%hesitation%) some people carry it to the different places to sell it
SI12BD-00110-P50019 1 SI12BD-00110 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that the principal thing that they have to consider it is the (%hesitation%) prices or the coins that is going to use and where (s-) they are going to live is very important
SI12BD-00110-P50020 1 SI12BD-00110 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it is very important because it can open some doors and opportunities for the students if the students can speak two or maybe three language for their professions
SI12BD-00110-P50021 1 SI12BD-00110 0.00 11.53 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is (%hesitation%) difficult really difficult because they have to go (%hesitation%) away of their family or their houses
SI12BD-00110-P50021 1 SI12BD-00110 11.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they have to live a new kind of of life and it's very difficult
SI12BD-00113-P10005 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 8.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> now i'm living in a apartment with two bedroom and with (%hesitation%) one of my colleagues
SI12BD-00113-P10005 1 SI12BD-00113 8.86 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) it's very convenient and you know the the sight is very good at there because it's fifteen floor

SI12BD-00113-P10006 1 SI12BD-00113 15.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) you know to experience the
SI12BD-00113-P10007 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) the the my favourite family member is my nephew (%hesitation%) which who is a little girl at six years old and very active and playful and
SI12BD-00113-P10008 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 5.51 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) currently i don't have a clear view about my future

SI12BD-00113-P10008 1 SI12BD-00113 17.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> yeah
SI12BD-00113-P30017 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 27.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> well from well the advantages of (%hesitation%) student university students taking a job to offer their payment of university fees (%hesitation%) first of all they can get more familiar with the working environment after the graduation which will benefit for the job seeking or even the career development

SI12BD-00113-P30017 1 SI12BD-00113 45.09 57.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> so for my opinion (%hesitation%) the university students should take part time jobs (%hesitation%) under the regulation of the university (%hesitation%) to guarantee the study time
SI12BD-00113-P30017 1 SI12BD-00113 57.89 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) yeah
SI12BD-00113-P40018 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 6.96 <o,Q4,C,P4> the diagram shows the procedure of travelling by airplane
SI12BD-00113-P40018 1 SI12BD-00113 6.96 12.84 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) first of all (%hesitation%) you need to travel to the airport
SI12BD-00113-P40018 1 SI12BD-00113 12.84 24.25 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can choose any kind of transportation likes your private car or train or bus (%hesitation%) to arrive the airport
SI12BD-00113-P40018 1 SI12BD-00113 24.25 37.33 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you need to check in (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to the airport to the airlines and get the document of control and a board ticket
SI12BD-00113-P40018 1 SI12BD-00113 37.33 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then you have to (pa-) hand out the document to the security to pass the security check and wait (%hesitation%) until it's time until the boarding time to you know (%hesitation%) get on the plane
SI12BD-00113-P50019 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 5.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there are several ways for students to use technologies in their study
SI12BD-00113-P50019 1 SI12BD-00113 5.97 12.12 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) the most important one is (%hesitation%) the search engine (%hesitation%) likes google
SI12BD-00113-P50019 1 SI12BD-00113 12.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can search the (%hesitation%) materials that they wants of any kind from the internet and use them
SI12BD-00113-P50020 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 3.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i agree with this idea
SI12BD-00113-P50020 1 SI12BD-00113 3.00 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) the face to face teaching is not just involves the transfer of the information but also transfer the expressions and the emotions as well which benefits which will indicate students (%hesitation%) which part is
SI12BD-00113-P50021 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in the group project (%hesitation%) the most important thing they can obtain is the group cooperation with other people which wel will be very important in the working environment because (%hesitation%) most of us will work in a company
SI12BD-00113-P50022 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 12.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well yes i think (%hesitation%) attending a lecture is very important because if you study alone (%hesitation%) it's very it's a big challenge to your self discipline
SI12BD-00113-P50022 1 SI12BD-00113 12.49 17.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if you attend a lecture the teacher will control your study
SI12BD-00113-P50022 1 SI12BD-00113 17.38 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) you know (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00113-P50023 1 SI12BD-00113 0.00 7.33 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think the (%hesitation%) learning facilities is very important in the in the university
SI12BD-00113-P50023 1 SI12BD-00113 7.33 20.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it's very necessary to supply the classrooms (%hesitation%) the the internet access to the students (%hesitation%) and you know access to the
SI12BD-00125-P10005 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i think that the environment is very important for our lives because without environment there isn't life
SI12BD-00125-P10006 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 6.26 <o,Q5,A2,P1> in my free time i enjoy with my friends

SI12BD-00125-P10008 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> in the future i would life in a new house a new house with garden and swimming pool with a lot of (%hesitation%) rooms and (sha-)
SI12BD-00125-P30017 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 19.84 <o,Q5,A2,P3> i am happy to talk about this topic because for me is very important the (fist-) the fitness classes because (%hesitation%) are very important for a healthy life
SI12BD-00125-P30017 1 SI12BD-00125 19.84 33.03 <o,Q5,A2,P3> because i should (%hesitation%) i think that or all are all are the advantage
SI12BD-00125-P30017 1 SI12BD-00125 33.03 41.73 <o,Q5,A2,P3> school and (sch-) schools and college should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI12BD-00125-P30017 1 SI12BD-00125 41.73 60.00 <o,Q5,A2,P3> in in my opinion is a very important (%hesitation%) to do fitness classes because (%hesitation%) you will be strong and more intelligent
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 10.22 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i go to speak about honey from flower to shop
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 10.22 17.07 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 17.07 26.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) next bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 26.51 37.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) later beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put the honey in bottles
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 37.91 48.78 <o,Q4,B1,P4> next the (beek-) the beekeepers (%hesitation%) put the bottles in the vehicle
SI12BD-00125-P40018 1 SI12BD-00125 48.78 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) get
SI12BD-00125-P50019 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think that is very important studying in other in another country because you will learn their language and other culture
SI12BD-00125-P50020 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> studying in a second language it's a good point because i learn other language for become a new job
SI12BD-00125-P50021 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think that the more difficulty of studying in another country is learn other language
SI12BD-00125-P50022 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 12.01 <o,Q5,A2,P5> when you study in a other country you learn a local (cul-) culture
SI12BD-00125-P50022 1 SI12BD-00125 12.01 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> and the you know about other (ga-)
SI12BD-00125-P50023 1 SI12BD-00125 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> living in another country it will the person be (%hesitation%) more independent
SI12BD-00135-P10005 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 5.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm deeply interested in learning about other countries
SI12BD-00135-P10005 1 SI12BD-00135 5.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and my two favorite things to learn about them it's (%hesitation%) try its food and also learn something words from your language
SI12BD-00135-P10006 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoyed relaxing in my house so i spend my free time here in my house watching movies or some tv shows and eating popcorns or (%hesitation%) drinking coffee or something like that
SI12BD-00135-P10007 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 9.83 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that the best way to improve my english is through immersion i mean going to a country where english is spoken
SI12BD-00135-P10007 1 SI12BD-00135 9.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but the second better best way to learn about english is watching tv shows in english and listening to music in english
SI12BD-00135-P10008 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 2.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that it will be cooking
SI12BD-00135-P10008 1 SI12BD-00135 2.69 9.64 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i mean right now i don't enjoy it because i think that i don't know how to do it correctly
SI12BD-00135-P10008 1 SI12BD-00135 9.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i i imagine that if i tried to learn how to do it taster and easier it could be a great advance for me
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 6.26 <o,Q4,C,P3> okay i find some advantages in working and a student at the same time
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 6.26 13.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> some of them are that you can practice what you learn in the schools when you are working
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 13.00 16.30 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you gain experience in the area
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 16.30 25.53 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you also start to know people who's working in this area and you can build some networking in in the field
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 25.53 38.48 <o,Q4,C,P3> well i also think that it has disadvantages coz (%hesitation%) working and studying requires time and is a huge responsibility which could be so stressful
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 38.48 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> at the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because at the end it (%hesitation%) has a positive impact in your experience and it could help you to find a job
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 3.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today we're gonna talk about acid rain
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 3.21 6.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is caused by pollution
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 6.82 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this pollution is principle principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we're talking about smoke
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 15.70 24.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this smoke (%hesitation%) has some acid particles and these acid particles are carried by wind
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 24.24 45.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in this (%hesitation%) travel some acid particles can be (%hesitation%) falling but as dust and other acid particles mix with clouds of water and then they are precipitated in form of water i mean rain or in form (s-) of snow
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 45.70 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this (%hesitation%) acid rain is toxic so it has severe damages to our environment because not only (dam-) damage (%hesitation%) our plants but also microorganisms in our soil
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 7.10 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my advice to this people is that they plan their meals
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135 7.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it could (%hesitation%) help you to be prepare when you have hungry and not full in this junk food that you can find in the streets
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 4.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's difficult to determine how much is a lot
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135 4.30 10.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but the recommendation is that you should drink at least two liters of water every day
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135 10.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's what our body needs to maintain hydratation
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 1.72 <o,Q4,B2,P5> absolutely
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 1.72 6.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion is vital to do exercise every day
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 6.69 11.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 11.71 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> this can improve our health in a good way
SI12BD-00135-P50022 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 3.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that each body is different
SI12BD-00135-P50022 1 SI12BD-00135 3.48 13.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) some someone can just need six hours of the sleeping and another bodies can need nine hours of sleeping
SI12BD-00135-P50022 1 SI12BD-00135 13.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the important thing is that having a habit in these hours because is the space that we can (re-)
SI12BD-00135-P50023 1 SI12BD-00135 0.00 2.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it can have both
SI12BD-00135-P50023 1 SI12BD-00135 2.83 12.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for one side we can have all these apps and programs that are useful to track our habits of exercise or (ea-) eating
SI12BD-00135-P50023 1 SI12BD-00135 12.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00150-P10005 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about others countries can have a deeper insight into other cultures and and be ex broaden my horizons
SI12BD-00150-P10006 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending my free time by reading learn reading books re (%hesitation%) watching movies watching drama series and have have an out with my friends
SI12BD-00150-P10007 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> as for improve improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 9.88 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it could be y cooking because cooking is a important skill for independent life
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150 9.88 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and and through cooking i can't i can make delicious meals for my families to spread happiness and well being
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 21.38 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think the advantages are students can get more practical skills and and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 21.38 33.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class and leading to their their poor grades
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 33.61 40.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and study
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 40.17 60.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and students should should make should make the the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves so because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollution given off from factories and the vehicles contain contains smoke which acid particles are in
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 17.35 21.61 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they are carried by the wind
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 21.61 39.19 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of them fall as dust but and others and others mix with cloud water to to form rain or snow which is also called acid rain
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 39.19 60.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this can and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has (rai-) which has raised people's awareness of it
SI12BD-00150-P50019 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 9.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is persistence and self discipline
SI12BD-00150-P50019 1 SI12BD-00150 9.66 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by doing so you can you can keep fit and reach your goals someday
SI12BD-00150-P50020 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> drinking a lot of water is beneficial to your skin health as well as quicken your inner body movements and and promote your circulation
SI12BD-00150-P50021 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think making it a routine for you to do exercise is not only good for your health but can make can help you form some good habits and your qualities
SI12BD-00150-P50022 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 3.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i'm in favour of it
SI12BD-00150-P50022 1 SI12BD-00150 3.35 20.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> enough sleep enough sleep can refresh your mind after a busy day and get you well prepared for the next day but sleeping deprivation can make you stressed next day
SI12BD-00150-P50023 1 SI12BD-00150 0.00 20.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's positive because using applications such as such as keep to do exercise can make it a routine for us to do exercise and we can have a sense of achievement by looking at our progress
SI12BD-00162-P10005 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 13.13 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i very interesting in other countries because i really like other cultures and i like visit them
SI12BD-00162-P10005 1 SI12BD-00162 13.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> also i think that this is very important for you
SI12BD-00162-P10006 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 7.12 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my free time i really like go to the nature
SI12BD-00162-P10006 1 SI12BD-00162 7.12 16.39 <o,Q5,B1,P1> sometimes i go to the park and see the birds of the sky
SI12BD-00162-P10006 1 SI12BD-00162 16.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i really like relax
SI12BD-00162-P10007 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 13.49 <o,Q5,B1,P1> this is a controversial question because i think that exist a lot of methods for learn english
SI12BD-00162-P10007 1 SI12BD-00162 13.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but the most important i think it is the
SI12BD-00162-P10008 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe if i can learn one skill this (%hesitation%) should be learnt a lot of language because i really like other language
SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 21.60 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that this is a controversial topic because it have a lot of advantage and also it has (disadvan-) (dis-) disadvantage
SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 21.60 45.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example (%hesitation%) you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend study if you want passed the exam of the university
SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 45.61 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for the reason i think that it's better if you don't work while you are studying but if you need the money you should work
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about acid rains
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 6.12 15.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in this picture we can see the water cycle
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 15.46 31.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all we can see like factories and vehicles made pollution and this pollution (%hesitation%) is in the air
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 31.81 38.58 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and it's felled on this
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 38.58 49.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> next (%hesitation%) we can see the acid particles are smoke and acid particles are carried by wind
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162 49.61 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this wind (%hesitation%) for one hand it's in the cloud water and then some acid particles fall as
SI12BD-00162-P50019 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 11.69 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you want eating (%hesitation%) good habits i think that you need (%hesitation%) cook your food
SI12BD-00162-P50019 1 SI12BD-00162 11.69 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you mustn't (%hesitation%) buy fast food or other thing
SI12BD-00162-P50020 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's very important that you drink a lot of water because your body it's formed for eighty percent of water and you need this for live well
SI12BD-00162-P50021 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's not necessary doing exercise every day of the week but if you want stay good with your body i recommend you that you do two times a week exercise
SI12BD-00162-P50022 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 12.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's very important that you sleep very well and eight hours (%hesitation%) for day
SI12BD-00162-P50022 1 SI12BD-00162 12.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but if you can't one day it's not important
SI12BD-00162-P50023 1 SI12BD-00162 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's a controversial topic because in general i think that the technology it's a good invention but it's true that the technology produce a lot of stress in a lot of people
SI12BD-00164-P10005 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's well know that the environment need to be healthy for our future and keep the nature in a healthy way be and try to stop the pollution and contamination of the environment
SI12BD-00164-P10006 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> my friends and me would like to spend the time going to the cinema going to restaurants or sometime when i hosted a dinner for them and we start to talk about our families our goals and catch up with them
SI12BD-00164-P10007 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 13.35 <o,Q3,B1,P1> in my point of view the most similar at me is my mother because she has the same love of for music classic music and orchestral music
SI12BD-00164-P10007 1 SI12BD-00164 13.35 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P1> so we sometime spend time to listen that kind of music and we enjoy too much
SI12BD-00164-P10008 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 15.90 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in the future i see myself living in dubai because is a lovely city with an amazing (%hesitation%) structures and amazing people amazing music
SI12BD-00164-P10008 1 SI12BD-00164 15.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it has always been my dream to live there
SI12BD-00164-P30017 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 8.46 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in nowaday it's very important to know the advantages and disadvantages about the exercises
SI12BD-00164-P30017 1 SI12BD-00164 8.46 27.88 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for example wa in one hand i can mention one advantages of the fitness classes would be that the system of a school and college (sh-) teach of the students how to start a healthy life and include in their routines
SI12BD-00164-P30017 1 SI12BD-00164 27.88 41.84 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in other hand one of disadvantages will be that time they spending on fitness classes it will be used for bree for feeding they brain
SI12BD-00164-P30017 1 SI12BD-00164 41.84 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in from my point of view it's very important the school and college just take one day of that time to show the students how to start a healthy with a balance of fitness in your body and your brain
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 3.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> hello good morning
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 3.00 6.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> today i'm going to explain you how honey is produced
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 6.59 9.97 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all every start with bees
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 9.97 17.81 <o,Q4,B1,P4> bees collect the nectar from flowers and secondly the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 17.81 32.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> third the beekeepers collect that honey from beehives and keep that honey into the good designed (%hesitation%) honey bottles
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 32.02 41.13 <o,Q4,B1,P4> that honey bottles are organized and then distribuate for the company
SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 41.13 48.56 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the company provide this honey to supermarkets small shops

SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 57.62 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> thank you
SI12BD-00164-P50019 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 8.91 <o,Q3,B1,P5> my point of view they will considerate the economics of the country they want to study
SI12BD-00164-P50019 1 SI12BD-00164 8.91 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> because it's very important to pay the university so choose the country it will be that good economics and good culture about the immigrant
SI12BD-00164-P50020 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> in my opinion the advantages of studying in second languages will be that you can improve that language so that you can learn more about the language and start to talk (%hesitation%) with other people and get good curriculum for that
SI12BD-00164-P50021 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 10.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my experience the most difficult to study in other country is you are so far from your family
SI12BD-00164-P50021 1 SI12BD-00164 10.22 18.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> you need to start over because you have no friends there so that means make more friends new friends and new people
SI12BD-00164-P50021 1 SI12BD-00164 18.94 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so that must be
SI12BD-00164-P50022 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> in my experience the best way to know more about the local culture it's integrate of they festivities and walking around the city go to the small markets so you can get more interesting about the local culture
SI12BD-00164-P50023 1 SI12BD-00164 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> personally i would say that it really helps to become independent because be far away of your parents teach you how to keep a home how to cook how to make money and other skills

SI12BD-00191-P40018 1 SI12BD-00191 34.42 39.03 <o,Q4,B1,P4> than they arrive at supermarkets

SI12BD-00191-P50019 1 SI12BD-00191 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that a student choosing another country because they (%hesitation%) have (%hesitation%) they learn (%hesitation%) the language before and (%hesitation%) in the future they will meet other people

SI12BD-00191-P50021 1 SI12BD-00191 15.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it's difficult studying a second language

SI12BD-00191-P50023 1 SI12BD-00191 0.00 10.62 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with you because the student is becoming independent when they live in (an-) another country
SI12BD-00191-P50023 1 SI12BD-00191 10.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) he or she be able to independent when he cooking or cleaning the flat

SI12BD-00201-P30017 1 SI12BD-00201 0.00 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion i think it's a great option a great idea only if you have the time and the school allows it because these activities are very difficult
SI12BD-00201-P30017 1 SI12BD-00201 15.49 38.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think the the part time jobs (%hesitation%) have a lot of advantage and maybe you have the enough money to go out with your friends go to the parties (%hesitation%) go to the movies or cinemas and maybe you can pay your gym
SI12BD-00201-P30017 1 SI12BD-00201 38.92 57.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) this have a lot of disadvantage because you don't have enough time to do your homework to pay attention of your classes and you don't have the time to study your for your exams
SI12BD-00201-P30017 1 SI12BD-00201 57.17 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think it's very difficult

SI12BD-00201-P40018 1 SI12BD-00201 21.06 28.51 <o,Q4,B2,P4> two acid particles are in the smoke and then these particles goes to the sky
SI12BD-00201-P40018 1 SI12BD-00201 28.51 35.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and in the third pass third step acid particles are carried by wind

SI12BD-00201-P40018 1 SI12BD-00201 47.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the final step (%hesitation%) six acid particles are in rain or snow and this damage (th-) to environment
SI12BD-00201-P50019 1 SI12BD-00201 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> what i do advise is that they drink a lot of water and about food always eat everything balanced without leaving out any type of protein vegetables or any cereal
SI12BD-00201-P50020 1 SI12BD-00201 0.00 11.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in addition to hydrating you (%hesitation%) we need water because our body needs a lot of water to perform various functions
SI12BD-00201-P50020 1 SI12BD-00201 11.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example blood contains a lot of water and that water carries oxygen throughout our body to the cells
SI12BD-00201-P50021 1 SI12BD-00201 0.00 17.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> not every day but it's very important (%hesitation%) that you do a lot of exercise because it's healthy and (y-) your body needs this exercise to to be healthy

SI12BD-00201-P50022 1 SI12BD-00201 6.97 11.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if you sleep a little more it will not affect much

SI12BD-00201-P50023 1 SI12BD-00201 8.93 14.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if you know how to use technology it can help you to be healthier

SI12BD-00267-P30017 1 SI12BD-00267 0.00 12.41 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion advantage that could have work is that you can pay your own things

SI12BD-00267-P50019 1 SI12BD-00267 0.00 19.68 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the students can use the new technologies to study best (%hesitation%) using computer using mobile phones because they can consult everything in his mobiles
SI12BD-00267-P50019 1 SI12BD-00267 19.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and
SI12BD-00267-P50020 1 SI12BD-00267 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that is the best because the teacher explain you everything best that if you only read in a paper or a computer the teacher can explain and show how are the things
SI12BD-00267-P50021 1 SI12BD-00267 0.00 11.28 <o,Q5,B1,P5> work in group in group projects can be a good solution to do best things
SI12BD-00267-P50021 1 SI12BD-00267 11.28 17.22 <o,Q5,B1,P5> every every people can learn you to do new things

SI12BD-00267-P50023 1 SI12BD-00267 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> to (uni-) the university (%hesitation%) have to try that every student learn well and do his course well
SI12BD-00268-P10005 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 10.74 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm very interested in environment such as for example i'm i am very (cu-) curious about (sci-) environmental problem
SI12BD-00268-P10005 1 SI12BD-00268 10.74 18.04 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so to makes the sustain of the world is a basic problem for us
SI12BD-00268-P10005 1 SI12BD-00268 18.04 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so it is a very important

SI12BD-00268-P10006 1 SI12BD-00268 16.95 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so it is (e-) essential for me
SI12BD-00268-P10007 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 3.36 <o,Q4,B1,P1> my brother is more similar to me
SI12BD-00268-P10007 1 SI12BD-00268 3.36 6.24 <o,Q4,B1,P1> he has the two common point with me
SI12BD-00268-P10007 1 SI12BD-00268 6.24 16.12 <o,Q4,B1,P1> he is gentle and make a joke make a joke often in daily lifes but he's not good at studying
SI12BD-00268-P10007 1 SI12BD-00268 16.12 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P1> on the other hand i am very interested in
SI12BD-00268-P10008 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 18.68 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in the future i like to live in luxury luxury houses very famous sightseeing and a castle but there is a lot of mysterious place that cannot be known by media
SI12BD-00268-P10008 1 SI12BD-00268 18.68 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i like to (pl-)
SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 8.48 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i agree with the school and college should make time to in school day for all student to do fitness classes
SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 8.48 10.62 <o,Q3,B1,P3> there is (%hesitation%) two reasons
SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 10.62 18.12 <o,Q3,B1,P3> thanks to the fitness in classes student can keep later hours and (%hesitation%) keep (%hesitation%) your health
SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 18.12 29.98 <o,Q3,B1,P3> so if they do do not have keep if they if they do not (%hesitation%) exercise they will be get on weight and will become sick in the future

SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 42.12 46.47 <o,Q3,B1,P3> they can concentrate on studying for a school short time
SI12BD-00268-P30017 1 SI12BD-00268 46.47 52.31 <o,Q3,B1,P3> so it is good for a school to take a fitness class

SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 3.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> hi
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 3.80 8.76 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i am going to explain the how honey from flower to the shop
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 8.76 11.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first bees collect nectar from flowers
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 11.92 15.11 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and that is bring back to them their nest
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 15.11 19.90 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) in their nest there are a lot of honey in the nest
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 19.90 23.61 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and second beekeepers collect honey from the beehives
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 23.61 30.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> it is a dangerous work but it's essential for the honey bee honey company
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 30.70 39.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then in the factory honey was put into the bottle and that is sending to the truck
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 39.92 48.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and truck transports the bottle to the store at (%hesitation%) any place
SI12BD-00268-P40018 1 SI12BD-00268 48.16 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and at the store honey bottle was selled by the keeper and that customer can get the honey at the store
SI12BD-00268-P50019 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 11.59 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when student choose a country to study abroad first they should think about how to study and what is the aim of study
SI12BD-00268-P50019 1 SI12BD-00268 11.59 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so to think about that it is they can choose the country that is the best for study
SI12BD-00268-P50020 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 9.81 <o,Q4,B1,P5> thanks to studying in a second language they can compare the mother language and english and second language
SI12BD-00268-P50020 1 SI12BD-00268 9.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so by studying the multiple language they can acquire the good study of argh
SI12BD-00268-P50021 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 9.96 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when they study in another country they may be crush into the difficulty of the culture
SI12BD-00268-P50021 1 SI12BD-00268 9.96 12.86 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so other country have the another culture
SI12BD-00268-P50021 1 SI12BD-00268 12.86 20.03 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so they have difficulty in understanding with each other and other student
SI12BD-00268-P50022 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 14.93 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when they study abroad they can learn the local culture and acquire language by practicing the club activity or visit is a local house
SI12BD-00268-P50022 1 SI12BD-00268 14.93 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so they can communicate with a lot of people in another country
SI12BD-00268-P50023 1 SI12BD-00268 0.00 13.29 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i partly agree with that opinion that student can become a independent because (o-) thank to their studying abroad but without the independence aim
SI12BD-00268-P50023 1 SI12BD-00268 13.29 16.24 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's not difficult to become independent
SI12BD-00268-P50023 1 SI12BD-00268 16.24 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so that is the aim of them
SI12BD-00292-P10005 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 1.83 <o,Q4,B1,P1> of course
SI12BD-00292-P10005 1 SI12BD-00292 1.83 15.68 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i live (%hesitation%) in a flat near to the coast and we have the sea (%hesitation%) at five minutes approximately
SI12BD-00292-P10005 1 SI12BD-00292 15.68 20.28 <o,Q4,B1,P1> we live in a flat with another neighbours
SI12BD-00292-P10006 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 12.19 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy visiting other (%hesitation%) museums and monuments
SI12BD-00292-P10006 1 SI12BD-00292 12.19 20.63 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and also (%hesitation%) visiting bars and meeting with other people meet other
SI12BD-00292-P10007 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 20.80 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy (%hesitation%) spending time with my (grand-) granddad because (%hesitation%) when i was child child i go with him everywhere
SI12BD-00292-P10008 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 18.74 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like to be a professional (%hesitation%) psychologist and work in an hospital with (%hesitation%) patients with mental health
SI12BD-00292-P10008 1 SI12BD-00292 18.74 20.28 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 7.37 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) well there are many advantages but also there are disadvantages
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 7.37 29.20 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example the advantages are that (%hesitation%) the students (%hesitation%) who (%hesitation%) work know the effort that (%hesitation%) that do (%hesitation%) pay their universities and this is a positive point
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 29.20 44.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but (%hesitation%) disadvantages for example is that (%hesitation%) they can't dedicate all the time to study and their marks can be (%hesitation%) worst
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 44.23 49.46 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in mine opinion (%hesitation%) it depends on the person
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 49.46 56.18 <o,Q5,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) for example a person it's good but (%hesitation%) another person it's bad
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 56.18 60.72 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think this
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 10.12 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well travelling bl by plane you have to travel to the airport
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 10.12 14.72 <o,Q5,B1,P4> you can go by bus by car or by train
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 14.72 20.45 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then (%hesitation%) when you are in the airport you have to do the check in
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 20.45 32.74 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the check in you have to give your passport and an assistant staff (%hesitation%) make the make the issue
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 32.74 39.32 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then you have to go to the document control then the security
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 39.32 52.95 <o,Q5,B1,P4> wait for the plane because it it is recommended to stay two hours after the the the (pl-) the the depart
SI12BD-00292-P40018 1 SI12BD-00292 52.95 60.21 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then when the informations take you have to board the plane
SI12BD-00292-P50019 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 6.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> nowadays we have technology to support our studies
SI12BD-00292-P50019 1 SI12BD-00292 6.82 20.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) then this (%hesitation%) very useful because you can use (%hesitation%) cards to memorise the concepts and also to do exams by internet
SI12BD-00292-P50020 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 20.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i believe that learning face to face is better because (%hesitation%) you can (%hesitation%) practise in the real situation to speak to (%hesitation%) read and communication verbal and
SI12BD-00292-P50021 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 8.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in fact there are many many (%hesitation%) positive thing
SI12BD-00292-P50021 1 SI12BD-00292 8.85 20.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can learn to (%hesitation%) work in group to (%hesitation%) understand the other
SI12BD-00292-P50022 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 17.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think attending lectures is better because you have another opinion you can ask for some doubts and you have (%hesitation%) different options
SI12BD-00292-P50022 1 SI12BD-00292 17.52 20.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> instead
SI12BD-00292-P50023 1 SI12BD-00292 0.00 20.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well nowadays we are living the media age and i think it's positive to have a lot of (%hesitation%) forms to improve and learn (%hesitation%) things about the university
SI12BD-00314-P10005 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 2.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite time of year was summer
SI12BD-00314-P10005 1 SI12BD-00314 2.96 11.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy this epoch of the year because you enjoy outside

SI12BD-00314-P10006 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 4.17 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is important to me to read and listen the new
SI12BD-00314-P10006 1 SI12BD-00314 4.17 14.80 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but in sometimes the news are not are not good because there are a lot of of problems in the world or a lot of bad news
SI12BD-00314-P10006 1 SI12BD-00314 14.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i prefer to not read and listen the the news
SI12BD-00314-P10007 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 14.24 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i was child i spent my free time with my friends in the park to (%hesitation%) we are playing played (%hesitation%) some games

SI12BD-00314-P30017 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 18.23 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i think it is important the all university courses should include a period of of practical work experience because there are a lots of advantage like you improve in your personal life and in the in your personal job
SI12BD-00314-P30017 1 SI12BD-00314 18.23 23.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion there there are no disadvantage for this
SI12BD-00314-P30017 1 SI12BD-00314 23.30 32.11 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) well maybe you don't have more time more free time or to do another things
SI12BD-00314-P30017 1 SI12BD-00314 32.11 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and well in my own opinion i think it is important to the students take practical works experience during the courses of university
SI12BD-00314-P40018 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 17.42 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well this graph this line graph shows the visit to the three new online pop music site about last week about the during their first week

SI12BD-00314-P40018 1 SI12BD-00314 30.81 51.02 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the music now is the most popular online pop site because they increase the sixty people thousand of people to one hundred people and maintain this for the next days
SI12BD-00314-P40018 1 SI12BD-00314 51.02 54.55 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the songs for you is not very popular
SI12BD-00314-P40018 1 SI12BD-00314 54.55 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so as you can see in the graphic this is the sixty percent no sixty
SI12BD-00314-P50019 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well i think that the kind of person to do a good team leader is that have (lo-) that has

SI12BD-00314-P50022 1 SI12BD-00314 5.40 16.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i recommend to do to face to face teams because is more efficient with the people see each other in person
SI12BD-00314-P50022 1 SI12BD-00314 16.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and is
SI12BD-00314-P50023 1 SI12BD-00314 0.00 11.63 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well in my opinion i think is better to work when a with a team to more their results than alone
SI12BD-00314-P50023 1 SI12BD-00314 11.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because if you have with another people you have more ideas and more positive result than (a-)

SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 8.46 14.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> but is difficult because (%hesitation%) this have advantage and disadvantage
SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 14.28 27.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example (%hesitation%) one advantage could be they have money for shop (%hesitation%) their own things and they can spend (%hesitation%) the money (%hesitation%) in her her things
SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 27.55 30.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> but (%hesitation%) have a disadvantage also
SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 30.53 43.40 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) have to combine the job and study and now (%hesitation%) and in some cases or is very difficult to combine these

SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 50.47 54.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> and my own opinion is difficult (%hesitation%) to combine these
SI12BD-00324-P30017 1 SI12BD-00324 54.45 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i don't know if is a good idea (%hesitation%) for spend your

SI12BD-00372-P40018 1 SI12BD-00372 22.25 36.20 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust and they (%hesitation%) come to the earth

SI12BD-00376-P30017 1 SI12BD-00376 30.46 56.36 <o,Q4,A2,P3> and (%hesitation%) advantage he wast (%hesitation%) (h-) sorry he have (%hesitation%) money for this things and this (cap-) (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) caprised (%hesitation%) in your (ri-) in your life sorry
SI12BD-00376-P30017 1 SI12BD-00376 56.36 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P3> this is my opinion
SI12BD-00376-P40018 1 SI12BD-00376 0.00 14.85 <o,Q4,A2,P4> to (tra-) to travel to by plane first you go to the airport and (%hesitation%) check in
SI12BD-00376-P40018 1 SI12BD-00376 14.85 46.94 <o,Q4,A2,P4> and you must (%hesitation%) have a document control and (%hesitation%) security and (%hesitation%) you can't wait (%hesitation%) when your (%hesitation%) wait (%hesitation%) eating in the airport when the avion (%hesitation%) it is in the airport
SI12BD-00376-P40018 1 SI12BD-00376 46.94 60.04 <o,Q4,A2,P4> it is (%hesitation%) very very important that you have a document controls because it is necessary
SI12BD-00376-P50019 1 SI12BD-00376 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> the technology it's very very important for the student because (%hesitation%) now in this times everybody use the technology for looking for (%hesitation%) questions
SI12BD-00376-P50020 1 SI12BD-00376 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think it is very good because the student they are ask all the questions that he they are now in this momment
SI12BD-00376-P50021 1 SI12BD-00376 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> group projects it's very good for another students because interview (%hesitation%) opinions in another company (%hesitation%) of (%hesitation%) friends on another class
SI12BD-00376-P50023 1 SI12BD-00376 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> in my in my opinion yes of course it's very very very very important that they they must (%hesitation%) conditiona (%hesitation%) conditionic (%hesitation%) good
SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 7.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite time is autumn because autumn is a very comfortable season
SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398 7.20 12.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in this season is not very hot or very cold
SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398 12.12 15.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the temperature is suitable to life
SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398 15.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) the fruits is very delicious in autumn
SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 4.81 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think read news every day is very important
SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398 4.81 10.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we need to understand what happens in our surrounding every day
SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398 10.75 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) it's a most important that we can prepare everything in advance
SI12BD-00398-P10007 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 7.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i was child i wouldn't have many work or study need i to do is
SI12BD-00398-P10007 1 SI12BD-00398 7.78 10.34 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i just need to have fun
SI12BD-00398-P10007 1 SI12BD-00398 10.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00398-P10008 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 5.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my master degree is environment management
SI12BD-00398-P10008 1 SI12BD-00398 5.25 10.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so maybe in the future i will choose a job (%hesitation%) about my major
SI12BD-00398-P10008 1 SI12BD-00398 10.39 15.33 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think environment is very important in our daily life
SI12BD-00398-P10008 1 SI12BD-00398 15.33 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) this career is (%hesitation%) very useful
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 5.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think this topic both have advantages as (dis-) disadvantages
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 5.08 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) speaking for advantages maybe university students have (%hesitation%) more can get more work experience through the practice work process
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 16.38 30.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) students didn't have too much time to (s-) (%hesitation%) to work in the university because students in the university maybe the most important task is study
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 30.67 40.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) they need to they need to focus on their classes to get more profession knowledge about their major
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 40.55 46.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so maybe sometimes they can't balance the time of study and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) working
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 46.98 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i think maybe some (%hesitation%) some (%hesitation%) university classes can (%hesitation%) include some practice work experience but not all of them
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 10.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this graph giving some information about the numbers of people visiting the site during their first week online
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 10.14 14.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) there have three online pop music sites
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 14.71 19.12 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the red one is tunes net and the blue one is music now
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 19.12 21.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the yellow one is songs for you
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 21.49 33.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and of in this (%hesitation%) diagram we can see that (%hesitation%) the red one tunes net is (%hesitation%) increased in these seven day
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 33.83 42.68 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the blue and yellow one that music now and the songs for you is (%hesitation%) reduced (%hesitation%) in this four day
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 42.68 59.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) we can we can (ca-) clearly see that in the first day the (%hesitation%) tune net is (%hesitation%) lowest (%hesitation%) lowest (%hesitation%) use of the people
SI12BD-00398-P40018 1 SI12BD-00398 59.46 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the
SI12BD-00398-P50019 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 11.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the most (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) important factor is to have have patient because we need to cooperation with everyone in this team
SI12BD-00398-P50019 1 SI12BD-00398 11.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so we need to have patient to work with other and listen others' require and ask ask their question
SI12BD-00398-P50020 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 6.61 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think in a small team maybe we don't have many person we can talk
SI12BD-00398-P50020 1 SI12BD-00398 6.61 13.49 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so maybe we can't create many interesting idea or listen other opinion
SI12BD-00398-P50020 1 SI12BD-00398 13.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) is very (%hesitation%) is a disadvantages in a small team
SI12BD-00398-P50021 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 12.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think disagreement is a very important thing in teamwork because through the disagreement we can create more interesting idea in teamwork is helpful
SI12BD-00398-P50021 1 SI12BD-00398 12.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) but it also will influence the (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) effective in teamwork
SI12BD-00398-P50022 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 7.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes maybe face to face is more effective than online (%hesitation%) (t-) meeting
SI12BD-00398-P50022 1 SI12BD-00398 7.38 14.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) sometime every not everyone have the same time that we can hold a meeting
SI12BD-00398-P50022 1 SI12BD-00398 14.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so maybe online is more effective than the face to face form
SI12BD-00398-P50023 1 SI12BD-00398 0.00 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe teamwork it have a better results than working alone and (%hesitation%) because in a team (%hesitation%) we have many peoples so maybe sometimes we can get more information and creative (%hesitation%) interesting idea in a team
SI12BD-00398-P50023 1 SI12BD-00398 17.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and also (%hesitation%) teamwork
SI12BD-00471-P10005 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 7.49 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well if i have to being honest i have to say that i'm not really interest in the environment
SI12BD-00471-P10005 1 SI12BD-00471 7.49 19.13 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) that's probably due to the fact that i'm afraid of all the animals and so i'm not really (%hesitation%) correlated to that kind of things
SI12BD-00471-P10005 1 SI12BD-00471 19.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't really
SI12BD-00471-P10006 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we are really into hanging out but also we absolutely love staying at home and watching movie or tv series while eating some pizza (%hesitation%) and drinking beers or coca cola
SI12BD-00471-P10007 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 2.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's a nice question
SI12BD-00471-P10007 1 SI12BD-00471 2.23 7.51 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i mean i cannot decide which person of my family is more similar to me
SI12BD-00471-P10007 1 SI12BD-00471 7.51 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's probably due to the fact that (%hesitation%) i am similar from different aspect (%hesitation%) to different (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) person in my family
SI12BD-00471-P10007 1 SI12BD-00471 17.66 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) so i can't made up my
SI12BD-00471-P10008 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 2.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i would like to leave in milan
SI12BD-00471-P10008 1 SI12BD-00471 2.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in fact i absolutely love that city and the fact that it has plenty of (%hesitation%) utilities and also for the transport to milan it's the perfect city and for the shopping so that i would like to live here forever
SI12BD-00471-P30017 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 6.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> doing some sport at school it's really important
SI12BD-00471-P30017 1 SI12BD-00471 6.88 16.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in italy it's (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) every (sch-) every school have (%hesitation%) at least one hour of (%hesitation%) gym at (%hesitation%) at school
SI12BD-00471-P30017 1 SI12BD-00471 16.60 21.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) obviously the advantages are related to our (%hesitation%) our healthy
SI12BD-00471-P30017 1 SI12BD-00471 21.82 34.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantages as correlated to the fact that some people could agree that (%hesitation%) that sport (%hesitation%) isn't (%hesitation%) as important as the culture math and so on
SI12BD-00471-P30017 1 SI12BD-00471 34.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) as far as i'm concern it's important to have some sport (%hesitation%) class at school because it also help (%hesitation%) students to (%hesitation%) to wind down their mind so to (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) stop (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) thinking for at least one hour and to relax more if (%hesitation%) sport is a relax at all
SI12BD-00471-P40018 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 7.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> good starting point (%hesitation%) should be the bee that collect the nectar from flowers
SI12BD-00471-P40018 1 SI12BD-00471 7.71 11.49 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (%hesitation%) the bees will make honey from nectar
SI12BD-00471-P40018 1 SI12BD-00471 11.49 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) that nectar will be collected by the (bee-) beekeepers (%hesitation%) that will (%hesitation%) produce honey
SI12BD-00471-P40018 1 SI12BD-00471 21.38 34.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) after being produce the honey (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) being transported in the in the (%hesitation%) supermarket and the outlet (%hesitation%) to be sold (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00471-P40018 1 SI12BD-00471 34.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so then the precious honey will be sold to family and people to be eaten with milk (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) so on
SI12BD-00471-P50019 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 11.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for made up their mind about the country where to go they should (%hesitation%) consider the fact that they have to speak with other people in that country
SI12BD-00471-P50019 1 SI12BD-00471 11.03 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so they have to learn that that language and also maybe to attend a course to (%hesitation%) learn that's that language (b-) better
SI12BD-00471-P50020 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 7.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well there are plenty of cons on (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) knowing another language
SI12BD-00471-P50020 1 SI12BD-00471 7.25 12.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) first of all it could be (ure-) really useful for your future working life
SI12BD-00471-P50020 1 SI12BD-00471 12.57 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in fact for example it is is really it is really a surplus when you know another language in a cv
SI12BD-00471-P50021 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 7.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well there are (%hesitation%) great amount of difficulties that (%hesitation%) a a students can find
SI12BD-00471-P50021 1 SI12BD-00471 7.02 11.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example (%hesitation%) the fact that that you have to talk with other people
SI12BD-00471-P50021 1 SI12BD-00471 11.84 17.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so at the beginning it will be really difficult to understand them and (%hesitation%) to approach with them
SI12BD-00471-P50021 1 SI12BD-00471 17.45 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but then you (%hesitation%) the students will (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00471-P50022 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 5.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i'd say that the best way is to interact with people from that country
SI12BD-00471-P50022 1 SI12BD-00471 5.82 15.92 <o,Q4,B2,P5> obviously spending time with them (%hesitation%) can help you to learn their habits and also about their country their eat also their eating habits
SI12BD-00471-P50022 1 SI12BD-00471 15.92 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's a really important part of a culture of a (%hesitation%) (pa-)
SI12BD-00471-P50023 1 SI12BD-00471 0.00 18.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i'd say so yeah absolutely as living in another country will help you to become more much more independent because you you cannot (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) count on your family and you will have to (%hesitation%) do everything alone
SI12BD-00471-P50023 1 SI12BD-00471 18.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00484-P10005 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 15.15 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very interested because (%hesitation%) you can learn about (%hesitation%) their their cultures and how the people are how people are excuse me
SI12BD-00484-P10005 1 SI12BD-00484 15.15 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i think it's important
SI12BD-00484-P10006 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 6.55 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my free time i like doing some exercise
SI12BD-00484-P10006 1 SI12BD-00484 6.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i like (%hesitation%) watching tv shows listening to music or maybe reading (%hesitation%) books because i love it
SI12BD-00484-P10007 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i reckon that the best way to improve my english is talking and talking and talking english because (%hesitation%) it's the only way that you can (%hesitation%) lose your
SI12BD-00484-P10008 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it could be (%hesitation%) taking things with calm because i i
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 11.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i reckon that the advantage would be that you can earn money and you can pay (%hesitation%) your studies
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 11.98 22.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) you can developed some skills that you can that could (%hesitation%) help you in the future
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 22.77 30.12 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and maybe you can put it (%hesitation%) that works in on cv
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 30.12 40.29 <o,Q5,B2,P3> mainly the disadvantage (%hesitation%) could be that you can't (%hesitation%) spend your time studying
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 40.29 49.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i (th-) (%hesitation%) i mean you have (%hesitation%) less time to study or doing homework
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 49.05 56.63 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) well i think that it could be a good idea work
SI12BD-00484-P30017 1 SI12BD-00484 56.63 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but only if it (sho-)
SI12BD-00484-P40018 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 12.49 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in the last decades the population has increased vehicles' use and many factories has been created
SI12BD-00484-P40018 1 SI12BD-00484 12.49 24.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and because of that (%hesitation%) many particles and (%hesitation%) toxins are liberated to the atmosphere
SI12BD-00484-P40018 1 SI12BD-00484 24.98 48.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and this (i-) (%hesitation%) this is (%hesitation%) too bad for (%hesitation%) the environment because some of these particles and toxins (%hesitation%) mix with cloud water or some of others and others (%hesitation%) can fall as dust
SI12BD-00484-P40018 1 SI12BD-00484 48.02 57.35 <o,Q5,B2,P4> but (%hesitation%) those that mix with cloud water (%hesitation%) then fall (%hesitation%) in in rain
SI12BD-00484-P40018 1 SI12BD-00484 57.35 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and it's
SI12BD-00484-P50019 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 8.87 <o,Q4,B1,P5> first of all you need to know that this is good for you and think about like a fun activity
SI12BD-00484-P50019 1 SI12BD-00484 8.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> after that (%hesitation%) you need (%hesitation%) take your time to
SI12BD-00484-P50020 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 11.50 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because our body is make of water (%hesitation%) we need to drink water for ourselves
SI12BD-00484-P50020 1 SI12BD-00484 11.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is good because we feel more healthy
SI12BD-00484-P50021 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 9.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> not every day but (%hesitation%) yes at least three times a week because we need to clean our body
SI12BD-00484-P50021 1 SI12BD-00484 9.80 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and (%hesitation%) we need (%hesitation%) our muscles and bones strong for (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00484-P50022 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i totally agree because our organism need to rest too and (%hesitation%) repair all the damage that that (%hesitation%) produce all
SI12BD-00484-P50023 1 SI12BD-00484 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> negative effect because (%hesitation%) this is something (stre-) stressful for us and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) make that anyone moves and go out to the street
SI12BD-00499-P10005 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 6.26 <o,Q4,C,P1> very much interested in learning other countries' cultures
SI12BD-00499-P10005 1 SI12BD-00499 6.26 15.84 <o,Q4,C,P1> after graduating high school in japan i moved to the u k spent one year then (%hesitation%) went to irish university for four years
SI12BD-00499-P10005 1 SI12BD-00499 15.84 17.21 <o,Q4,C,P1> now i'm in the u s
SI12BD-00499-P10005 1 SI12BD-00499 17.21 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so i learnt a lot about different cultures
SI12BD-00499-P10006 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 5.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> i spend most of my free time with my family
SI12BD-00499-P10006 1 SI12BD-00499 5.85 18.28 <o,Q4,C,P1> i've got a son and daughter so i spend most of time with them playing drawing chatting watching tv together playing game together
SI12BD-00499-P10006 1 SI12BD-00499 18.28 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's a joy to spend time
SI12BD-00499-P10007 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 12.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> when i was in japan and did not have many opportunities to speak the best way to do is shadowing meaning listen to the radio and speak after that
SI12BD-00499-P10007 1 SI12BD-00499 12.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but now i am living in the u s and i've got opportunities to speak listen write and with my colleagues in every day so that's
SI12BD-00499-P10008 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 10.83 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to learn how to cut and cook fishes because now i started a new fishing as a new hobby
SI12BD-00499-P10008 1 SI12BD-00499 10.83 16.84 <o,Q4,C,P1> and if you can you know cut and cook fishes and it's great
SI12BD-00499-P10008 1 SI12BD-00499 16.84 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and you can fish and cook and eat nice fresh
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 11.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> i do not agree with the statement that that all university student should do some part time jobs
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 11.71 17.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> there is an advantage of doing a part time job as a student
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 17.64 30.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> obviously you you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you want to spend you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily lives
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 30.41 33.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> but on the other hand you have to balance your time
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 33.92 38.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> you have to study (%hesitation%) in the library
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 38.22 42.65 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you're a student the main thing you've got to do is studying
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 42.65 54.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> so if if (g-) enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do (%hesitation%) apartment job
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 54.95 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so i the this is the reason why i do not agree with the sentence
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 12.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so here's how acid rain is caused and eventually damaged environment
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 12.29 28.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all acid is acid particles are created via emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and and any other sources
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 28.92 44.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then acid particles as smoke go up in the air and within that air acid particles are carried by wind and it forms cloud
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 44.50 54.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid directly falls to the ground and damage the the soils or ponds river ocean
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 54.88 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the other acid particle mix with cloud water and then
SI12BD-00499-P50019 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets and alcohols
SI12BD-00499-P50020 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i (%hesitation%) think it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking coffee only coffees or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's not essential to do exercise every single day but it is important to do some exercise
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 10.04 17.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> it depends on your age your gender and what level of healthiness you're looking for
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 17.61 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but certainly doing exercise is good for you
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 11.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> i do not necessarily agree that every single person need eight hours of sleep every day
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 11.40 18.29 <o,Q4,C,P5> on average it it would be good to have eight hours' sleep but it again depending on a person
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 18.29 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> he may only need six hours
SI12BD-00499-P50023 1 SI12BD-00499 0.00 5.92 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's a difficult question and it's quite hard to provide one answer
SI12BD-00499-P50023 1 SI12BD-00499 5.92 14.21 <o,Q4,C,P5> technology it certainly has a good aspect to provide information about your body more visible information will be provided
SI12BD-00499-P50023 1 SI12BD-00499 14.21 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but at the same time if you you have to work (%hesitation%) stay smartphone all the time it's quite
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,C,P1> i see environment as a pretty serious issue coz nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535 11.57 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> so normally when i go out i bring my own bottle own container for food et cetera
SI12BD-00535-P10006 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> me and my friends enjoying going to for a window shopping having finding nice dining restaurants for (%hesitation%) supper and (%hesitation%) as well as go to a cinema to enjoy a movie
SI12BD-00535-P10007 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 4.95 <o,Q4,C,P1> in my family i'm most similar to my mother
SI12BD-00535-P10007 1 SI12BD-00535 4.95 15.13 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) she is the one who always takes cares of me and (%hesitation%) pays all my tuition fees for the school
SI12BD-00535-P10007 1 SI12BD-00535 15.13 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> and she always took me out when she has some event
SI12BD-00535-P10008 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 7.27 <o,Q5,C,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00535-P10008 1 SI12BD-00535 7.27 13.48 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm currently living in taipei because of the work i used to do here
SI12BD-00535-P10008 1 SI12BD-00535 13.48 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 10.24 <o,Q5,C,P3> there are some pros and cons if schools and colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 10.24 31.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> the negative points the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercise and they will become very sweaty (%hesitation%) in the way that the classroom will fill with (%hesitation%) bad smells
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 31.21 53.67 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to keep fit keep fit and to be more (%hesitation%) able to focused on what they are learning coz there's a study saying that (%hesitation%) exercise can help people to get focused
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 53.67 58.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> and they will become effective learners
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 58.79 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 6.47 <o,Q5,C,P4> today's presentation is about how honey is produced
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 6.47 11.20 <o,Q5,C,P4> there are six steps (%hesitation%) of it
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 11.20 14.29 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it's from the flower to shop
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 14.29 20.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> so first of all the bees has to collect have to collect nectar from the flowers
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 20.84 26.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that they will make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 26.88 36.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> after making the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into the jar
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 36.68 48.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sells the honey
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 48.04 57.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in the end the customers will get the bee will get the honey from the supermarket
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 57.11 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> that's the process of
SI12BD-00535-P50019 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 12.76 <o,Q5,C,P5> when choosing a country to study in (%hesitation%) students should consider about the culture first whether it suits (%hesitation%) their preferences
SI12BD-00535-P50019 1 SI12BD-00535 12.76 16.14 <o,Q5,C,P5> and secondly it's the weather
SI12BD-00535-P50019 1 SI12BD-00535 16.14 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> whether the the weather is similar to their (m-)
SI12BD-00535-P50020 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 16.78 <o,Q4,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00535-P50020 1 SI12BD-00535 16.78 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> it differs you from your (%hesitation%) own
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 12.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> students may find it difficult (%hesitation%) about the culture when they study in another country because different country have different cultures
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 12.88 17.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> it might be extremely opposite from their home country
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 17.71 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so they need time to adapt
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 9.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535 9.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) like this they can all hang out together in a way that they can experience the local culture
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535 0.00 9.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think studying abroad indeed helps (%hesitation%) students to become more (in-) independent
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535 9.11 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> as for me i have i (wa-) i used to study abroad for a year and that makes me more important because i have to do everything on my own including cooking
SI12BD-00547-P10005 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love learning about new countries new languages new cultures because i think that the more you know about new societies different societies and new ways of thinking (%hesitation%) the better person you can become
SI12BD-00547-P10006 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 8.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i used to have a dog and then i used to love taking him (%hesitation%) to parks or for walks
SI12BD-00547-P10006 1 SI12BD-00547 8.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> nowadays he passed (%hesitation%) he passed away and nowadays i like to read and watch tv series and movies
SI12BD-00547-P10007 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> practicing with a especially with a demanding teacher who corrects me all the time and helps me improve my pronunciation and grammar and going to school and studying studying and studying
SI12BD-00547-P10008 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it would be dancing because i think it's a great job it's relaxing and it it would also improve my self confidence
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 5.55 <o,Q4,C,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they're studying
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 5.55 26.67 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion this should be optional (%hesitation%) for for the students because on the one hand the (%hesitation%) the ones who don't work would have the opportunity to check how real life works and (%hesitation%) put into practice the the theory they learn in class
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 26.67 47.19 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand for those who already (s-) worked for self support or to support their families it would be a (bi-) great disadvantage because they wouldn't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be (%hesitation%) rewarding (%hesitation%) in question of money
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 47.19 51.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> i've been through this situation and it was really exhausting
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 51.75 58.09 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) most teachers don't understand that you (ha-) you do have to work to support yourself
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 58.09 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) i
SI12BD-00547-P40018 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 14.43 <o,Q4,C,P4> the all the pollution caused by by vehicles and factories are the ones that cause the asdid acidive rain
SI12BD-00547-P40018 1 SI12BD-00547 14.43 32.48 <o,Q4,C,P4> since the the particles (%hesitation%) are carried away by the wind get to the clouds and are (tran-) are transported to earth by water in the form of rain or in the form of snow
SI12BD-00547-P40018 1 SI12BD-00547 32.48 48.25 <o,Q4,C,P4> and it's terrible not only to the environment and animals and plants but also to humans and water reseveratories because we these are the the food and the water we are going to drink
SI12BD-00547-P40018 1 SI12BD-00547 48.25 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> so the government should be more (restrict-) more demanding (%hesitation%) with the factories in order to avoid this problem
SI12BD-00547-P50019 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 7.39 <o,Q4,C,P5> first of all i think people should cut down on sugar salt and processed food
SI12BD-00547-P50019 1 SI12BD-00547 7.39 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and as a vegetarian i would also suggest people to reduce or cut totally down as much as red meat as possible (s-)
SI12BD-00547-P50020 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 5.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> it is extremely (s-) important as long as you respect your body
SI12BD-00547-P50020 1 SI12BD-00547 5.43 16.82 <o,Q4,C,P5> remember not two litres maybe too much for a person who weighs fifty kilos but be too (%hesitation%) little for a person who weighs a hundred kilos
SI12BD-00547-P50020 1 SI12BD-00547 16.82 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so you should talk you should always talk to a doctor
SI12BD-00547-P50021 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 4.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it is essential to do exercise
SI12BD-00547-P50021 1 SI12BD-00547 4.62 9.46 <o,Q4,C,P5> and the question about being every day depends on a person's habits
SI12BD-00547-P50021 1 SI12BD-00547 9.46 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> some people don't have the (%hesitation%) don't have enough time to do it every day but they should at least fifteen ten minutes as much as
SI12BD-00547-P50022 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i personally disagree because i need nine hours of sleep but some people do well on seven hours
SI12BD-00547-P50022 1 SI12BD-00547 10.04 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> the thing is sleeping less than that can be dangerous for you because your brain need (ti-) needs time to to recover from the
SI12BD-00547-P50023 1 SI12BD-00547 0.00 6.27 <o,Q4,C,P5> this is a tricky question because it depends on how people deal with technology
SI12BD-00547-P50023 1 SI12BD-00547 6.27 13.49 <o,Q4,C,P5> on the one hand it can be good because you can research about (%hesitation%) good ways better ways of life
SI12BD-00547-P50023 1 SI12BD-00547 13.49 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but on the other hand it can be bad because people are spending too much time in front of screen
SI12BD-00576-P10005 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 10.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> currently i live in london which is (%hesitation%) which is the largest city in united kingdom
SI12BD-00576-P10005 1 SI12BD-00576 10.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is a very beautiful but it's really noisy as well
SI12BD-00576-P10006 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 5.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> usually have a lot of time to to spend
SI12BD-00576-P10006 1 SI12BD-00576 5.10 10.70 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i'm on holiday i like to to practice my hobbies
SI12BD-00576-P10006 1 SI12BD-00576 10.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i have several of them but my favourite is taking photos and edited them
SI12BD-00576-P10007 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 5.08 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i really enjoy spending time with my sister
SI12BD-00576-P10007 1 SI12BD-00576 5.08 9.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> she is younger than me and she is amazing
SI12BD-00576-P10007 1 SI12BD-00576 9.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> she is not only very funny she's also very intelligent and very amazing
SI12BD-00576-P10008 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 1.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> law
SI12BD-00576-P10008 1 SI12BD-00576 1.32 7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> however when i moved to london i realise how much i love fashion
SI12BD-00576-P10008 1 SI12BD-00576 7.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would like to do something related to fashion such as visual merchandiser or (%hesitation%) designer
SI12BD-00576-P30017 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 12.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> so basically i strongly believe that to get job to earn some money to invest on pay you university is a very good idea
SI12BD-00576-P30017 1 SI12BD-00576 12.72 20.29 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) the advantage is that you are going to be independent economic independent of your parents
SI12BD-00576-P30017 1 SI12BD-00576 20.29 43.24 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the disadvantage could be that (%hesitation%) you won't have a lot of time to have a great time to your friend and also (%hesitation%) maybe (%hesitation%) you won't have a lot of time to study
SI12BD-00576-P30017 1 SI12BD-00576 43.24 53.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) however my opinion is that if you want to get a very good future you need to do that
SI12BD-00576-P30017 1 SI12BD-00576 53.04 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i strongly believe that is a very good idea
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 6.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> basically first at all you need to arrive to the airport
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 6.79 13.32 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so you must to take a car bus or train
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 13.32 17.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the best option is a train because it's very fast
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 17.86 29.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) in addition (%hesitation%) when you arrive to the airport you need to do the check in so you must to wear your passport with you
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 29.24 38.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then you need to go to the document control and you need to show your passport and your (%hesitation%) ticket
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 38.47 51.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then you need to pass for the security control and then you need to wait until the the hour of the department
SI12BD-00576-P40018 1 SI12BD-00576 51.33 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you need to (%hesitation%) go abroad and then you are going to the plane is going to run off
SI12BD-00576-P50019 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 8.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that students can use technology not only for looking for information
SI12BD-00576-P50019 1 SI12BD-00576 8.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can also use technology to improve their skills on several things
SI12BD-00576-P50020 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 2.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with them
SI12BD-00576-P50020 1 SI12BD-00576 2.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i strongly believe that having a teacher in front of you teaching you (%hesitation%) whatever you like to to learn is (t-) more effective than online courses
SI12BD-00576-P50021 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> when students are working on group projects together (%hesitation%) they are learning to to be good on teamworks which is a very important skill
SI12BD-00576-P50022 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 9.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5>
SI12BD-00576-P50022 1 SI12BD-00576 9.03 7.47 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that it depends on how good your teacher is
SI12BD-00576-P50022 1 SI12BD-00576 7.47 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because is your if your teacher is not really good (%hesitation%) probably you will learn more alone in your in your house
SI12BD-00576-P50023 1 SI12BD-00576 0.00 14.42 <o,Q4,B2,P5> very very important due to the fact that there are a lot of people who doesn't have enough resource to buy several thing things by theirself
SI12BD-00576-P50023 1 SI12BD-00576 14.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so the university needs to provide
SI12BD-00601-P10005 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 3.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i live in a tiny village
SI12BD-00601-P10005 1 SI12BD-00601 3.94 12.09 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's a rural village and it's surrounded by beautiful landscapes and stunning views
SI12BD-00601-P10005 1 SI12BD-00601 12.09 14.21 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's quite breathtaking
SI12BD-00601-P10005 1 SI12BD-00601 14.21 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> also it's a coastal village because they have the
SI12BD-00601-P10006 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in holiday i like travel to different countries to discover and explore (%hesitation%) foreigns culture because i'm a open minded person
SI12BD-00601-P10007 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 9.08 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i like to spending time my free time with my sister because is the same age as me

SI12BD-00601-P10008 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 11.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future i would like to have a job relationship with my degree (%hesitation%) as an engineer of industrial technology
SI12BD-00601-P10008 1 SI12BD-00601 11.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> this could be an excellent opportunity to (%hesitation%) develop my skills about (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-00601-P30017 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 14.12 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion i strongly believe that not all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies because there are some students that can afford (%hesitation%) their university studies
SI12BD-00601-P30017 1 SI12BD-00601 14.12 25.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but (%hesitation%) the students who can afford their university studies (%hesitation%) get a job it would be a good way
SI12BD-00601-P30017 1 SI12BD-00601 25.23 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example whereas (%hesitation%) the main advantage is earn money but the drawback is the time that waste for working as their job
SI12BD-00601-P40018 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 5.65 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this diagram show the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI12BD-00601-P40018 1 SI12BD-00601 5.65 13.09 <o,Q5,B1,P4> before landing you must check in your document control
SI12BD-00601-P40018 1 SI12BD-00601 13.09 19.14 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and you (%hesitation%) will pass the security security control
SI12BD-00601-P40018 1 SI12BD-00601 19.14 35.66 <o,Q5,B1,P4> next you have some time to wait (%hesitation%) in the airport doing some shopping or going to toilet or a coffee centre
SI12BD-00601-P40018 1 SI12BD-00601 35.66 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> when needs a time you board to the plane and next (%hesitation%) finally you landed
SI12BD-00601-P50019 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion technology produces a very good way to students for learn because they could have (%hesitation%) own device like a tablet that could learn (s-) their lessons
SI12BD-00601-P50020 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 6.13 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yes i reckon that face to face is the best way to learn
SI12BD-00601-P50020 1 SI12BD-00601 6.13 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but nowadays technology improves (%hesitation%) allow (%hesitation%) students to study with (%hesitation%) with online
SI12BD-00601-P50021 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's so important working as a group projects because students (%hesitation%) develops skills like talking with each others and take a decision about (%hesitation%) some projects that
SI12BD-00601-P50022 1 SI12BD-00601 0.00 12.63 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion i don't think that attending lectures is better than reading alone because reading alone (%hesitation%) you improve yourself

SI12BD-00850-P10007 1 SI12BD-00850 0.00 19.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think that the best way to improve my english is go to the other country (%hesitation%) when where where speak english and and pass a long time and work in this country
SI12BD-00850-P10007 1 SI12BD-00850 19.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and
SI12BD-00850-P10008 1 SI12BD-00850 0.00 6.33 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i could learn (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i don't know
SI12BD-00850-P10008 1 SI12BD-00850 6.33 14.58 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think that the most skill (%hesitation%) belief of all humans is fly
SI12BD-00850-P10008 1 SI12BD-00850 14.58 18.88 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think (%hesitation%) i am very happy if i can fly
SI12BD-00850-P10008 1 SI12BD-00850 18.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and for this
SI12BD-00850-P30017 1 SI12BD-00850 0.00 15.68 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for one part one advantage is that you that the students can can win money
SI12BD-00850-P30017 1 SI12BD-00850 15.68 33.64 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) it's it is a best part for you can spend the money in your matrical of the university or in other course or other other things
SI12BD-00850-P30017 1 SI12BD-00850 33.64 50.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> that other part is is bad because you don't have (m-) much (%hesitation%) time for the studies because the job create very time
SI12BD-00850-P30017 1 SI12BD-00850 50.56 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for this motive in my opinion (%hesitation%) not is a good idea (%hesitation%) job and
SI12BD-00850-P40018 1 SI12BD-00850 0.00 17.59 <o,Q3,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) acid rains begin to form when moisture in the air combines with acid particles emitted by factories and vehicles
SI12BD-00850-P40018 1 SI12BD-00850 17.59 37.26 <o,Q3,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) after (%hesitation%) the acid particles are carried by the wind and other acid particles mix with the cloud water and precipitate in rain or snow form

SI12BD-00850-P50021 1 SI12BD-00850 0.00 6.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion exercising is essential to have a good quality of life

SI12BD-00942-P10008 1 SI12BD-00942 13.54 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and in the urban area there are more peaceful and there're more quiet
SI12BD-00942-P30017 1 SI12BD-00942 0.00 12.13 <o,Q5,B1,P3> fitness classes in school day may cause may bring advantages or disadvantages to the students

SI12BD-00942-P30017 1 SI12BD-00942 42.18 55.42 <o,Q5,B1,P3> however there are some disadvantages where the student may not focus in their class and then this will cause them to lest have lesser time to do their study
SI12BD-00942-P30017 1 SI12BD-00942 55.42 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in my opinion i think that fitness class should be implement in the school and

SI12BD-00942-P40018 1 SI12BD-00942 12.67 20.52 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the bees will make the honey that they collected from nectar in their beehives
SI12BD-00942-P40018 1 SI12BD-00942 20.52 28.21 <o,Q5,B1,P4> after that the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives
SI12BD-00942-P40018 1 SI12BD-00942 28.21 43.72 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the honey will be produce and process and package into the packaging which normally will be a bottle

SI12BD-01012-P50020 1 SI12BD-01012 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that drinking (%hesitation%) lots of water is very important for everybody because (%hesitation%) our body consists mainly from water and all processes in our body (%hesitation%) are unable (%hesitation%) to be without water
SI12BD-01012-P50021 1 SI12BD-01012 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think it's essential (%hesitation%) to do exercises every day (%hesitation%) because in this way (%hesitation%) a person can (%hesitation%) keep their keep their fit and be in a good station
SI12BD-01012-P50022 1 SI12BD-01012 0.00 10.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) well i agree with the opinion that people have to sleep at least (s-) eight hours a day (%hesitation%) not less
SI12BD-01012-P50022 1 SI12BD-01012 10.56 13.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but maybe somebody needs more sleeping
SI12BD-01012-P50022 1 SI12BD-01012 13.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it is very important (%hesitation%) to give bay body (%hesitation%)

SI12BD-01033-P10006 1 SI12BD-01033 4.96 7.93 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love to check and see new places
SI12BD-01033-P10006 1 SI12BD-01033 7.93 17.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love to go around and do the bicycle hiking running around the parks looking to the no nature with my family
SI12BD-01033-P10006 1 SI12BD-01033 17.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) that is the best thing i would like to do

SI12BD-01033-P10007 1 SI12BD-01033 4.30 11.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> they are very small now and they are fulled of a lot of curiosity about everything they do
SI12BD-01033-P10007 1 SI12BD-01033 11.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when we go out for example i like to show them how to behave in the street if you are walking outside or how to ride the (bi-) the bicycle for
SI12BD-01033-P10008 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 5.92 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'd like to have a job where i can use all my capacities and skills
SI12BD-01033-P10008 1 SI12BD-01033 5.92 11.50 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would prefer a job in an office where i can sit from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon
SI12BD-01033-P10008 1 SI12BD-01033 11.50 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so after that i could have some quality time with my family doing things together maybe eating food together
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 9.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> we are going to talk about if students should get jobs while they are doing their university studies
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 9.23 13.49 <o,Q4,C,P3> we we know that everybody is going to get jobs because of the money
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 13.49 15.54 <o,Q4,C,P3> the money is always good to have
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 15.54 35.86 <o,Q4,C,P3> but considering that the time you have to invest for working is the time you will take out from the university classes and i think you should be focusing especially when you are at at school when where you have a lot of more freedom in what is important
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 35.86 48.01 <o,Q4,C,P3> and what is important in that time is that you have to sit and listen to your teachers and learn and go deep and research investigate not only focusing in the money in that short period of time
SI12BD-01033-P30017 1 SI12BD-01033 48.01 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> after all when you get a (j-) real job when you are graduated you will have a lot of years to make more money and to pay your loan debts little by little without stressing your
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 1.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 1.92 5.32 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today i'm going to teach you how to travelling by an airplane
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 5.32 12.62 <o,Q4,B2,P4> to be able to take an airplane first you need to take transportation to get to the place called airport
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 12.62 16.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the airport is the place where the (%hesitation%) airplanes go out
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 16.41 22.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you are in at the airport you need to go and do the check in with an assistant
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 22.34 37.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after the assistant has checked that you have the right place then you need to pass on to the document control where the policeman is going to ask you about your passport to checking that you have to the the (n-) right name on it

SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 42.65 51.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that then you have to you have to wait to be called to get (%hesitation%) on board of the airplane in order one to one
SI12BD-01033-P40018 1 SI12BD-01033 51.86 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then after you have to place your seat and wait until the airplane departure to take you to your final
SI12BD-01033-P50019 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 8.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to study more effectively students can use the technology of their smartphones for example
SI12BD-01033-P50019 1 SI12BD-01033 8.87 16.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there they can do (%hesitation%) calendars where they can write it down all they have to do during all the day the weeks and the month
SI12BD-01033-P50019 1 SI12BD-01033 16.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> after that they can use their smartphone also to make phone
SI12BD-01033-P50020 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 13.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> a face to face class is equally the same as having online because with the use of the new technologies you can talk directly to the to your teacher through your computer
SI12BD-01033-P50020 1 SI12BD-01033 13.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so for me it doesn't make any difference between doing make it face face to face or online (clo-) classes
SI12BD-01033-P50021 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 8.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-01033-P50021 1 SI12BD-01033 8.87 15.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also you can ask for question to your partner that maybe you didn't listen before
SI12BD-01033-P50021 1 SI12BD-01033 15.17 19.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you can help you can get help from them with the organisation of the work
SI12BD-01033-P50021 1 SI12BD-01033 19.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so
SI12BD-01033-P50022 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 5.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (pinion-) attending lecture is actually more efficient than reading alone
SI12BD-01033-P50022 1 SI12BD-01033 5.56 13.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because when you go and see your teacher speaking about the subject then you can get more (at-) more attention into details
SI12BD-01033-P50022 1 SI12BD-01033 13.45 15.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> he can explain a little bit further
SI12BD-01033-P50022 1 SI12BD-01033 15.36 17.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there is easier to understand
SI12BD-01033-P50022 1 SI12BD-01033 17.60 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe you can raise your hand and make question
SI12BD-01033-P50023 1 SI12BD-01033 0.00 11.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> facilities provided by the university are (ba-) are basics nowadays because with the use of the technology we can improve our research
SI12BD-01033-P50023 1 SI12BD-01033 11.45 19.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example if you need to buy a book or you need to read about some interesting topic then you can go and sit on the computer and get it right away
SI12BD-01033-P50023 1 SI12BD-01033 19.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (a-)
SI12BD-01064-P10005 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very interested in environment and also i am worried because people (%hesitation%) use a lot of plastics and we aren't concerned about this
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 6.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well we love go to the cinema in summer go to the beach
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064 6.05 8.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but the summer is a little different
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064 8.82 17.92 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but we love go out together and go running or other sports
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064 17.92 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> this is all
SI12BD-01064-P10007 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) maybe physically it's my mother but in personality probably my brother or my father because (%hesitation%) my father is more relaxed and more independent and me too

SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 18.45 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in the school time is that all students can practise practice a sport and so they are more healthy
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 18.45 40.33 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) they in the school they need to reduce the time of other subjects (%hesitation%) maybe maths or maybe language or i don't know but need to to to reduce another subject
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 40.33 57.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion in my opinion it's a good idea because (%hesitation%) children and teenagers (%hesitation%) usually don't practise sport and it's very important for for their health their health
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 57.20 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so it's it's a good idea
SI12BD-01064-P40018 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 22.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in the picture i can see a diagram about honey and how honey comes to the flower or the yeah the flowers and goes to the to the shop
SI12BD-01064-P40018 1 SI12BD-01064 22.91 41.02 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well (%hesitation%) first (%hesitation%) beaks bees collect nectar from the flowers and they make honey from nectar in the beehives
SI12BD-01064-P40018 1 SI12BD-01064 41.02 56.80 <o,Q5,B1,P4> later the (beekee-) beekeepers who is the person who collect the honey collect the honey and (%hesitation%) put in in the in the dot in the tub
SI12BD-01064-P40018 1 SI12BD-01064 56.80 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the
SI12BD-01064-P50019 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 16.82 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i imagine they will consider the the language of the country (%hesitation%) the universities that there are in the country the culture
SI12BD-01064-P50019 1 SI12BD-01064 16.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> if it is a country with a lot of
SI12BD-01064-P50020 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 10.26 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the main advantage of studying in a second language is that you can improve your language
SI12BD-01064-P50020 1 SI12BD-01064 10.26 13.61 <o,Q5,B1,P5> maybe if it is english you can improve your english
SI12BD-01064-P50020 1 SI12BD-01064 13.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and you can meet person of in this country
SI12BD-01064-P50021 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 16.55 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the most obviously difficult is if you are in a country that don't speak your language you need to to speak in this idiom
SI12BD-01064-P50021 1 SI12BD-01064 16.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so this is difficult
SI12BD-01064-P50022 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 8.67 <o,Q4,B1,P5> speak with local people
SI12BD-01064-P50022 1 SI12BD-01064 8.67 12.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> go to the concert festivals
SI12BD-01064-P50022 1 SI12BD-01064 12.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> go to the cinema and listen (%hesitation%) films in this language
SI12BD-01064-P50023 1 SI12BD-01064 0.00 18.18 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i agree with this (%hesitation%) because when you travel alone and live alone in a (di-) a different country you need to to to make things alone
SI12BD-01064-P50023 1 SI12BD-01064 18.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and you don't have
SI12BD-01070-P10005 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> my favourite time of year is christmas
SI12BD-01070-P10006 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for me is not important to read or listen news

SI12BD-01070-P30017 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 5.14 <o,Q3,B2,P3> i would like to start saying the advantage
SI12BD-01070-P30017 1 SI12BD-01070 5.14 16.71 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion this kind of measures assure that the students acquire the skills that they will need in their futures work

SI12BD-01070-P30017 1 SI12BD-01070 27.35 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion must be a compromise between the study and practical time for taking the best of the work
SI12BD-01070-P40018 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 9.51 <o,Q3,B2,P4> we can see during the first of all days all of them started and maintained the same number of visit each one
SI12BD-01070-P40018 1 SI12BD-01070 9.51 35.52 <o,Q3,B2,P4> the most successfully was music now which start around seventy visits first day the first day increase its visits number till one hundred and ten the third day maintaining this fabulous number of visits three days and then and it fall down until eighty visit the seventh day
SI12BD-01070-P40018 1 SI12BD-01070 35.52 55.59 <o,Q3,B2,P4> with songs four you we see the opposite that successful because it started with a similar number that music now only a few visits less that music now around sixty (d-) sixty per day maintaining this is numbers for five days until the big fall the sixth and the seventh

SI12BD-01070-P50019 1 SI12BD-01070 12.54 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> if the leader is honestly (%hesitation%) all the people work really good
SI12BD-01070-P50020 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P5> the problems with small teams are the that all of them have (%hesitation%) have to work (%hesitation%) very close and this is a very very very important problem that we can to solve
SI12BD-01070-P50021 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 7.90 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't agree with this because the the team leader must be encouraged
SI12BD-01070-P50021 1 SI12BD-01070 7.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> if (the-) they are encouraged the team follow them wherever (%hesitation%) they go to (%hesitation%)
SI12BD-01070-P50022 1 SI12BD-01070 0.00 7.92 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that not because (%hesitation%) some things in the actuality are working in remote
SI12BD-01070-P50022 1 SI12BD-01070 7.92 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and this is perfect for some kind of works because not all people need to to stay together for work good

SI131R-00024-P10008 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i hope i will be working on something relative to human resources (%hesitation%) that gives me time to travel and maybe buy a camper and (%hesitation%) see spain
SI131R-00024-P30017 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 15.02 <o,Q4,B1,P3> doing internship has advantage like it give you the opportunity to join into a professional work and as as a result experience
SI131R-00024-P30017 1 SI131R-00024 15.02 21.01 <o,Q4,B1,P3> also enables a student to develop their skills
SI131R-00024-P30017 1 SI131R-00024 21.01 24.66 <o,Q4,B1,P3> on the other hand we have the disadvantage
SI131R-00024-P30017 1 SI131R-00024 24.66 30.66 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) it could be that the internship are not well paid
SI131R-00024-P30017 1 SI131R-00024 30.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my own opinion i think it's a good idea to be a trainee in some company and learn about real problems and also (%hesitation%) work in a team and have a boss who learn show you how to do things
SI131R-00024-P40018 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 8.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) the past week (%hesitation%) has been launched (%hesitation%) three new online pop music site

SI131R-00024-P40018 1 SI131R-00024 40.20 53.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but (%hesitation%) music now (%hesitation%) is then (%hesitation%) (con-) (%hesitation%) continues increase in the week
SI131R-00024-P40018 1 SI131R-00024 53.14 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but song four you (%hesitation%) we see that the
SI131R-00024-P50019 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 20.23 <o,Q4,B1,P5> for me (%hesitation%) a good team leader should be empathic (%hesitation%) with (oth-) other people (%hesitation%) get always ready to fix any problem quickly and keep the team united (%hesitation%) to have one direction
SI131R-00024-P50020 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 9.28 <o,Q4,B1,P5> work with small teams has problem like people get overwhelmed by the amount of work
SI131R-00024-P50020 1 SI131R-00024 9.28 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) maybe they don't get along between companions and also they can get tired to do always the same task
SI131R-00024-P50021 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 1.77 <o,Q4,B1,P5> absolutely
SI131R-00024-P50021 1 SI131R-00024 1.77 8.36 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when you work in a team you should know that others may not be agree with your ways and opposite
SI131R-00024-P50021 1 SI131R-00024 8.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but is good to express your ideas and know each other is basic to work in a team

SI131R-00024-P50022 1 SI131R-00024 1.84 14.54 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but i think it's better face to face than for example by email or video conference and that's because you can misunderstood on this ways
SI131R-00024-P50022 1 SI131R-00024 14.54 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and that's why i prefer face to face
SI131R-00024-P50023 1 SI131R-00024 0.00 8.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> from my point of view i agree with this people who think that there is better result working in a team
SI131R-00024-P50023 1 SI131R-00024 8.09 11.59 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) that's because everyone have faults
SI131R-00024-P50023 1 SI131R-00024 11.59 16.66 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) maybe in a team there is someone who can fill with other skills

SI131R-00030-P10007 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 8.69 <o,Q4,C,P1> (%hesitation%) it should be my mom because my mom is a mathematical teachers and i'm very interested in math
SI131R-00030-P10007 1 SI131R-00030 8.69 10.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> so we often study together

SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 14.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think a university student get a part time job (%hesitation%) it's a good choice because it can help them to accelerate their working (s-) experience
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 14.64 23.52 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it helps them to have a strong basement when they are facing problems or some troubles in the future
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 23.52 28.52 <o,Q4,B2,P3> what's more it can help them to improve their communicative skills
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 28.52 35.71 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it helps them to know how to communicate with the people (surrou-) surround around them
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 35.71 46.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantage is that maybe part time jobs will takes their time too much that they would wouldn't concentrate on (%hesitation%) on their study
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 46.63 54.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) universities should balance their time on (pa-) part time jobs and their studies
SI131R-00030-P30017 1 SI131R-00030 54.14 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> we should keep it in our (h-) heart and then make a better choice
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 6.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) here is an illustrating about how to travel by a plane
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 6.83 11.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first travel to airport by bus by taxi or by train
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 11.91 15.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after you arrive the airport you have to check in
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 15.87 22.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> make sure you have all the i d cards certificates visa and so on
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 22.10 27.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that and then you have to have your document controlled
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 27.76 33.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if you finished these steps then you will have security check
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 33.76 45.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (y-) (%hesitation%) make sure you don't (%hesitation%) take some (%hesitation%) threaten weapons like a knife and a shot or something
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 45.25 47.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you have to wait for a while
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 47.59 54.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that (%hesitation%) you when your flight is going to (fle-) (%hesitation%) flight take off you gotta abroad
SI131R-00030-P40018 1 SI131R-00030 54.99 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then just enjoying your flight

SI131R-00030-P50020 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 2.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with that
SI131R-00030-P50020 1 SI131R-00030 2.16 15.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) when you will have lessons face to face with teachers (%hesitation%) you will be more focused on your study and (%hesitation%) you would like to communicate with (s-) with your (s-) teachers about some questions

SI131R-00030-P50022 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 11.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think attending lectures would be a better because the professor and advisor will help you to point out your further study direction
SI131R-00030-P50022 1 SI131R-00030 11.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) they can help you to (%hesitation%) relax your stress from (s-) made by study or something
SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030 0.00 7.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) modern learning facilities (%hesitation%) could bring advanced knowledge around the world
SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030 7.45 15.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) students can use it for relaxation or (s-) of some useful information from the internet
SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030 15.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it's very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 6.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i believe that learning about other (cul-) other countries and their culture is very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045 6.62 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> since i am a teacher i consider to be (%hesitation%) really important because (%hesitation%) in this way you know the people and and how they (%hesitation%) how they work
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045 19.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> or they
SI131R-00045-P10006 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 10.27 <o,Q4,B2,P1> most of my free time i spend it with (%hesitation%) my family which with my wife (%hesitation%) my son and sometimes my parents
SI131R-00045-P10006 1 SI131R-00045 10.27 18.98 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) we have to (%hesitation%) have a nice night (%hesitation%) drinking a beer and maybe eating some pizza
SI131R-00045-P10006 1 SI131R-00045 18.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's a
SI131R-00045-P10007 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 15.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> from my perspective the best (%hesitation%) way to improve your english is to use it in a real (%hesitation%) way for example speaking with people whose first (%hesitation%) language is english for example
SI131R-00045-P10007 1 SI131R-00045 15.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i also like to use speak and improve (%hesitation%)
SI131R-00045-P10008 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 6.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i don't consider myself a good (%hesitation%) speaker in front of people
SI131R-00045-P10008 1 SI131R-00045 6.84 16.35 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so well being a teacher i consider it to be very very important to know how to deal with this fear (%hesitation%) this scenic fear
SI131R-00045-P10008 1 SI131R-00045 16.35 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (%hesitation%) in my perspective (%hesitation%) that's a good skill i could
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 11.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> having a part time job (%hesitation%) during our university studies (%hesitation%) can bring some advantages and some disadvantages
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 11.82 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disadvantage can could be that (%hesitation%) you can have less time to do your homework for example
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 20.88 44.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to the to the career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and in if it doesn't work you can (%hesitation%) learn from that (%hesitation%) experience
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 44.53 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) it's very important for students to have a part time job
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 51.24 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however this part time job must be related to their bachelor degrees so it will learn more
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 6.26 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is well known that rain is a natural phenomena
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 6.26 11.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) however factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 11.56 16.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this pollution is (%hesitation%) mainly acid particles in smoke
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 16.36 19.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 19.84 24.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> and some particles falls a dust as dust
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 24.63 48.99 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) on the other hand there're other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds (%hesitation%) producing water or snow (%hesitation%) make fall this (%hesitation%) acid particles over the the trees over the animals over even over of our cars
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 48.99 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this can be (%hesitation%) harmful and it damages the nature
SI131R-00045-P50019 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if you want to have (%hesitation%) good eating habits as in any other habit (%hesitation%) you need to be strength you need strength and you need discipline so you don't eat (%hesitation%) junk food and (%hesitation%) focus just in eating
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 11.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> since our bodies are conformed (%hesitation%) of ninety six percent of water it's very important that we drink water
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045 11.37 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however as you said before drinking lots of water maybe maybe can be very harmful
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 8.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner (%hesitation%) in this field
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045 8.06 15.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045 15.55 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and then you can go on and work harder
SI131R-00045-P50022 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 5.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my own perspective i consider that it depends on the person
SI131R-00045-P50022 1 SI131R-00045 5.89 10.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i sleep eight hours and that's enough for me
SI131R-00045-P50022 1 SI131R-00045 10.11 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however there are other people who needs ten hours and there are other people who needs just six hours and they are done
SI131R-00045-P50023 1 SI131R-00045 0.00 5.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i consider that technology indeed affect us
SI131R-00045-P50023 1 SI131R-00045 5.51 12.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) however i believe that it will affect you more the more you use it
SI131R-00045-P50023 1 SI131R-00045 12.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example people who pass all day (%hesitation%) watching their cell phone can be really (harm-)
SI131R-00048-P10005 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 18.76 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the place where i live it's really (%hesitation%) quiet at (%hesitation%) surrounding village and you have the possibility to to go to the centre of the city but you don't live there
SI131R-00048-P10005 1 SI131R-00048 18.76 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so
SI131R-00048-P10006 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 11.50 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i enjoy travelling that's the best activity that i (%hesitation%) can do with (%hesitation%) when i am on holidays
SI131R-00048-P10006 1 SI131R-00048 11.50 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> that's (%hesitation%) so important for me because i will like to know new places and new cultures
SI131R-00048-P10007 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 15.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending time with my sister because we can do a lot of (%hesitation%) physical activities and we do well we have the same (%hesitation%) interests
SI131R-00048-P10007 1 SI131R-00048 15.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so it's really easy to
SI131R-00048-P10008 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in the future i would like to work as a teacher because i study (%hesitation%) to be teacher and i really like to to be teacher in public education in spain
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 22.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think university students (%hesitation%) want to pay their own studies because it's really difficult for families to to get the amount of the money that you need to pay your studies
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 22.86 30.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so the advantage well you are independent of your family and are economically (%hesitation%) independent
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 30.31 40.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages are obviously you have (%hesitation%) less time to study so that's not good for your (%hesitation%) degree
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 40.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion for me it's more important the independence and not to be a charge for your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay your own studies
SI131R-00048-P40018 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 18.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all you have to travel to the airport airport so you could (%hesitation%) do this travel (%hesitation%) by train on a bus or by car
SI131R-00048-P40018 1 SI131R-00048 18.05 35.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and (%hesitation%) show your documentation because it's necessary to leave the country
SI131R-00048-P40018 1 SI131R-00048 35.23 42.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well you have to to pass the security control and then you have to wait

SI131R-00048-P40018 1 SI131R-00048 53.18 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well (%hesitation%) (af-) after you have to board and then
SI131R-00048-P50019 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 15.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00048-P50019 1 SI131R-00048 15.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they are (%hesitation%) tools to
SI131R-00048-P50021 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can develop (%hesitation%) social skills because they have to to reach an agreement and to be (%hesitation%) in some occasions (%hesitation%) empathic with their (%hesitation%) group
SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends because in some occasions when you attending lectures you learn a lot because the teacher (%hesitation%) it's good at (%hesitation%) his job
SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048 13.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in other locations attending lectures is not effective because it's the same that you read alone
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048 0.00 8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048 8.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's important to modernise your style of (%hesitation%) teach to be attractive (%hesitation%) for the students
SI131R-00058-P10005 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am interested in learning about (%hesitation%) foreign cultures
SI131R-00058-P10006 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy my free time (%hesitation%) playing baseball or travelling
SI131R-00058-P10007 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think the best way to improve my english skill is to communicate with foreign people in english
SI131R-00058-P30017 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 12.52 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of the advantage (%hesitation%) to do part time jobs is to learn about society
SI131R-00058-P30017 1 SI131R-00058 12.52 25.14 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) one of the (disadva-) disadvantage is (%hesitation%) to lose study (%hesitation%) in university
SI131R-00058-P30017 1 SI131R-00058 25.14 47.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) i was (%hesitation%) i did part time jobs in (gra-) (%hesitation%) gram school (%hesitation%) and i learn about (%hesitation%) society (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) importance of teaching anyone
SI131R-00058-P30017 1 SI131R-00058 47.20 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) i think all university students should do part time jobs
SI131R-00058-P40018 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 14.51 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first (%hesitation%) the smoke of pollution (%hesitation%) is emitted by vehicles and factories
SI131R-00058-P40018 1 SI131R-00058 14.51 23.75 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the acid particles are in smoke are carried by window
SI131R-00058-P40018 1 SI131R-00058 23.75 39.84 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) then some acid particles fall as dust (%hesitation%) in the ground (%hesitation%) and other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI131R-00058-P40018 1 SI131R-00058 39.84 49.08 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then (%hesitation%) acid particles are in rain or snow (%hesitation%) fall to the ground
SI131R-00058-P40018 1 SI131R-00058 49.08 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then (%hesitation%) they damage to environment
SI131R-00058-P50019 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 14.36 <o,Q5,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) you can eat (%hesitation%) breakfast so (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) it's a (%hesitation%) it's best
SI131R-00058-P50019 1 SI131R-00058 14.36 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it's most important eating
SI131R-00058-P50020 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 18.35 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it is (%hesitation%) important to drink water (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) drinking water makes us (%hesitation%) so healthy
SI131R-00058-P50020 1 SI131R-00058 18.35 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> and (%hesitation%)
SI131R-00058-P50021 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) it is important to do exercise every day because (%hesitation%) doing exercise makes me so healthy and (%hesitation%) ok
SI131R-00058-P50022 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think eight hours sleeping sleeping times is an essential (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) i think the next day working (%hesitation%) is active
SI131R-00058-P50023 1 SI131R-00058 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> (%hesitation%) that technology has a positive effect (%hesitation%) effect of (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) people (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) so so far i can't do then we can do

SI131R-00079-P10006 1 SI131R-00079 6.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) but always as i can i would like i like i love travelling and discover new place in the world with my family and friend
SI131R-00079-P10007 1 SI131R-00079 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> of all my family i i think i the the person who i have (%hesitation%) best moment is with my mother because we are (%hesitation%) pretty similar to the in the way that we speak
SI131R-00079-P10008 1 SI131R-00079 0.00 3.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to work in the receptions
SI131R-00079-P10008 1 SI131R-00079 3.23 13.53 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) so (%hesitation%) for it i'm learning language because i (%hesitation%) it's essential for this type of work
SI131R-00079-P10008 1 SI131R-00079 13.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and other good thing of this work is you meet with people from all over the world
SI131R-00079-P30017 1 SI131R-00079 0.00 12.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> not all the students (%hesitation%) have enough money (%hesitation%) to pay they needs (%hesitation%) during during university
SI131R-00079-P30017 1 SI131R-00079 12.40 31.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) if one advantage of get (%hesitation%) a jot is that they can have the enough money to to buy the things they they need during all the course
SI131R-00079-P30017 1 SI131R-00079 31.40 41.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) they don't have to to worry about how make (%hesitation%) ends meet
SI131R-00079-P30017 1 SI131R-00079 41.08 55.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other side (%hesitation%) disadvantage it could be that they don't have the same time to study (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%) other student that don't need (%hesitation%) a job
SI131R-00079-P30017 1 SI131R-00079 55.74 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think the best is have a job because you

SI131R-00079-P40018 1 SI131R-00079 24.53 32.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after all this (%hesitation%) you can wait (%hesitation%) in the room

SI131R-00079-P50020 1 SI131R-00079 0.00 7.67 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) from from my point of view it's (%hesitation%) a good way a really good way but no is the only
SI131R-00079-P50020 1 SI131R-00079 7.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) you can (ha-) it's you have it you if you have (%hesitation%) english friends for instance you can speak (%hesitation%) with him and it's really good too
SI131R-00079-P50021 1 SI131R-00079 0.00 18.42 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) work in group is a good option because every member of the group (%hesitation%) can help each other and they can collaborate between they

SI131R-00119-P10008 1 SI131R-00119 0.00 18.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in the future i would like to be a teacher (%hesitation%) an english teacher because i love (%hesitation%) being with young people and i love to to (%hesitation%) to teach (%hesitation%) languages to anyone

SI131R-00119-P30017 1 SI131R-00119 0.00 8.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> don't you see that student should get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI131R-00119-P30017 1 SI131R-00119 8.25 13.72 <o,Q4,C,P3> i absolutely agree that we have a lot of advantages for students
SI131R-00119-P30017 1 SI131R-00119 13.72 26.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> by getting a job they can experiment what a real job is and that practice will help them to choose a good (f-) a good job for the for the future

SI131R-00119-P30017 1 SI131R-00119 29.19 34.59 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) so having a job while you're studying can rest you time from studying
SI131R-00119-P30017 1 SI131R-00119 34.59 36.98 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you may have less free time

SI131R-00119-P40018 1 SI131R-00119 32.58 36.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> at last (%hesitation%) you do the board the boarding

SI131R-00119-P50021 1 SI131R-00119 17.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's what i think
SI131R-00119-P50022 1 SI131R-00119 0.00 15.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that attending lectures can be more effective than reading alone (%hesitation%) because you have to pay more attention (%hesitation%) to the person who is (%hesitation%) doing the lecture
SI131R-00119-P50022 1 SI131R-00119 15.58 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think (%hesitation%) that concentration will help you a lot
SI131R-00119-P50023 1 SI131R-00119 0.00 7.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it is very important for universities to provide (%hesitation%) learning facilities to students
SI131R-00119-P50023 1 SI131R-00119 7.07 18.56 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it can be a digital blackboard or tablets (%hesitation%) so the students can connect to internet and guess what they guessing about
SI131R-00119-P50023 1 SI131R-00119 18.56 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's very important
SI131R-00126-P10005 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> very interested because the environment is the only thing that we can preserve and it's important because there depends our
SI131R-00126-P10006 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> when i meet with my friends we like to go to the beach (%hesitation%) go to movies or go to eating at some restaurant
SI131R-00126-P10007 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 4.18 <o,Q4,B1,P1> think the most similar
SI131R-00126-P10007 1 SI131R-00126 4.18 5.85 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm the
SI131R-00126-P10007 1 SI131R-00126 5.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i have a lot of in common with my aunt because we share (%hesitation%) things that like to each other and hobbies

SI131R-00126-P10008 1 SI131R-00126 10.48 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i would like to move to canada because
SI131R-00126-P30017 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 31.38 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that advantage of the college and school make time making time for their students do fitness class are firstly the they can develop other skills and reforce other areas that not is it's necessary on the classroom
SI131R-00126-P30017 1 SI131R-00126 31.38 35.42 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the disadvantage are the cost i think
SI131R-00126-P30017 1 SI131R-00126 35.42 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in my opinion it's a good thing to do with the students because they could learn about and develop other skills and improve the

SI131R-00126-P40018 1 SI131R-00126 24.37 30.08 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) first bees the bees collect nectar from flowers
SI131R-00126-P40018 1 SI131R-00126 30.08 44.61 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then (%hesitation%) then they make honey from nectar in beehives and people that are in charge to collect (%hesitation%) the honey from beehives are the beekeepers
SI131R-00126-P40018 1 SI131R-00126 44.61 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then they sell to the (pro-) to the stores to for the human consume
SI131R-00126-P50019 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 15.84 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the most important thing to consider is the country when where you can develop professionally and you can learn about your career
SI131R-00126-P50019 1 SI131R-00126 15.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> other things is the people
SI131R-00126-P50020 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 15.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that there are many advantage or learning a second a thirdly a fourly language because it's important for the develop of your career and (o-) and your person
SI131R-00126-P50020 1 SI131R-00126 15.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and the advantages are
SI131R-00126-P50021 1 SI131R-00126 0.00 7.99 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the most difficult thing is be far away from your country
SI131R-00126-P50021 1 SI131R-00126 7.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and also the culture sometimes it could be (%hesitation%) difficult to

SI131R-00126-P50022 1 SI131R-00126 11.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because there are not other people that can explain how is their culture as

SI131R-00148-P10006 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 7.53 <o,Q4,B1,P1> two or three years ago when i was on holidays always i tried to travel
SI131R-00148-P10006 1 SI131R-00148 7.53 10.49 <o,Q4,B1,P1> my favourite place is the north of spain
SI131R-00148-P10006 1 SI131R-00148 10.49 15.62 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but right now with the coronavirus it's impossible to travel anywhere
SI131R-00148-P10006 1 SI131R-00148 15.62 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i (%hesitation%) i'm the time in my house
SI131R-00148-P10007 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 13.72 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i spend more time always with my daughter because she is not going to the school for the coronavirus at the moment so she is with me twenty four hours a day

SI131R-00148-P10008 1 SI131R-00148 5.47 9.40 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so for me the perfect work have that
SI131R-00148-P10008 1 SI131R-00148 9.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i want to work for the government to have (%hesitation%) stability and a good schedule only in the mornings
SI131R-00148-P30017 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 13.42 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages it could be that the job gives them a chance to put in practice skills they have learned in school
SI131R-00148-P30017 1 SI131R-00148 13.42 26.03 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the (%hesitation%) part time have disadvantages because the students could feel tired and don't enough time to study while doing part time work
SI131R-00148-P30017 1 SI131R-00148 26.03 35.61 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion is necessary to keep in mind the importance of a good balance between school work and part time jobs
SI131R-00148-P30017 1 SI131R-00148 35.61 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i'd rather study first and then work only on vacation in summer
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 13.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the diagram i can see how you have to go changing in the (%hesitation%) airport to travelling by airplanes
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 13.04 22.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first thing to travel to the airport is taking a bus or (%hesitation%) trailway or in a car
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 22.78 31.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> just there you can park the car or you can down of the bus and go to the exit way
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 31.25 39.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> later you have to check in your luggages or if you have a (la-) hand luggage is not necessary check in anything
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 39.55 49.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) then later you have to pass the document control with the police and the security
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 49.47 51.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> later you have to wait
SI131R-00148-P40018 1 SI131R-00148 51.33 60.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can drink a coffee and later you have to go to board to your gate and then travel in the (ai-)
SI131R-00148-P50019 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 9.34 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the use of technological tools motivates and makes it easier for students to hold they attention
SI131R-00148-P50019 1 SI131R-00148 9.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to be more effectivility (%hesitation%) they could be funnier learning technology
SI131R-00148-P50020 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it's better face to face than online classes because (%hesitation%) when you are with a teacher in front on you it's better the concentration and you can learn better
SI131R-00148-P50021 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B1,P5> they could separate the the projects in for example if they are three they can do it apart for each one
SI131R-00148-P50021 1 SI131R-00148 13.14 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and that one is (%hesitation%) the owner of that part
SI131R-00148-P50022 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 14.27 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion it's better reading alone than attending lectures with more people because when you are alone (%hesitation%) the concentration is bigger than in a group
SI131R-00148-P50022 1 SI131R-00148 14.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so for me it's better read alone
SI131R-00148-P50023 1 SI131R-00148 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very important improve the facilities of the universities to learn better for example with new computers and everything to be better for the teachers and the students
SI131R-00151-P10005 1 SI131R-00151 0.00 12.98 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really love to learn about more countries and specific more about europe (%hesitation%) their culture about their food about their language about almost everything
SI131R-00151-P10005 1 SI131R-00151 12.98 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that it's very interest (%hesitation%) to know about their history
SI131R-00151-P10006 1 SI131R-00151 0.00 4.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> to be honest i don't have like a lot of free time

SI131R-00151-P10007 1 SI131R-00151 0.00 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) the best way to improve my english is not by studying if not (%hesitation%) by practicing (%hesitation%) speaking with another with other people and also watching series in netflix in english
SI131R-00151-P10008 1 SI131R-00151 0.00 11.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i could learn another skill maybe (%hesitation%) i will choose learning french and german
SI131R-00151-P10008 1 SI131R-00151 11.87 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> this is because the entire world well almost the entire world speaks those languages
SI131R-00151-P30017 1 SI131R-00151 0.00 7.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as we can know there are many students that also have a part time job
SI131R-00151-P30017 1 SI131R-00151 7.69 12.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> part time jobs have advantages and disadvantages
SI131R-00151-P30017 1 SI131R-00151 12.06 25.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but first advantages we can see that people who make (%hesitation%) internships can make a little more of mistakes than full time job workers
SI131R-00151-P30017 1 SI131R-00151 25.00 33.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and also this help to meet more people in many departments so they can take in mind those tasks
SI131R-00151-P30017 1 SI131R-00151 33.92 48.33 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however in the part of disadvantages (%hesitation%) the people who may have a part time job are not very concentrated on the job or in the school

SI131R-00274-P10005 1 SI131R-00274 6.78 16.67 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i really hate (%hesitation%) my town because it has no shops no cinemas (%hesitation%) hardly anything
SI131R-00274-P10005 1 SI131R-00274 16.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have to go to granada to (w-) meet with my (fr-)
SI131R-00274-P10006 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 10.81 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well as i usually (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) fail my final exams my (%hesitation%) summer holidays tends to (%hesitation%) start very late
SI131R-00274-P10006 1 SI131R-00274 10.81 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so when it comes by mid of july i really like to do nothing like stay in bed all day
SI131R-00274-P10007 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 15.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well although it can sounds (%hesitation%) a little bit evil i really don't like to spend so much time with any of my (%hesitation%) family because (%hesitation%) they can be so annoying sometimes
SI131R-00274-P10007 1 SI131R-00274 15.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i prefer to stay alone or with my friend
SI131R-00274-P10008 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 8.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so as a physic student i really like to work in the future probably in the nasa
SI131R-00274-P10008 1 SI131R-00274 8.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but i think is too difficult so i see myself working (%hesitation%) in a telescope for example with other physics partner
SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 13.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well at one hand i think that it could be a really good option for student because by that they are gonna have experience
SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 13.54 22.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in their (f-) in future they can add it on their cvs so enterprise (%hesitation%) contract thems
SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 22.76 38.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) on the other hand i think that a student (%hesitation%) if you are at university your main (f-) (%hesitation%) objective is to study and to get your degree
SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 38.22 48.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if you are working obviously you aren't gonna have the the total time to dedicate to your career
SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 48.04 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and probably you are gonna fail some subjects or anything like that
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 8.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so if you're gonna travel by airplane first of all you have to obviously go to the airport
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 8.31 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> depending of the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or (%hesitation%) by your own or taxi or your own car
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 21.38 32.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so once there you have to go to the to the your company gate and do the and check your luggage
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 32.25 47.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to pass the security control (%hesitation%) where a policeman (%hesitation%) control your passport and your i d and check your luggage
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 47.47 58.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you pass the security control probably you are you have go you have to wait in a waiting room or you can go to a cafe
SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 58.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to (boa-)
SI131R-00274-P50019 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 12.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example i have an ipad so when i am not in the mood for being studied (%hesitation%) i would prefer to stay in bed but as i say i have to study
SI131R-00274-P50019 1 SI131R-00274 12.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes being warming being warm in my bed
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 7.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well obviously it depend of the teacher and the subject that are you studying
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274 7.30 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in my own experience i will say that i prefer (%hesitation%) a book rather than a teacher
SI131R-00274-P50021 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 7.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so first of all if you work in groups (%hesitation%) you'll have to deal with people
SI131R-00274-P50021 1 SI131R-00274 7.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so you could (%hesitation%) develop your (empha-) empathy or sympathy (s-) skills (%hesitation%) being nice to other people
SI131R-00274-P50022 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 6.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as i said earlier it will depend it would depend on the subject
SI131R-00274-P50022 1 SI131R-00274 6.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> on my own experience it's preferable to (%hesitation%) read a book alone because most of my teacher are unexperience teaching students
SI131R-00274-P50023 1 SI131R-00274 0.00 5.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in my opinion it is a very important matter
SI131R-00274-P50023 1 SI131R-00274 5.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) in my faculty for example they have updated all the the p cs and they have (%hesitation%) designed (%hesitation%) a three d printer for everyone

SI131R-00276-P10006 1 SI131R-00276 3.67 6.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> is my main hobby i think
SI131R-00276-P10006 1 SI131R-00276 6.58 14.96 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i i try to find the best prices the the best offer to travel
SI131R-00276-P10006 1 SI131R-00276 14.96 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i always travel one once (%hesitation%) for my holiday
SI131R-00276-P10007 1 SI131R-00276 0.00 14.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i prefer stay with my brother (%hesitation%) because we have a lot of things on common and (%hesitation%) he's very funny in my opinion (%hesitation%) like me
SI131R-00276-P10007 1 SI131R-00276 14.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and yeah i love this this boy
SI131R-00276-P10008 1 SI131R-00276 0.00 3.78 <o,Q5,B2,P1> yeah i studied chemistry
SI131R-00276-P10008 1 SI131R-00276 3.78 4.66 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm chemist
SI131R-00276-P10008 1 SI131R-00276 4.66 18.99 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i would like (%hesitation%) something about chemist but (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) try to to research some something important and something about environment
SI131R-00276-P10008 1 SI131R-00276 18.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think is
SI131R-00276-P30017 1 SI131R-00276 0.00 15.26 <o,Q4,B1,P3> my opinion the main advantage about (%hesitation%) get jobs (%hesitation%) to pay your university studies (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) you can help your family to pay these studies
SI131R-00276-P30017 1 SI131R-00276 15.26 28.45 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) your parents can't support (%hesitation%) all the cost (%hesitation%) of of studies usually at least (%hesitation%) (i-) in spain
SI131R-00276-P30017 1 SI131R-00276 28.45 30.44 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) the main disadvantage is the time
SI131R-00276-P30017 1 SI131R-00276 30.44 38.55 <o,Q4,B1,P3> it (%hesitation%) difficult to have the same (%hesitation%) qualification the same marks with a job

SI131R-00276-P40018 1 SI131R-00276 3.37 6.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you have to travel to airport
SI131R-00276-P40018 1 SI131R-00276 6.72 18.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then in the airport you you (l-) (l-) should look for (%hesitation%) people (%hesitation%) staff to do (%hesitation%) the check in
SI131R-00276-P40018 1 SI131R-00276 18.70 34.08 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then when you do the check in you and you passed the document control and the security (%hesitation%) you are (%hesitation%) ok to to board in the aeroplane
SI131R-00276-P40018 1 SI131R-00276 34.08 46.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) so if you have time you you you could wait (%hesitation%) and take a coffee or (%hesitation%) or buy a gift
SI131R-00276-P40018 1 SI131R-00276 46.21 50.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you board and start your your journey

SI131R-00276-P50019 1 SI131R-00276 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion technology could be very useful (%hesitation%) for students because (%hesitation%) he they want to use application on mobile phone or the (%hesitation%) laptop to to improve (%hesitation%) their way (%hesitation%) to study

SI131R-00276-P50020 1 SI131R-00276 10.53 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but (%hesitation%) nowadays (%hesitation%) maybe with technology is enough in a lot of ways to learn

SI131R-00276-P50023 1 SI131R-00276 0.00 20.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it's very important (%hesitation%) learning facilities for student because they need (%hesitation%) to the university is like (%hesitation%) one door to the real life and they need a lot of (%hesitation%) facilities to to work and to life
SI131R-00282-P10005 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 7.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i love the traditions and different cultures and i'm so interesting in that

SI131R-00282-P10008 1 SI131R-00282 19.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> talking
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 5.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 5.62 23.99 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages for that is the most important that they will get more experience for their future jobs but and they can earn money for go shopping with friends
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 23.99 24.73 <o,Q5,B2,P3> anyways
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 24.73 47.94 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they could don't have time to study because the university sometimes is very difficult and they could be stressed for for the jobs while they're (st-) they are studying
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 47.94 58.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> my opinion well i would like to (stu-) to have a job but while i'm studying but i don't want to be stressed
SI131R-00282-P30017 1 SI131R-00282 58.41 60.04 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i don't
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 9.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we know that the the pollution the air pollutions comes from factories and vehicles
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 9.46 18.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so this pollution go up and make acid particles that are in smoke
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 18.29 23.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and these acid particles are carried by wind
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 23.23 32.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that makes that they could with mix with other particles
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 32.34 37.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and some acid particles fall as dust in the world
SI131R-00282-P40018 1 SI131R-00282 37.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so acid particles are in rain snow normally and that (pro-) provokes the damage to environment
SI131R-00282-P50019 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 11.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all they should drink a lot of water it's too important and eat a lot of fruits
SI131R-00282-P50019 1 SI131R-00282 11.70 20.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's so important because these fruits have the proteins and vitamins that our body needs
SI131R-00282-P50020 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as i said before drinking water it's very important for us because the water gives our body like energy these this good benefits that the water have us
SI131R-00282-P50021 1 SI131R-00282 0.00 5.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's very good to do exercise every day a little bit
SI131R-00282-P50021 1 SI131R-00282 5.79 14.28 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but you you have to have a routine and and do a little bit for example fifteen minutes per day

SI131R-00286-P10006 1 SI131R-00286 17.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and
SI131R-00286-P10007 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 5.17 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i can't choose one person of my whole family
SI131R-00286-P10007 1 SI131R-00286 5.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) however if i have to say just one i could say my cousin because we are the same age and we have been our whole life together
SI131R-00286-P10008 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 11.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to be an international lawyer (%hesitation%) because i am deciding which field of law is more accurate for me
SI131R-00286-P10008 1 SI131R-00286 11.16 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think i will like to solve international (%hesitation%) problems or international issues
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 14.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in the one hand work for paying the university studies (%hesitation%) provide you to be finally independent
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 14.65 18.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you can manage manage your own money
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 18.53 30.01 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you can decide (%hesitation%) for what are you going you are going to spend or you are (ma-) you are going to manage your own money
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 30.01 36.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the other hand as a disadvantage you have to work at the same time at you are studying
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 36.80 43.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and maybe you don't you are not going to have (%hesitation%) free time or enough time for you
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 43.49 56.85 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on my own opinion is really important working while you are studying because you can appreciate (%hesitation%) the free time and the the effort
SI131R-00286-P30017 1 SI131R-00286 56.85 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (yo-)
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 3.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about travelling by airplane
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 3.60 16.90 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so when you have a flight you have to travel (%hesitation%) you have to go to the airport and you have (%hesitation%) many different ways to go there (%hesitation%) which is car bus or train
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 16.90 27.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you arrive to the airport you have to check in your your document your document control as for for instance passport i d
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 27.56 36.62 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and then you have to pass the control the security control to avoid you have (%hesitation%) provided things with you
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 36.62 42.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and maybe you have to wait just (%hesitation%) five ten minutes
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 42.74 45.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you can stay at the restaurant
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 45.38 50.74 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you have (%hesitation%) to board (%hesitation%) in the airplane
SI131R-00286-P40018 1 SI131R-00286 50.74 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and we when is going to be the time the airplane takes (o-)
SI131R-00286-P50019 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 8.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> so technology is an important tool to learn a lot of a lot of things
SI131R-00286-P50019 1 SI131R-00286 8.04 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i think it's really important that students have the opportunity to access to the internet to google and
SI131R-00286-P50020 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 12.69 <o,Q4,C,P5> in on my opinion the teacher has to teach (%hesitation%) face to face because a student or the teacher can provide more information more knowledge
SI131R-00286-P50020 1 SI131R-00286 12.69 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i think the student (%hesitation%) acquire more (knowled-)
SI131R-00286-P50021 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 9.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think the most important skill students have to have is to communicate and organize
SI131R-00286-P50021 1 SI131R-00286 9.95 17.05 <o,Q4,C,P5> organisation is really important to to create an amazing project
SI131R-00286-P50021 1 SI131R-00286 17.05 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and at the same time is really important
SI131R-00286-P50022 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 9.78 <o,Q4,C,P5> in my opinion (%hesitation%) attending lectures can be (%hesitation%) perjudicial for the (st-) students
SI131R-00286-P50022 1 SI131R-00286 9.78 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> because if you are reading alone you are not get (distrac-) distracted (%hesitation%) despite
SI131R-00286-P50023 1 SI131R-00286 0.00 18.42 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's really important to provide learning facilities because the student can be more concentrated on the matter because he has the facilities
SI131R-00286-P50023 1 SI131R-00286 18.42 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and
SI131R-00291-P10005 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 4.25 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really appreciate the environment where we live
SI131R-00291-P10005 1 SI131R-00291 4.25 12.17 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think that i personally feel that all of us should look after our land
SI131R-00291-P10005 1 SI131R-00291 12.17 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and sh i firmly believe that if each of one do its part we will get better
SI131R-00291-P10006 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 7.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we have a very soft sport spot for watching series together
SI131R-00291-P10006 1 SI131R-00291 7.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> however i would i prefer watching films on netflix to watch series together because i really really appreciate my time
SI131R-00291-P10007 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i have to admit that by far the the people which i am really similar to is my mother because our face is quite similar and also when we (s-) when we are speaking sometimes people are confusing our voices because they are so similar
SI131R-00291-P10008 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 5.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i was a child i used to think that i would like to live in london
SI131R-00291-P10008 1 SI131R-00291 5.97 16.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> however actually i am used to to living in a little town like for example now in brazil or (%hesitation%) before in poland
SI131R-00291-P10008 1 SI131R-00291 16.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really like small towns
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 6.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> so let's begin by speaking about the advantages of this idea
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 6.04 19.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i firmly believe that (%hesitation%) taking a short time per day to have some exercise would would be a really good benefit for students to to being active
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 19.41 32.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> and as well there there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will miss (%hesitation%) time for for doing their lessons like for example science
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 32.14 39.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> and another parts would be that that's maybe some students down don't want to to do exercise
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 39.02 42.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> so they will lost time at the school
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 42.22 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but (%hesitation%) although all this advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea it's really good and it should be recognized by schools and schools should take part to get go ahead
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 9.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so well today i'm (ta-) i will talk about how bees produce (%hesitation%) honey
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 9.05 17.44 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so let's begin by (s-) by by talk that bees collect nectar from flowers outside
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 17.44 29.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in beehives
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 29.42 37.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after all of that there is there is a human part where beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 37.76 47.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the same person puts the honey in different bottles and that's all i have to say in this production part
SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 47.22 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after this enter the transportation part where a truck (%hesitation%) leave the the the honey to a supermarket and there they are sell
SI131R-00291-P50019 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 9.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00291-P50019 1 SI131R-00291 9.45 13.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) how many the rent (co-) is the rent cost
SI131R-00291-P50019 1 SI131R-00291 13.95 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> how many would cost the alimentation there and all this stuff
SI131R-00291-P50020 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 6.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> studying in a second language would be could help you to improve your abilities to speak another language
SI131R-00291-P50020 1 SI131R-00291 6.85 13.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and this will will also be too much useful when you wanted to get a new job for example
SI131R-00291-P50020 1 SI131R-00291 13.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> because the most you know the (m-) the more you know the more you understand the world
SI131R-00291-P50021 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 4.81 <o,Q4,B2,P5> this is a very difficult question because depend of the students
SI131R-00291-P50021 1 SI131R-00291 4.81 9.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00291-P50021 1 SI131R-00291 9.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i firmly believe that one of the (mo-) (%hesitation%) one of the hardest difficulties would be a new language or even a new rituals or (cult-)
SI131R-00291-P50022 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 14.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> firstly if the students want to know something about local culture they should they should go into traditional parties for example or ask or ask to local people there
SI131R-00291-P50022 1 SI131R-00291 14.26 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and secondly (%hesitation%) the students should get more information about
SI131R-00291-P50023 1 SI131R-00291 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i have to confess that i'm i totally agree with that statement because i believe that all people need one moment in their life to feel comfortable with their self and to develop their independence
SI131R-00335-P10005 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 3.63 <o,Q5,C,P1> i live in a three bedroom house
SI131R-00335-P10005 1 SI131R-00335 3.63 7.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> it is located at slap bang in the city centre
SI131R-00335-P10005 1 SI131R-00335 7.70 11.21 <o,Q5,C,P1> and it is very nice and cosy house
SI131R-00335-P10005 1 SI131R-00335 11.21 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i love to stay at home rather than going out in current scenario of (%hesitation%) virus
SI131R-00335-P10006 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 6.09 <o,Q5,C,P1> so holiday is a part of life which i never want to miss
SI131R-00335-P10006 1 SI131R-00335 6.09 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and when i am in holiday i love to do tracking and capture scenic views of (%hesitation%) landscapes which is one of my favourite hobby as well
SI131R-00335-P10007 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 3.78 <o,Q5,C,P1> okay so this is a tricky question
SI131R-00335-P10007 1 SI131R-00335 3.78 9.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> but (%hesitation%) to my knowledge i really love to enjoy with my son
SI131R-00335-P10007 1 SI131R-00335 9.31 18.34 <o,Q5,C,P1> he is just one year old and all the day i love to enjoy his naughtiness and playing with him with different kind of games
SI131R-00335-P10007 1 SI131R-00335 18.34 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i love to see
SI131R-00335-P10008 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 7.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> (%hesitation%) talking about the job i would love to do a teaching job
SI131R-00335-P10008 1 SI131R-00335 7.00 16.93 <o,Q5,C,P1> even i was doing teaching job but it would be great if i help someone to achieve their dreams through teaching
SI131R-00335-P10008 1 SI131R-00335 16.93 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i feel myself improved as (we-)
SI131R-00335-P30017 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 17.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> according to my opinion (s-) (s-) nowadays students should do the part time job in order to pay for their (st-) university studies which may help to broaden their horizon in terms of new skill which helps them boost their personality
SI131R-00335-P30017 1 SI131R-00335 17.99 29.67 <o,Q4,C,P3> besides this they can learn tremendous skills in terms of teamwork which is helpful to boost their personality and that might be helpful in studies as well
SI131R-00335-P30017 1 SI131R-00335 29.67 42.80 <o,Q4,C,P3> talking about the cons of this is just one in (%hesitation%) in my knowledge there is just one (%hesitation%) disadvantages of the job which is devoting less time towards the study
SI131R-00335-P30017 1 SI131R-00335 42.80 47.85 <o,Q4,C,P3> but overall (i-) it have lot of advantages over the disadvantages
SI131R-00335-P30017 1 SI131R-00335 47.85 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so i agree that doing part time jobs are very better than doing just only studies
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 9.18 <o,Q4,C,P4> thinks first of all we need to travel to airport by bus train or public transport
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 9.18 11.03 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can use any mode of them
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 11.03 15.51 <o,Q4,C,P4> then after reaching the airport you can check in at the check in counter
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 15.51 19.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> after the check in the it will proceed to document control
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 19.38 29.27 <o,Q4,C,P4> there all your document including your visa passports are being checked by the officer followed by security who will do the security check for you
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 29.27 34.17 <o,Q4,C,P4> then all of these things are done then you have to wait until you get bored
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 34.17 39.07 <o,Q4,C,P4> after waiting for a couple of hours then you are ready to board the flight
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 39.07 44.25 <o,Q4,C,P4> after boarding the flight it will take off and then it will led to your destination
SI131R-00335-P40018 1 SI131R-00335 44.25 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00335-P50019 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 10.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in this day and age we have lots of resources to use like technology internet which can be used to study and learn
SI131R-00335-P50019 1 SI131R-00335 10.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for according to me one can learn from internet because there are plenty of things on the internet to learn and study
SI131R-00335-P50020 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 8.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i fully agree with this statement let that face to face learning is the best option because we can get feedback at the time
SI131R-00335-P50020 1 SI131R-00335 8.79 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and even by learning face to face we can get all the answers of our queries or questions from the tutor
SI131R-00335-P50021 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 7.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it helps it helps to build a lot of skills including team skills communication skills
SI131R-00335-P50021 1 SI131R-00335 7.39 13.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it leads to extend our ideas by very worst
SI131R-00335-P50021 1 SI131R-00335 13.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> first of all people can
SI131R-00335-P50022 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 6.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion attending lectures are more effective than reading alone
SI131R-00335-P50022 1 SI131R-00335 6.83 10.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one may get bored by reading alone and may fall asleep
SI131R-00335-P50022 1 SI131R-00335 10.46 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but attending lecture make make its curiosity more and more to learn more
SI131R-00335-P50023 1 SI131R-00335 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is extremely important for the university to get updated with the learning facilities like superfast internet and p cs laptops and all these (%hesitation%) these technological devices which are needed for students to help learn and study more
SI131R-00345-P10005 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> used to see in internet or look (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) some books
SI131R-00345-P10006 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> i like to do sports or exercise (%hesitation%) ride to bicycle and read (%hesitation%) books or comics
SI131R-00345-P10007 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> i can (%hesitation%) speak english with my boyfriend or with (%hesitation%) friends
SI131R-00345-P10008 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,A2,P1> i like to be invisible
SI131R-00345-P30017 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 17.35 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the all university students all do part time job is (%hesitation%) the advantage is (%hesitation%) i win (%hesitation%) a lot of money
SI131R-00345-P30017 1 SI131R-00345 17.35 41.45 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) the time for student is very short and is difficult (%hesitation%) approbing the exam
SI131R-00345-P30017 1 SI131R-00345 41.45 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> my opinion (%hesitation%) is the bad (i-) bad idea the study and and work (%hesitation%) because no (t-) no time for
SI131R-00345-P40018 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 13.69 <o,Q4,A2,P4> the the acid is carry by pollution and up in the air
SI131R-00345-P40018 1 SI131R-00345 13.69 21.99 <o,Q4,A2,P4> the acid partic are are in smoke and the acid particles are carried by wind
SI131R-00345-P40018 1 SI131R-00345 21.99 30.18 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) some acid particle fall on dust and the human
SI131R-00345-P40018 1 SI131R-00345 30.18 54.13 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) and the acid partic are in rain and snow and damage the environment because is very dangerous
SI131R-00345-P40018 1 SI131R-00345 54.13 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) and the human (%hesitation%)
SI131R-00345-P50020 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 13.63 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i drinking water is very important (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) my body needs a a water
SI131R-00345-P50020 1 SI131R-00345 13.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i could not live (%hesitation%) without water
SI131R-00345-P50021 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 10.08 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion it is necessary to do sport every days because the body is healthy
SI131R-00345-P50021 1 SI131R-00345 10.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and the body need (%hesitation%) need
SI131R-00345-P50022 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that you have for sleep seven or eight hour in order to have a rested body and a full battery
SI131R-00345-P50023 1 SI131R-00345 0.00 13.44 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the technology is very is very good because i help for running
SI131R-00345-P50023 1 SI131R-00345 13.44 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i help for
SI131R-00372-P10005 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 8.83 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i live in a big flat which is near to the centre of the town
SI131R-00372-P10005 1 SI131R-00372 8.83 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
SI131R-00372-P10006 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really like spending time with my friends going for a work walk or listen to music sometimes watching a film or reading (%hesitation%) an interesting book you know
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 3.45 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my only brother
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372 3.45 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> he's very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic
SI131R-00372-P10008 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would love to be a teacher because i really like teaching kids and (%hesitation%) i'm also like to have you know (%hesitation%) really long holidays in summer
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 17.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think that one of the advantages is that if you don't have (%hesitation%) a lot of time to study you concentrate (%hesitation%) better and (%hesitation%) your time is more effective
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 17.20 17.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you know
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 17.95 27.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) on the other hand (%hesitation%) you will be exhausted (%hesitation%) with no time for your friends
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 27.38 34.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you're studying
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 34.65 47.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my (op-) opinion (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) if you can don't work at the same time but (%hesitation%) sometimes life (%hesitation%) challenge us
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 47.67 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so why i can tell you go for it and study and work like (%hesitation%) is the best thing you do
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 8.64 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you want to travelling by plane there are a few step steps that you need to know
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 8.64 24.20 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all (%hesitation%) you have to go to the airport (%hesitation%) in some transport transport like by car or by bus or train
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 24.20 40.84 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you arrived to the airport and it's time to do the check in pass through document control and then (s-) the security wards will see if everything is okay
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 40.84 43.57 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you have to wait in the waiting room
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 43.57 51.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you can eat something or go to the bathroom or restroom or take a coffee (%hesitation%) drink a coffee
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 51.10 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and finally (%hesitation%) they will call you on board and it's time to take off the plane
SI131R-00372-P50019 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 13.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so they can (%hesitation%) search information (%hesitation%) in the internet to improve their knowledge
SI131R-00372-P50019 1 SI131R-00372 13.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and then they can also join another clubs to
SI131R-00372-P50020 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 12.27 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think it's more more special you know because the teacher can ask your doubts in the moment
SI131R-00372-P50020 1 SI131R-00372 12.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but nowadays i think we have to to focus on the online
SI131R-00372-P50021 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 17.72 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they will learn how to work (%hesitation%) together and (%hesitation%) to don't don't have always the their opinion the right opinion and share responsibilities also
SI131R-00372-P50021 1 SI131R-00372 17.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's very good
SI131R-00372-P50022 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think when (%hesitation%) someone (%hesitation%) lectures you (%hesitation%) you will caught capt more information than by yourself and then later you can read alone everything to understand it
SI131R-00372-P50023 1 SI131R-00372 0.00 5.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's on the top now of everything
SI131R-00372-P50023 1 SI131R-00372 5.19 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if you want your students to be the best you have to provide them you know ways of learning (%hesitation%) and facilities that will be able
SI131R-00374-P10005 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 1.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> very interested
SI131R-00374-P10005 1 SI131R-00374 1.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> unfortunately i don't have money to travel but but i am very interested in learning at for about other countries cultures and languages
SI131R-00374-P10006 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 1.68 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like reading
SI131R-00374-P10006 1 SI131R-00374 1.68 2.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like listening to music
SI131R-00374-P10006 1 SI131R-00374 2.97 5.87 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like watching tv and netflix
SI131R-00374-P10006 1 SI131R-00374 5.87 9.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like (%hesitation%) cooking too
SI131R-00374-P10006 1 SI131R-00374 9.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like (de-) making desserts for my family
SI131R-00374-P10007 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 3.92 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for me is listening to music and watching cartoons
SI131R-00374-P10007 1 SI131R-00374 3.92 9.56 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i watch a lot of cartoons and i listen to lots of music in english
SI131R-00374-P10007 1 SI131R-00374 9.56 12.28 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and for me that's the best way for me obviously
SI131R-00374-P10007 1 SI131R-00374 12.28 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for other people there's a different way to that
SI131R-00374-P10008 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 6.01 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think i would like to learn other languages like really just other languages
SI131R-00374-P10008 1 SI131R-00374 6.01 7.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am fascinated by that
SI131R-00374-P10008 1 SI131R-00374 7.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 5.53 <o,Q3,B2,P3> talking about university students and part time jobs they should be doing that
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 5.53 12.58 <o,Q3,B2,P3> i mean one of the advantages are they would know the outside world as it is itself
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 12.58 17.43 <o,Q3,B2,P3> disadvantage would be that they wouldn't have time to focus on their studies
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 17.43 18.74 <o,Q3,B2,P3> that's what they should be doing
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 18.74 23.55 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but in my own opinion most of the students there are not able to pay for college
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 23.55 25.64 <o,Q3,B2,P3> they are already doing part time jobs
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 25.64 30.31 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so if everyone did it would be just you know fair to everyone
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 30.31 33.16 <o,Q3,B2,P3> everyone would know the world as it is itself
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 33.16 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P3> and everyone would have disadvantages of not having a hundred percent of your time to focus on studying
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 3.31 <o,Q3,B2,P4> acid rain is really easy to understand
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 3.31 4.08 <o,Q3,B2,P4> hear me out
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 4.08 6.93 <o,Q3,B2,P4> factories and vehicles they produce smoke
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 6.93 13.27 <o,Q3,B2,P4> and into the smoke they're acid particles that they flow and they are carried by the wind
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 13.27 18.04 <o,Q3,B2,P4> some of these acid particles can fall as dust and they cause damage to the environment
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 18.04 23.25 <o,Q3,B2,P4> other (%hesitation%) acid particles the more light ones they are mixed with cloud water
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 23.25 33.28 <o,Q3,B2,P4> so when this water in the clouds they precipitate (%hesitation%) as (%hesitation%) rain or snow (%hesitation%) is not just water or snow that is raining
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 33.28 36.62 <o,Q3,B2,P4> is water and snow or snow plus acid
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 36.62 40.42 <o,Q3,B2,P4> so it causes a lots of damage to the environment
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 40.42 60.00 <o,Q3,B2,P4> is really easy
SI131R-00374-P50019 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 3.04 <o,Q3,B2,P5> first of all look for a nutritionists
SI131R-00374-P50019 1 SI131R-00374 3.04 8.83 <o,Q3,B2,P5> if they are good they are going to give you a really good (%hesitation%) system that you can work with
SI131R-00374-P50019 1 SI131R-00374 8.83 12.11 <o,Q3,B2,P5> and there will be close to what you're used to
SI131R-00374-P50019 1 SI131R-00374 12.11 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> and you will create the habit of reading good things
SI131R-00374-P50020 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 1.93 <o,Q4,B2,P5> very important
SI131R-00374-P50020 1 SI131R-00374 1.93 5.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> our body is made of seventy percent of water
SI131R-00374-P50020 1 SI131R-00374 5.94 10.17 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if you don't drink enough water how can your body keep itself together
SI131R-00374-P50020 1 SI131R-00374 10.17 10.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it just can't
SI131R-00374-P50020 1 SI131R-00374 10.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so drink a lots of water people
SI131R-00374-P50021 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 3.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> not everyday but at least two to three times a week
SI131R-00374-P50021 1 SI131R-00374 3.84 11.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) exercise that good for your health that good for your body so you have to keep your body functioning good and exercise are going to do (%hesitation%) going to help with that
SI131R-00374-P50021 1 SI131R-00374 11.90 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so do it at least two to three times a week
SI131R-00374-P50022 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 1.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i totally agree
SI131R-00374-P50022 1 SI131R-00374 1.71 7.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) it is on our sleep then our body recovers our energy that our metabolisms work better
SI131R-00374-P50022 1 SI131R-00374 7.66 15.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so is on our sleep that we know we our body functions (a-) you know recycling themselves
SI131R-00374-P50022 1 SI131R-00374 15.21 17.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so sleep eight hours people
SI131R-00374-P50022 1 SI131R-00374 17.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is very
SI131R-00374-P50023 1 SI131R-00374 0.00 6.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think technology is a tool and as a tool can be used as a positive and a negative (%hesitation%) effect
SI131R-00374-P50023 1 SI131R-00374 6.95 9.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so in this case it might had a negative effect
SI131R-00374-P50023 1 SI131R-00374 9.46 10.93 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it's not technology fault
SI131R-00374-P50023 1 SI131R-00374 10.93 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's people's
SI131R-00441-P10005 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 12.63 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am so (int-) really interesting in (environ-) on environment because we are (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) we have the responsibility of the (w-) world
SI131R-00441-P10005 1 SI131R-00441 12.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's so important we we state
SI131R-00441-P10006 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 15.98 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really really like going to the cinema with them because we laugh very much very much and then we can speak about the film we have just (%hesitation%) see
SI131R-00441-P10006 1 SI131R-00441 15.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i like it so much
SI131R-00441-P10007 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i think (%hesitation%) my husband (%hesitation%) is similar to me because we understand the (o-) each other (%hesitation%) and we laughed (%hesitation%) very much together and we think many (th-) many things (%hesitation%) similar
SI131R-00441-P10008 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 12.67 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like (%hesitation%) to live in in london for example because i would like to to learn (%hesitation%) english the english language
SI131R-00441-P10008 1 SI131R-00441 12.67 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i think in spanish in spain is so difficult to to speak it
SI131R-00441-P30017 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 10.36 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think the advantages (%hesitation%) (i-) are for example that it is necessary to the health (%hesitation%) to our health
SI131R-00441-P30017 1 SI131R-00441 10.36 26.65 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) the disadvantages (i-) (%hesitation%) are (becau-) (%hesitation%) for example that (%hesitation%) we we can (%hesitation%) do fitness (%hesitation%) out of the classes of schools and college
SI131R-00441-P30017 1 SI131R-00441 26.65 39.03 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) i think the students can do (%hesitation%) every every fitness classes in the gym out of the school
SI131R-00441-P30017 1 SI131R-00441 39.03 47.84 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion i think is so important (%hesitation%) the fitness the exercise the sports
SI131R-00441-P30017 1 SI131R-00441 47.84 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and and (i-) it could (%hesitation%) be possible that you (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) try (%hesitation%) fitness classes

SI131R-00441-P40018 1 SI131R-00441 51.13 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and in the shop (%hesitation%) the customer (%hesitation%) buy them
SI131R-00441-P50019 1 SI131R-00441 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> well i think students (%hesitation%) choosing a country (%hesitation%) like a london because they look at the party and the university it was (%hesitation%) ok

SI131R-00447-P10005 1 SI131R-00447 9.73 20.00 <o,Q3,B1,P1> so the places are in a short distance each other

SI131R-00447-P30017 1 SI131R-00447 42.44 60.04 <o,Q3,B1,P3> in my opinion it's important to balance between the university studies and your job because if you don't do this you don't held

SI131R-00447-P40018 1 SI131R-00447 47.52 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P4> and finally you can board the airplane
SI131R-00447-P50019 1 SI131R-00447 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> students should use the technology to practice your their activities in the university to (%hesitation%) understand in a better way the concepts and information that your professors give them
SI131R-00447-P50020 1 SI131R-00447 0.00 10.62 <o,Q3,B2,P5> it's important the face to face learning because you can ask some questions to the professor if you have doubts

SI131R-00447-P50022 1 SI131R-00447 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P5> attending lectures it's important to use because you you can hear specialised professors so you can learn more about the topics
SI131R-00447-P50023 1 SI131R-00447 0.00 12.06 <o,Q3,B2,P5> in my opinion learning facilities it's very important in the university or school because you can practise your knowledge

SI131R-00475-P10005 1 SI131R-00475 5.46 15.18 <o,Q4,B1,P1> yokohama has many sightseeing place so for example chinatown or (mus-) museum
SI131R-00475-P10005 1 SI131R-00475 15.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> chinatown is a good place

SI131R-00475-P10007 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 4.35 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i spend free time with my little brother

SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 8.54 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think all students should not get jobs to pay all their university studies
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 8.54 10.53 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i have two reasons
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 10.53 19.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first (%hesitation%) we should study on focus in universities
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 19.87 47.41 <o,Q4,B1,P3> second all students have to spend a time when they are student because (%hesitation%) because we he must he must experience this student time
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 47.41 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> that is why i think all students should not get jobs to pay all their university studies
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 9.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> okay i will tell you about travelling by airplane
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 9.14 20.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first you arrive at airplane by transportation like a car or a bus or train
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 20.93 37.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then you have to check in and you go to document control to check your bags and luggage
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 37.39 52.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> third step you should wait at hall and you got you can go bathroom and eating eat the lund eat lunch
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 52.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally you can board on the airplanes
SI131R-00475-P50019 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use brain to use only consider
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 14.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think face to face is important things because (%hesitation%) we can communicate with people on face to face
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475 14.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we impress express our feelings
SI131R-00475-P50021 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 17.55 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think group project is good academy because with group project we can we can talk with teammate
SI131R-00475-P50021 1 SI131R-00475 17.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so we (imp-)
SI131R-00475-P50022 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 8.13 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think attending lecture is better than studying alone
SI131R-00475-P50022 1 SI131R-00475 8.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> because if we can attend the lectures we can ask (%hesitation%) questions that we can't we can't
SI131R-00475-P50023 1 SI131R-00475 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it is necessary to provide learning modern facilities because we must catch up with era so we can get knowledge
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 13.48 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i am really interested in learning about other countries because (%hesitation%) for my career i need to learn of other culture how they deal with the bargains and all these things
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512 13.48 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i prefer to take advantage from know about this cultures and make my deals
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 4.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm keen on doing exercise
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 4.26 5.99 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's really important for me
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 5.99 17.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example i'm going to the gym and make some (%hesitation%) exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good with myself
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 17.03 20.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so for me it's incredible
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 4.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i get a buzz from listening music
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 4.29 15.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's incredible because you can put your headphones and improve your skills in english because you can listen (%hesitation%) some words that you never listen in your life
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 15.63 18.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so that is the best way to to learn
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 18.57 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and maybe reading
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 8.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i would prefer learning gymnastic rather than learn about i don't know other topics
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512 8.91 16.85 <o,Q4,B2,P1> because it's very important for me that movements (%hesitation%) feel feel great (w-) with me and with my body
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512 16.85 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to reach my my limits
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 4.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> many students at this moment do part time jobs
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 4.16 9.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however (%hesitation%) this have many advantages
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 9.07 19.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you can (de-) develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants to other people improve your know how about the things that you learn in the school
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 19.75 29.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) on the other hand the disadvantages of this is that there are many students don't have time or (may-) maybe are not very organised to do to do these things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 29.60 32.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and is difficult for many people yes
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 32.62 50.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to make the the both things (%hesitation%) because in the future many companies (w-) will be impressed about your (st-) story that how do you know all this things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 50.50 57.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well you you can say ah well i i'm i was a student and employee
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 57.69 60.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i can do the both
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 10.19 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) well for many years (%hesitation%) the pollution has increased the problematic and and environmental (%hesitation%) things
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 10.19 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so (%hesitation%) in this presentation i i am going to show how the acid rain is is (%hesitation%) is form (%hesitation%) through the pollution
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 19.20 31.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) many cars and (%hesitation%) all the pollution that industry make in all this time (%hesitation%) make (%hesitation%) the acid rain (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) drop in the in the cities
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 31.54 44.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (ha-) in this particles (%hesitation%) mix with the cloud water and maybe (%hesitation%) in the future this could be a very very hard for for many people in in their skin
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 44.55 55.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they could suffer some dramatically situations because the environment is not the best for us (a-) at this moment
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 55.35 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we need to save the environment and clean the things
SI131R-00512-P50020 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 11.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i recommend people take a one point five liters of water every single day to be hydrate and feel comfortable with this with (%hesitation%) with (the-) themselves
SI131R-00512-P50020 1 SI131R-00512 11.98 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that is important because the water is life and the life is very important for everyone you know
SI131R-00512-P50021 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 3.19 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) yeah for me is very essential
SI131R-00512-P50021 1 SI131R-00512 3.19 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i recommend people to take (%hesitation%) maybe maybe thirty minutes (e-) every single days to walk and or make any other activities for better but (%hesitation%) at least thirty minutes every single day to the (f-) (%hesitation%) the (%hesitation%) the blood sugar flood in your body
SI131R-00512-P50022 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 2.35 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah that's right
SI131R-00512-P50022 1 SI131R-00512 2.35 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but (%hesitation%) i think it the best (%hesitation%) way to sleep is (%hesitation%) take a a good sleep and (%hesitation%) to take a cycles of sleep of ninety minutes
SI131R-00512-P50022 1 SI131R-00512 10.52 15.29 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very very important you can sleep six seven or eight hours
SI131R-00512-P50022 1 SI131R-00512 15.29 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that is the minimum six hours but you can do (%hesitation%) the best thing that you works for you
SI131R-00512-P50023 1 SI131R-00512 0.00 6.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well (a-) as as we said (%hesitation%) technology is very important right now
SI131R-00512-P50023 1 SI131R-00512 6.30 12.28 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) people need (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) this new devices to improve their in their health
SI131R-00512-P50023 1 SI131R-00512 12.28 20.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i i i think it's (%hesitation%) the best way to improve the lives of people with the technology you know
SI131R-00536-P10005 1 SI131R-00536 0.00 3.84 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think it's interesting because you know about different things
SI131R-00536-P10005 1 SI131R-00536 3.84 10.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> also you know about how people think or how people do things
SI131R-00536-P10005 1 SI131R-00536 10.39 13.72 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think it is very important
SI131R-00536-P10005 1 SI131R-00536 13.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and also it is very interesting interesting
SI131R-00536-P10006 1 SI131R-00536 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i like to (%hesitation%) do different activities at my free time in my in my free time
SI131R-00536-P10006 1 SI131R-00536 7.41 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example i like to read my preferred books and sometimes help my mother clean our our house and sometime go out with my friends (%hesitation%) shopping or watch (mo-) watching
SI131R-00536-P10007 1 SI131R-00536 0.00 3.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i like to do different things to improve my english

SI131R-00586-P40018 1 SI131R-00586 28.36 33.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so that's the beekeepers' (%hesitation%) aim
SI131R-00586-P40018 1 SI131R-00586 33.06 44.81 <o,Q4,B1,P4> they collect honey and they produced in some way (%hesitation%) to get a honey that can be consumed by by all of us

SI131R-00597-P10006 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 4.09 <o,Q4,C,P1> it depends where i go to the holiday
SI131R-00597-P10006 1 SI131R-00597 4.09 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P1> but if it's a beach i prefer sometimes to stay in the hotel and enjoy all the experiences the hotel give us but when it's to an a city i prefer (%hesitation%) knowing more the city

SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 6.65 <o,Q5,C,P3> i am going to be talking if students should get jobs to pay for the university studies
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 6.65 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think that it's not a must but if we can do it it's ok
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 11.61 32.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> like it's great if we can help out our parents with some money because i know that sometimes it can get really (%hesitation%) stressful for our parents to pay for our our studies coz university it's very expensive everywhere
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 32.12 40.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i also think that we have to to just (%hesitation%) help them out
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 40.52 52.32 <o,Q5,C,P3> but some of the disadvantages are that sometimes we can (%hesitation%) get really stressful with that and we can lower our grades
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 52.32 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion it's better if you don't do it
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 6.51 <o,Q5,C,P4> i am going to be talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 6.51 10.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> and at first you have to get to the airport airport
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 10.45 15.70 <o,Q5,C,P4> you have to go by bus by car by whatever you want
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 15.70 29.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to do a check in because that's a way that you said that you are there on time and they (%hesitation%) register all your your suitcases
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 29.65 32.33 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to go to a document control
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 32.33 40.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> then pass the security because they don't allow a lot of items like weapons and knives
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 40.75 49.37 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to pass to an area where you have to wait till you can board to the airport to the to the airplane
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 49.37 57.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> and finally you board to the airplane and then you are ready to go out to your destination
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 57.32 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and that's all
SI131R-00597-P50019 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that technology has give us a lot of good ways to study and one thing we can use technology is we can we reset record ourselves and then (%hesitation%) listen once and again the recording to memorise everything more easily and fast
SI131R-00597-P50020 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we don't pay the same attention than when we have (%hesitation%) a face to face (%hesitation%) professor coz we don't feel the pressure of giving our hundred hundred percent in the class
SI131R-00597-P50021 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 18.20 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our (%hesitation%) with our friends because sometimes we get very stressful that they don't do anything
SI131R-00597-P50021 1 SI131R-00597 18.20 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and yeah
SI131R-00597-P50022 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 16.42 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think reading alone it's better because we are focused in what in what we are reading and when we do attending lectures i think that we lose a little bit the focus of what we are reading
SI131R-00597-P50022 1 SI131R-00597 16.42 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i think it's better to read by
SI131R-00597-P50023 1 SI131R-00597 0.00 1.02 <o,Q4,C,P5> a lot

SI131R-00597-P50023 1 SI131R-00597 11.38 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> like for example there are a lot of pages online that have games for us to have more entertaining way to learn

SI131R-00614-P40018 1 SI131R-00614 5.30 11.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i will talk about how honey is produced
SI131R-00614-P40018 1 SI131R-00614 11.05 18.94 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you know that the bees collect the nectars from flowers
SI131R-00614-P40018 1 SI131R-00614 18.94 26.15 <o,Q4,B2,P4> next the bees (%hesitation%) make honey from nectar in beehives
SI131R-00614-P40018 1 SI131R-00614 26.15 30.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
SI131R-00614-P40018 1 SI131R-00614 30.72 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the people put in jars the bee the honey sorry and when the honey is ready the jars can be transport and sales at supermarkets or
SI131R-00614-P50019 1 SI131R-00614 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the most important aspect to consider when you want to choose the city or the country when you where you going to study it's that this country has a lot of security for you
SI131R-00614-P50020 1 SI131R-00614 0.00 9.10 <o,Q4,B2,P5> actually all the boss need to have more qualificated employees
SI131R-00614-P50020 1 SI131R-00614 9.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so you need to know aba about other language like chinese or like french to
SI131R-00614-P50021 1 SI131R-00614 0.00 8.72 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that the most difficult situation is that you are far from home
SI131R-00614-P50021 1 SI131R-00614 8.72 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you don't know a lot of people in the new country but you need to do a lot of new friends to don't be alone
SI131R-00614-P50022 1 SI131R-00614 0.00 10.54 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the easier way to know about other culture at your new country is talk with people
SI131R-00614-P50022 1 SI131R-00614 10.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> talk with people and make new friends that teach you the (%hesitation%) the culture of the country

SI131R-00628-P10008 1 SI131R-00628 15.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think that is the best way to improve in a similar (count-)
SI131R-00628-P30017 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 19.88 <o,Q5,B2,P3> as far as i'm concerned the crux of the matter is that one of disadvantage are for example that you during your class you will keep fit and you are a healthy body
SI131R-00628-P30017 1 SI131R-00628 19.88 41.06 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of disadvantage that i think is that if you go to school to study and you in the school (%hesitation%) to do fitness classes you in your house need spend more time to prepare your lesson in your exams
SI131R-00628-P30017 1 SI131R-00628 41.06 54.99 <o,Q5,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI131R-00628-P30017 1 SI131R-00628 54.99 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> because in the school you need learn about different
SI131R-00628-P40018 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 7.45 <o,Q4,B1,P4> in the first moment bees take the nectar into flowers
SI131R-00628-P40018 1 SI131R-00628 7.45 15.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> next bees with this nectar make honey in beehives
SI131R-00628-P40018 1 SI131R-00628 15.04 27.73 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when the bees make honey beekeepers use the bees' honey from beehives to fulfil different bottles
SI131R-00628-P40018 1 SI131R-00628 27.73 49.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and with this bottles inside a car or a truck the bottles are transport to different and diverse supermarkets for example local shops (%hesitation%) big commercial centres or even your house
SI131R-00628-P40018 1 SI131R-00628 49.59 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and when you have the bottle in your supermarket with one or two pounds you can buy this
SI131R-00628-P50019 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i guess that the student (%hesitation%) consider the different language the local foods the price of the same things that in their country and the economic level and (ec-) (%hesitation%) (l-) advantage level in
SI131R-00628-P50020 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 11.77 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i guess that the advantage are that when you are study a issue and you learn about this you only learn one things
SI131R-00628-P50020 1 SI131R-00628 11.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but if you study in a second language you can learn the both things at the same time really
SI131R-00628-P50021 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 5.12 <o,Q4,B1,P5> is difficult because you need get on other people
SI131R-00628-P50021 1 SI131R-00628 5.12 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> you need to make more independence things such as wash your kitchen or (%hesitation%) sweep the floor and is very hard when you live alone
SI131R-00628-P50022 1 SI131R-00628 0.00 5.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i believe that you don't really know the local culture
SI131R-00628-P50022 1 SI131R-00628 5.38 18.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> when you go abroad during the months during the weeks you can see other people you can hear different things and then you learn about this local culture

SI131R-00628-P50023 1 SI131R-00628 9.54 17.02 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because when you live in your country and you are a student (pos-) (%hesitation%) normally you live with your partners

SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 6.48 <o,Q4,C,P3> (pinion-) first and foremost i think that education should be free for everyone in the world
SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 6.48 28.53 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in the model of (%hesitation%) of the english speaking countries (%hesitation%) i (th-) i really think that (%hesitation%) yes i agree with the with a position of getting a job to pay for the university studies (%hesitation%) just because (%hesitation%) you don't have to you don't have to depend on banks and you don't have a loan for years
SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 28.53 31.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) you can grow as a person
SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 31.13 39.74 <o,Q4,C,P3> you can learn how to manage (%hesitation%) your time and then you are able to (%hesitation%) enter the the adult life
SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 39.74 57.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> the disadvantages (%hesitation%) the main disadvantages i see are that (%hesitation%) although (%hesitation%) it has many benefits (%hesitation%) you also will have less time to study less time to to spend with your friends less time for yourself (%hesitation%) ultimately
SI131R-00629-P30017 1 SI131R-00629 57.88 60.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> so that's my thinking
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 9.31 <o,Q4,C,P4> well (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) travelling by airplane is one of the most common common ways to to travel nowadays
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 9.31 15.49 <o,Q4,C,P4> and the the stages you need to follow to travel by plane are the next
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 15.49 21.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) first you have to travel to the airport by car by bus by train
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 21.04 24.88 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then you have to check in with your company
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 24.88 30.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) then pass a document control with the police and a security control
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 30.42 33.66 <o,Q4,C,P4> they check your your bags
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 33.66 40.84 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) after that you have to wait for the boarding hour to to your plane
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 40.84 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> then board and then the the plane (%hesitation%) flies to your destination
SI131R-00629-P50019 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> although technologies are mainly seen as a potential detractor of learning in recent years there have been there have been developed (%hesitation%) some apps have been developed to help students to study more effectively like flaschcards application
SI131R-00629-P50020 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 11.75 <o,Q4,C,P5> i i really agree with that affirmation because teachers have the knowledge and have the knowledge to pass on their own knowledge so that's a very important skill
SI131R-00629-P50020 1 SI131R-00629 11.75 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) when learning distance based learning keeps you from grasping
SI131R-00629-P50021 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 10.99 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think group projects are great (%hesitation%) to learn the basic skill of teamwork which you will need along your professional life most definitely
SI131R-00629-P50021 1 SI131R-00629 10.99 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> although it can also lead to distractions and to to confrontation but i think that's a very positive skill to get
SI131R-00629-P50022 1 SI131R-00629 0.00 17.06 <o,Q4,C,P5> yes definitely (%hesitation%) i think that attending to lectures (%hesitation%) is one of the best ways to grasp the concept that you can potentially not understand when studying by your by yourself on your own
SI131R-00629-P50022 1 SI131R-00629 17.06 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> and (%hesitation%) yes i agree

SI131R-00669-P30017 1 SI131R-00669 12.83 19.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so you are must need to be prepare for this fitness classes
SI131R-00669-P30017 1 SI131R-00669 19.50 39.42 <o,Q4,B2,P3> okay in my opinion the advantage is that you are going to be a healthy person and you are going to be happy because the sports and fitness get involved into you and try (%hesitation%) and try to to better your defence and your emotions

SI131R-00669-P30017 1 SI131R-00669 50.15 54.39 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's a nutritional and a physical complement
SI131R-00669-P30017 1 SI131R-00669 54.39 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think that you are going to lose a lot of time and spend (mo-)
SI131R-00669-P40018 1 SI131R-00669 0.00 10.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> okay so as you can see at the in the presentations bees collects nectar from flower from from flowers

SI137O-00007-P30017 1 SI137O-00007 0.00 6.47 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think the question is about should do the part time jobs while they are studying
SI137O-00007-P30017 1 SI137O-00007 6.47 20.91 <o,Q3,B1,P3> the advantage is you can maybe sharpen your time management your on time management your soft skill and maybe you can get earlier experience about professional environment
SI137O-00007-P30017 1 SI137O-00007 20.91 29.16 <o,Q3,B1,P3> and maybe you can met someone that can open your relation and there is a good thing
SI137O-00007-P30017 1 SI137O-00007 29.16 42.42 <o,Q3,B1,P3> and the disadvantage for me is maybe the focus is divided coz you should do the part time job at the same time (%hesitation%) where you are studying in the university
SI137O-00007-P30017 1 SI137O-00007 42.42 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> and my opinion about that is (%hesitation%) it's about your preference if you can maintain your time management very well i think should the part time the not should do part time job is a good things for you

SI137O-00007-P40018 1 SI137O-00007 21.77 29.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so some acid particle fall as as the dust and other acid particle mix with cloud water

SI137O-00007-P50019 1 SI137O-00007 4.38 7.62 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but my simple advice is reflection
SI137O-00007-P50019 1 SI137O-00007 7.62 11.75 <o,Q4,B1,P5> why you eating a good food
SI137O-00007-P50019 1 SI137O-00007 11.75 14.70 <o,Q4,B1,P5> what's your motivate to do this

SI137O-00007-P50019 1 SI137O-00007 16.79 20.23 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so reflecting every day it's its very
SI137O-00007-P50020 1 SI137O-00007 0.00 4.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah of course drinking water is important
SI137O-00007-P50020 1 SI137O-00007 4.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so do you know that human body made from eighty percent of water so i think if you don't drink water enough maybe your body lack of nutrition
SI137O-00007-P50021 1 SI137O-00007 0.00 1.70 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah i think so
SI137O-00007-P50021 1 SI137O-00007 1.70 11.08 <o,Q4,B1,P5> do exercise is (%hesitation%) essential item because it's makes your body stretch and make your make your body health for the future
SI137O-00007-P50021 1 SI137O-00007 11.08 18.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so you must to do exercise as much as you can even you busy on doing your work
SI137O-00007-P50021 1 SI137O-00007 18.00 19.05 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so do it

SI137O-00016-P40018 1 SI137O-00016 0.00 15.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the pollution begin when the factories work and the wind go out the engine
SI137O-00016-P40018 1 SI137O-00016 15.59 28.31 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the pollution go up for the sky and the wind translate this wind for with the sky with the cloud

SI137O-00016-P50022 1 SI137O-00016 8.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think eight hours or seven hours that's a good time to sleep
SI137O-00016-P50023 1 SI137O-00016 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it's very positive because you can find new jobs using the technology and you can create your applications or different things for contribute with the technology humanity

SI137O-00024-P30017 1 SI137O-00024 9.31 17.31 <o,Q5,B1,P3> the disadvantages are that students will divide their time between work and study

SI137O-00024-P40018 1 SI137O-00024 13.37 19.03 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this acid particle are carried by wind

SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 0.00 5.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well in this subject is a little bit complicated to give an opinion
SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 5.53 12.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but at first the (s-) if the students works to pay their universities is interesting
SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 12.07 19.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's very very interesting because they can say i can work in whatever they want

SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 25.54 35.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages is also maybe the the job it can be a source of stress for the student
SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 35.91 47.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if they (ca-) can work some month or some week for the university they doesn't (beco-) (%hesitation%) have the incomes that they need to pay her university

SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 28.70 34.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then we must pass by (%hesitation%) document control maybe if we need a visa or not

SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 37.77 42.61 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then we pass the security controls with our carry on bags
SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 42.61 44.71 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then we have our the wait

SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 50.20 58.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then we have to board on the airplane and and at the ends we have the departure of our flight
SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 58.10 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's wonderful

SI137O-00035-P50020 1 SI137O-00035 0.00 6.91 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well in my own (po-) (%hesitation%) point of view and in my own experience it's better
SI137O-00035-P50020 1 SI137O-00035 6.91 15.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's better to me because i have a good memory when others talk to me and explain me face by face
SI137O-00035-P50020 1 SI137O-00035 15.23 18.46 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but someone says it is not always like that

SI137O-00035-P50021 1 SI137O-00035 5.60 10.50 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and we develop our (%hesitation%) patient
SI137O-00035-P50021 1 SI137O-00035 10.50 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe patient and empathy is the most important aptitude that we develop with these kind of projects
SI137O-00035-P50022 1 SI137O-00035 0.00 4.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to be honest for me it's useful

SI137O-00035-P50022 1 SI137O-00035 14.06 15.99 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think it help us
SI137O-00035-P50022 1 SI137O-00035 15.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe you can remember something in this kind of activities
SI137O-00035-P50023 1 SI137O-00035 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's very very important that universities or schools or any kind of place give us more facilities to learning because we are in a new era and we must have more access and modern to the information

SI137O-00037-P10005 1 SI137O-00037 7.29 14.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i can play basketball with my friends on weekend or after school and i also can swim with my friends

SI137O-00037-P10006 1 SI137O-00037 3.81 11.18 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we (%hesitation%) we play basketball around six person and we divided into two teams
SI137O-00037-P10006 1 SI137O-00037 11.18 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we often win this game and that's a good experience for me and good relax for weekends
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 10.72 <o,Q4,C,P3> about this question i think students gets job after university can make (%hesitation%) have a lots of advantages
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 10.72 18.49 <o,Q4,C,P3> first it can give them money to support them to study for their (%hesitation%) college fee
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 18.49 30.59 <o,Q4,C,P3> and its can give them an experience that can (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) have a lot of benefits when they're come into real work
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 30.59 40.08 <o,Q4,C,P3> and if they cannot (%hesitation%) balance their work life balance it will have a lot of disadvantage
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 40.08 44.16 <o,Q4,C,P3> maybe their (%hesitation%) grades will (%hesitation%) be affected
SI137O-00037-P30017 1 SI137O-00037 44.16 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion students can do some (%hesitation%) job (%hesitation%) in their university time but they can't do much out of their control
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 9.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> if you want to travel by plane its you first should travel to the airport
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 9.04 13.71 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can travel by car bus or train
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 13.71 18.23 <o,Q4,C,P4> when you come to the airport you need to first check in
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 18.23 23.84 <o,Q4,C,P4> and document control will control your document
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 23.84 26.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> and you will go to the security
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 26.59 32.88 <o,Q4,C,P4> make sure you don't brings knives and others things that can harm people
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 32.88 42.06 <o,Q4,C,P4> and after a long time wait you can have some coffee buy some gifts and go to toilet or eat something
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 42.06 44.91 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you can go abroad
SI137O-00037-P40018 1 SI137O-00037 44.91 51.55 <o,Q4,C,P4> and the plane will maybe takes ten minutes to about two hours

SI137O-00037-P50019 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 9.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we can use technology to search for some difficult questions that teachers may (n-) may not answer
SI137O-00037-P50019 1 SI137O-00037 9.92 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and we can also use technology to (%hesitation%) watch some videos about some important question
SI137O-00037-P50020 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think learning from us us teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from (%hesitation%) teachers' movements and get a better understanding and teacher can get students' feedback very quickly and give them answer
SI137O-00037-P50021 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 4.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think there are many skills such as leader's skills
SI137O-00037-P50021 1 SI137O-00037 4.98 11.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can lead a team and make everybody do things they (%hesitation%) they like to do
SI137O-00037-P50021 1 SI137O-00037 11.90 17.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they also can can have the skill to cooperating with friends
SI137O-00037-P50021 1 SI137O-00037 17.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's a important skill for (fut-)
SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 14.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think attending a lecture is very important because the lecturer the speaker of the lecture are also the specialist of the area and they can give you a clear understanding of this area
SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037 14.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but books you read you can't get the point of the (wri-) writer
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037 0.00 9.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's very important because students can know how to learn from this (%hesitation%) learning facilities
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037 9.74 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and teachers can get feedback very clearly from students from this learning (%hesitation%) facilities
SI137O-00064-P10005 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> a lot because i am always pushing myself to learn more and (%hesitation%) know how other cultures and countries lives
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 16.38 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i used to go to the gym or (%hesitation%) church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking around the beach for instance
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064 16.38 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> yeah
SI137O-00064-P10007 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> practicing
SI137O-00064-P10008 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) maybe playing piano
SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 4.20 <o,Q5,C,P3> well it depends
SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 4.20 20.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> have some advantages because students will have the responsibility to handle (%hesitation%) a course in the meantime at the same time they have to study and deliver as well in the best way possible
SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 20.72 30.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it's a advantage if you consider that they will be more responsible (%hesitation%) with their own things
SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 30.02 56.29 <o,Q5,C,P3> obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe in the work because sometimes it's not possible deliver in the best way (%hesitation%) in both sides
SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 56.29 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think in my opinion it's always good
SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 13.94 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so from my understanding this image is dealing with acid rain because they have a lot of consequences in our environment because they can damage a lot the the environment
SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 13.94 26.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we have some particles that fall as dust and can as well rain or snow and damage (%hesitation%) the environment
SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 26.77 28.48 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is the pollution
SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 28.48 40.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> acid particles are in smoke and with the wind or other mix cloud (wat-) water they can damage a lot (%hesitation%) the environment
SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 40.67 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is my understanding for (%hesitation%) about this image
SI137O-00064-P50019 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 11.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's a very important topic because eating (%hesitation%) has the majority in our way to have a healthy living
SI137O-00064-P50019 1 SI137O-00064 11.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i guess we have to we need to have some good habits (%hesitation%) like drink water (%hesitation%) like (%hesitation%)
SI137O-00064-P50020 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 8.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's very important because water is the best drink that you can (%hesitation%) use for a daily basis
SI137O-00064-P50020 1 SI137O-00064 8.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's very important drink always water in the morning afternoon evening because it will clean our body
SI137O-00064-P50021 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 11.49 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes personally normally i go to gym four times in a week and it's very important because (%hesitation%) it's part of (%hesitation%) healthy living
SI137O-00064-P50021 1 SI137O-00064 11.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so in my case and i guess for all the others it's very important making doing exercise because you will
SI137O-00064-P50022 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 9.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i totally agree because (%hesitation%) sleeping it will have (%hesitation%) some consequences in our daily basis
SI137O-00064-P50022 1 SI137O-00064 9.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so (%hesitation%) the best way to have a good deliver in our job in our family is to have (%hesitation%) eight hours at least
SI137O-00064-P50023 1 SI137O-00064 0.00 2.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it depends
SI137O-00064-P50023 1 SI137O-00064 2.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i guess we have a lot of advantages to take from technology but needs to be (%hesitation%) we need to be careful because (%hesitation%) if we spend a lot of time with technology maybe it will have some bad consequences in our daily
SI137O-00068-P10005 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 9.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> now i am living in apartment in the south of bogota with my wife
SI137O-00068-P10005 1 SI137O-00068 9.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and sometimes other persons or people from my family comes to visit me
SI137O-00068-P10006 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 15.84 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really enjoys watching movies and eats popcorn and doing exercise and visit my family
SI137O-00068-P10006 1 SI137O-00068 15.84 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is is all
SI137O-00068-P10007 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 4.51 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really enjoy spending time with my (s-) wife
SI137O-00068-P10007 1 SI137O-00068 4.51 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is the very very very very important person in my life the most important person in my life because there we we share all time
SI137O-00068-P10008 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 9.38 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think that (%hesitation%) in the future i had two differents (%hesitation%) kinds of things
SI137O-00068-P10008 1 SI137O-00068 9.38 11.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i want to travel
SI137O-00068-P10008 1 SI137O-00068 11.05 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i want to know to meet the the world and other countries

SI137O-00068-P30017 1 SI137O-00068 32.52 39.41 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) and but disadvantage is that (%hesitation%) the time is very very very short

SI137O-00068-P30017 1 SI137O-00068 50.14 58.89 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion is not the best but (%hesitation%) sometimes is necessary (%hesitation%) that student do it
SI137O-00068-P30017 1 SI137O-00068 58.89 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> is all
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 11.11 <o,Q5,A2,P4> ok there are six steps to take (%hesitation%) a travel in in airplane by airplane
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 11.11 13.29 <o,Q5,A2,P4> it's very easy
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 13.29 17.45 <o,Q5,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) the first is (%hesitation%) travel to airport
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 17.45 26.93 <o,Q5,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) the second step is is (%hesitation%) to do check in (%hesitation%) pass through document control and security
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 26.93 34.84 <o,Q5,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) after people needs wait (%hesitation%) need wait to to board
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 34.84 38.86 <o,Q5,A2,P4> after they are need board
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 38.86 52.68 <o,Q5,A2,P4> it is very important (%hesitation%) when the people travelling by airplane it's worse it's better don't bring a own car
SI137O-00068-P40018 1 SI137O-00068 52.68 60.00 <o,Q5,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) maybe travel in travel to airport to airport in a bus
SI137O-00068-P50019 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 6.36 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agreed the technology is is is a great tool
SI137O-00068-P50019 1 SI137O-00068 6.36 12.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and (%hesitation%) it's the study is more easy
SI137O-00068-P50019 1 SI137O-00068 12.11 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it is very very easier to learn to teach because it's now the
SI137O-00068-P50020 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 1.56 <o,Q4,B1,P5> that depends
SI137O-00068-P50020 1 SI137O-00068 1.56 11.05 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) for people it's more (eas-) it's easier to learn when the teacher is near

SI137O-00068-P50021 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that the most important skill that the student get is the empathy it's their responsibility is their respect it's the work co working and other things that i thinks is very very very important

SI137O-00068-P50023 1 SI137O-00068 0.00 17.34 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to me for me it's very very important that the universities give to the students learning facilities and others tools that the learning and teachings will be very very very easier
SI137O-00068-P50023 1 SI137O-00068 17.34 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and (th-) it's
SI137O-00072-P10005 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very interested in learning other (countr-) countries especially the cultural things
SI137O-00072-P10006 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like i would like to watch some videos movies tv series (%hesitation%) things like that
SI137O-00072-P10007 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would like i would like to have some conversations with artificial intelligence (%hesitation%) to practise my speaking english (%hesitation%) and and listening skills
SI137O-00072-P10008 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 7.65 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really wanted to learn the skills of (%hesitation%) coding especially with artificial intelligence
SI137O-00072-P10008 1 SI137O-00072 7.65 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i want to build applications with this technology
SI137O-00072-P30017 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 7.39 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well i think one of the advantages must be that they can earn money through those part time jobs
SI137O-00072-P30017 1 SI137O-00072 7.39 16.96 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but at the same time those jobs may (%hesitation%) distract them from their studies so they may have poor academic performance
SI137O-00072-P30017 1 SI137O-00072 16.96 32.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> my opinion is i think those students who have good self control skills can try the part time jobs and (%hesitation%) because for them they can manage their own time
SI137O-00072-P30017 1 SI137O-00072 32.66 40.32 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the (%hesitation%) there're more advantages than disadvantages (%hesitation%) to those (pe-) to those students

SI137O-00072-P40018 1 SI137O-00072 2.64 10.07 <o,Q5,B2,P4> ok so the pollution is from factories and vehicles
SI137O-00072-P40018 1 SI137O-00072 10.07 18.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and they can they can drain (%hesitation%) acid particles that are in smoke
SI137O-00072-P40018 1 SI137O-00072 18.02 21.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then the acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00072-P40018 1 SI137O-00072 21.59 29.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some of them (%hesitation%) may fall as dust which can damage to which can be (dama-) damage to environment
SI137O-00072-P40018 1 SI137O-00072 29.91 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles can mix with cloud water (%hesitation%) which can (%hesitation%) can you know become rain and snow (%hesitation%) which can also become (%hesitation%) you know harmful to our environment
SI137O-00072-P50019 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 6.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> eat more fruits vegetables and plants and beans
SI137O-00072-P50019 1 SI137O-00072 6.88 10.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> definitely not fat foods

SI137O-00072-P50020 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 3.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> water is really important to our human body

SI137O-00072-P50020 1 SI137O-00072 16.39 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> anyway
SI137O-00072-P50021 1 SI137O-00072 0.00 13.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> opinion well in my opinion i think (%hesitation%) it depends on different people like (%hesitation%) maybe it's (%hesitation%) over over (%hesitation%) you know
SI137O-00072-P50021 1 SI137O-00072 13.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it it's not a good frequency for people to do every day

SI137O-00072-P50022 1 SI137O-00072 11.06 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it just depends on different different (%hesitation%) situation in different people

SI137O-00076-P30017 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 7.85 <o,Q4,B2,P3> yes i think that university courses should include a period of back to work experience
SI137O-00076-P30017 1 SI137O-00076 7.85 19.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's important to guarantee that students will go to the working time knowing what is waiting for them
SI137O-00076-P30017 1 SI137O-00076 19.02 23.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> students can be prepared to be more efficient
SI137O-00076-P30017 1 SI137O-00076 23.31 42.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some disadvantages of this one is that we need to have investments in laboratories and other stuffs to guarantee that works experience it will be valid it will be enough to (%hesitation%) support the learning of these students in the real conditions
SI137O-00076-P30017 1 SI137O-00076 42.60 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the quantity of adjv advantages of course is very bigger compared with the disadvantage of this kind of stuffs
SI137O-00076-P40018 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 1.78 <o,Q4,B1,P4> hello
SI137O-00076-P40018 1 SI137O-00076 1.78 8.54 <o,Q4,B1,P4> i will do a presentation about people visiting three new onlines pop site music sites
SI137O-00076-P40018 1 SI137O-00076 8.54 24.59 <o,Q4,B1,P4> on the graph below we can see in the blue line the website music now in orange line the site songs four you and in reds line the site tunes net
SI137O-00076-P40018 1 SI137O-00076 24.59 39.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> we can see along seven days one week as we can see on the x bar and we can see a big improvement on the tunes net on the last days of our checking
SI137O-00076-P40018 1 SI137O-00076 39.93 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and we can see a reduction in the other two (%hesitation%) sites music now and songs four you maybe due to the changes of the material showed presented on these websites
SI137O-00076-P50019 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> from my point of view a good team leader is a person that hear all members of the team and make a good propose proposal to solve all the problems and get benefits to everybody inside the same team
SI137O-00076-P50020 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in terms of hierarchy could be difficult to justify a leader in small teams because they usually understanding that small teams are manageable by theirself and it is the main problem in you get small teams
SI137O-00076-P50021 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 4.01 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that disagree is a strong word
SI137O-00076-P50021 1 SI137O-00076 4.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the team members should be encouraged to sure to share his point of view no matter if it's aligned or not aligned with the remain members of the team
SI137O-00076-P50022 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 2.32 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't think so
SI137O-00076-P50022 1 SI137O-00076 2.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that the most quantity of activities can be done out of face to face and of course some specific points must be done face to face but it's not the majority of the activities
SI137O-00076-P50023 1 SI137O-00076 0.00 3.44 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it's a sensible point of view
SI137O-00076-P50023 1 SI137O-00076 3.44 11.79 <o,Q5,B1,P5> if you are (lo-) looking for a short time maybe sometimes a guy that's working alone will have better results
SI137O-00076-P50023 1 SI137O-00076 11.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but looking for a medium or a huge time as this guy is teaching other ple other (pe-) person

SI137O-00100-P10005 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 4.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really keen on new cultures

SI137O-00100-P10005 1 SI137O-00100 12.45 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's the reason why i would love to learn about foreign cultures such as indian culture
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 5.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> during my free time i love visiting museums
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100 5.20 13.56 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100 13.56 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 8.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100 8.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (f-) platforms such as this one can help students to improve the way the way that they speak write or his or her reading skills
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 15.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i had the possibility to learn a new (sk-) skill definitely it will be to learn a new language maybe a language that it seems difficult such as chinese or japanese
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100 15.58 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> this kind of language will help us in the future
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> university students that do part time jobs are better in organising their schedules or their studying time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 11.61 29.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> but on the other hand it is difficult to them to focus on their exam so it would be kind of (%hesitation%) stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 29.57 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i will say that the optimal situation would be maybe to work in a part time job that is related with our or your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law it will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can helps you to understand better your knowledged about law
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 8.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> climate change is one of the biggest challenge that human being are facing nowadays
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 8.67 19.35 <o,Q5,C,P4> mainly it is caused because of pollution pollution that factories emit or produce when they are working or functioning
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 19.35 27.54 <o,Q5,C,P4> this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind or in the clouds
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 27.54 47.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is important to be aware that this kind of acid particles arrive into our lakes or rivers damaging its species that live there such as octopus or maybe kind different kind of fishes
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 47.13 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> but on the other hand due to the acid rains itch which is in the clouds it can reach into forests damaging our trees
SI137O-00100-P50019 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> my best piece of of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of food (s-) food such as vegetables cereals fresh meat
SI137O-00100-P50020 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 15.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> drinking water is an habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face the complete routine as a day
SI137O-00100-P50020 1 SI137O-00100 15.93 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it helps your organism to work better
SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 9.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> i will said that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person
SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100 9.26 13.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you love doing exercise why not doing every day

SI137O-00100-P50022 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 7.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> the healthiest option is to exactly sleep eight hours per day
SI137O-00100-P50022 1 SI137O-00100 7.47 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but there are some studies that shows that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well
SI137O-00100-P50023 1 SI137O-00100 0.00 3.36 <o,Q5,C,P5> positive effect of course
SI137O-00100-P50023 1 SI137O-00100 3.36 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that thanks to technology we are allowed to do several activities such as for example work work from home or taking some pictures about our daily life

SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102 0.00 6.12 <o,Q5,B1,P3> all students should get job to pay for their university studies

SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 7.44 14.21 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you want travelling by airplane you need to travel to the airport

SI137O-00114-P40018 1 SI137O-00114 33.67 42.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some acid particles fall as dust and pollution the rivers and the sea
SI137O-00114-P40018 1 SI137O-00114 42.87 53.41 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so so the the solution for that is the electrical vehicles
SI137O-00114-P40018 1 SI137O-00114 53.41 55.31 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so that's it

SI137O-00120-P30017 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 8.46 <o,Q4,B2,P3> schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes

SI137O-00120-P30017 1 SI137O-00120 24.27 50.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as disadvantages we can say about the weather and the need to adapt some fitness classes (%hesitation%) to so so all the students can can take this class and enjoy the sun
SI137O-00120-P30017 1 SI137O-00120 50.64 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i agree it should be one (priori-) priority of the schools and colleges
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 6.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so today i will talk about how honey is produced
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 6.79 11.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 11.43 24.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then they go to the honey hive the beehives where the bees make honey from this nectar that was collected
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 24.10 36.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put them into pots that are ready to be sell
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 36.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these pots goes to the transportation that takes it to the supermarket when people can buy it
SI137O-00120-P50019 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture the student will be and how much he will learn
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the (ad-) advantages of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in the culture and lifestyle
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120 11.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people
SI137O-00120-P50021 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> learn the language and understand the accents and also live far from home can be another difficulty that students can face during this time
SI137O-00120-P50022 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can make (f-) friend they can be friends with locals and go to different places in the city not that only tourist goes but different (pla-)
SI137O-00120-P50023 1 SI137O-00120 0.00 16.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree because everything depends on them (%hesitation%) what they eat how they eat when they are going to eat what they are going to do to deal with finances
SI137O-00120-P50023 1 SI137O-00120 16.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and everything is are the (st-)
SI137O-00124-P10005 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very much interest in learning about other countries especially about their culture and the language and everything
SI137O-00124-P10006 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to listen to music and i enjoy to play guitar and to learn other musical instruments
SI137O-00124-P10007 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
SI137O-00124-P10008 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 4.49 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i would like to learn to play sitar
SI137O-00124-P10008 1 SI137O-00124 4.49 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's a indian instrument
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 9.55 <o,Q4,B1,P3> all students (%hesitation%) should have part time jobs while they were studying
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 9.55 24.38 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) well (%hesitation%) with it you have some advantages for example they will not worry about how they will pay for the university which is a good thing
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 24.38 37.76 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in the other side (%hesitation%) there are some disadvantages for it because they would not (%hesitation%) they would not be able to concentrate they in they studies
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 37.76 45.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> they would not (%hesitation%) have enough time to (%hesitation%) learning the disciplines
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 45.20 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so in my opinion (%hesitation%) they students should shouldn't have to work to pay for the graduation in a college
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well (%hesitation%) we can see in this picture how the acid rain is produced
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 10.61 20.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> in the right side of the chart you can see the sources of pollution like factories and vehicles that produce pollution
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 20.02 27.77 <o,Q4,B1,P4> these (%hesitation%) acid (%hesitation%) particles (%hesitation%) are in the smoke that go up in the sky
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 27.77 33.25 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 33.25 42.17 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) some of the (%hesitation%) acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 42.17 51.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then finally these acid acid particles (%hesitation%) follow (%hesitation%) with the rain or the snow
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 51.06 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so (%hesitation%) we can see in this diagram how the (a-) acid rain is produced and returned to through the soil
SI137O-00124-P50019 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 4.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well the best advice is to choose the right foods
SI137O-00124-P50019 1 SI137O-00124 4.13 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example you can (%hesitation%) eat more vegetables more fruits and specially to avoid processed foods especially the ultra processed foods that we can (%hesitation%) find in the biscuits and the other products in the (su-)
SI137O-00124-P50020 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 5.29 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) drinking water is very important to our health
SI137O-00124-P50020 1 SI137O-00124 5.29 12.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's (%hesitation%) ideally you should drink at least two liters of water per day
SI137O-00124-P50020 1 SI137O-00124 12.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it will make your organism to function better to get more to become more (heal-)
SI137O-00124-P50021 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 12.21 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes it's fundamental to do exercise every day specially cardio exercises also strength exercises stretch exercises
SI137O-00124-P50021 1 SI137O-00124 12.21 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important to exercise in different ways to improve your health
SI137O-00124-P50022 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i agree that most of people (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) need about eight hours per day
SI137O-00124-P50022 1 SI137O-00124 8.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> some people made seven hours some people a little more but (%hesitation%) in average (%hesitation%) a lot of people need eight hours of sleep per day
SI137O-00124-P50023 1 SI137O-00124 0.00 9.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think nowadays technology has a (%hesitation%) terrible effect in the health of people specially in the spine
SI137O-00124-P50023 1 SI137O-00124 9.90 16.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> people (%hesitation%) take so much time in the mobiles phone with a bad position of the neck
SI137O-00124-P50023 1 SI137O-00124 16.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so in general technology is bad for the health
SI137O-00129-P10005 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very interested in learning about other countries
SI137O-00129-P10006 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 10.96 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in my free time i enjoy studying english trying to learn something new and trying to speak
SI137O-00129-P10006 1 SI137O-00129 10.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i want to improve my english
SI137O-00129-P10007 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think practising a lot is the best way to me to improve my english
SI137O-00129-P10008 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i could learn a new skill it would be (%hesitation%) speaking english english better or speaking other languages like (%hesitation%) french and german
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 8.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 8.58 17.39 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think (%hesitation%) there are some (%hesitation%) advantages for them to earn some money while (%hesitation%) they are at university
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 17.39 38.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) as (%hesitation%) the disadvantages i can say that (%hesitation%) while (%hesitation%) while working or while doing part time jobs they cannot find (%hesitation%) perhaps (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) enough time to study their own lessons
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 38.13 44.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) they maybe fail in their (%hesitation%) studies or in their exam
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 44.27 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinions (%hesitation%) each student can arrange (%hesitation%) their own situation
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 9.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as you know vehicles and factories produce smoke and this smoke pollutes the air
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 9.33 14.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) in this polluted air there are acid particles
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 14.18 18.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and these particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 18.35 25.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 25.80 38.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and (%hesitation%) after some time (%hesitation%) these acid particles are (%hesitation%) in form of air or snow (%hesitation%) fall down to the earth surface
SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 38.10 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they damage to environment
SI137O-00129-P50020 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think drinking lots of water is very important (%hesitation%) for healthy body because (%hesitation%) drinking water helps (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) the body to out to waste (%hesitation%) from the body and (%hesitation%) it keeps the body fit and in form
SI137O-00129-P50022 1 SI137O-00129 0.00 14.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i don't agree with that because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) this may be true for children because children need (%hesitation%) more than eight or ten hours

SI137O-00231-P10006 1 SI137O-00231 3.58 13.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> dancing boost my muscular strength and flexibility and as well as improving my cooperation and balance

SI137O-00231-P10007 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would like to spend most of my time with my mother because we are both avid readers and we love to share our different opinions about a book or a piece of knowledge inside it
SI137O-00231-P10007 1 SI137O-00231 14.77 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> and she always encourage me to voice my opinion

SI137O-00231-P10008 1 SI137O-00231 10.46 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> i know it's a demanding job and requires effort but i'll seize any opportunities to improve my ability
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 10.79 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they studying at universities
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 10.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> so this kind of phenomenon do have some advantages
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 15.25 31.40 <o,Q4,C,P3> students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they got a salary for their works which is which helps their parents save a lot of money and this and should be encouraged
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 31.40 46.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> but yet it has some disadvantages like part time job may distract students from their normal studying process and do some harm to their academic scores
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 46.58 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> so my opinion is that we should balance our work and study in order to develop ourselves while having access to the society
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 5.60 <o,Q4,C,P4> now i'm going to introduce the steps of travelling by airplane
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 5.60 11.76 <o,Q4,C,P4> first you should take some transportations to airport
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 11.76 17.86 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can rather take a bus or drive by car or take a underground
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 17.86 30.10 <o,Q4,C,P4> after you arrive at the airport next what you should do is to check in that is to say to put a luggage on the plane ahead of your (%hesitation%) ahead of time
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 30.10 33.29 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you went a document control
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 33.29 40.17 <o,Q4,C,P4> some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 40.17 46.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> finally you have after you has (pa-) after you have passed the check you can enter the waiting room
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 46.94 56.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> during the waiting time you can rather you can choose to go shopping or having a coffee or eat something if you feeling peckish
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 56.08 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> finally you can go on board and have a good time
SI137O-00231-P50019 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 4.97 <o,Q4,C,P5> so first technology can offer us a lot of new information
SI137O-00231-P50019 1 SI137O-00231 4.97 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example i can catch a glimpse of the latest news happen in the world by checking my cell phones and next use some websites like z libraries and some vocabulary (si-) websites to help you learning
SI137O-00231-P50020 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 10.03 <o,Q4,C,P5> well learning face to face sometimes boost efficiency and make me more concentrated on learning itself
SI137O-00231-P50020 1 SI137O-00231 10.03 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but sometimes is not as convenient as technology (%hesitation%) (wha-) (%hesitation%) where use technology i can just stay at home and save a lot of (ti-)
SI137O-00231-P50021 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 2.56 <o,Q4,C,P5> there are many advantages
SI137O-00231-P50021 1 SI137O-00231 2.56 11.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example first students can learn from others good virtues and get rid of their disadvantages
SI137O-00231-P50021 1 SI137O-00231 11.95 20.28 <o,Q4,C,P5> and second students can learn a spirit of cooperation which is very important in the society
SI137O-00231-P50022 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 15.85 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think attending lectures is sometimes more effective because when you are listening to others' opinions you are seeing subjectively and efficiently to judge whether what he said is true or false
SI137O-00231-P50022 1 SI137O-00231 15.85 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> but when you are reading books you may sometimes just distract
SI137O-00231-P50023 1 SI137O-00231 0.00 20.80 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think modern learning facilities is not that helpful really because these kind of modern mobile phones laptops while sometimes distract ourselves from the learning process itself sometimes studying (as-) (atti-) attitude and methods are more important

SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 14.09 32.54 <o,Q3,B1,P3> the advantages is can be give they responsible to ourselves to theyselves

SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 39.17 46.82 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think it is can be tried but with proportion that is not too much
SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 46.82 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> then we can study at

SI137O-00244-P10007 1 SI137O-00244 4.80 13.47 <o,Q5,C,P1> and (%hesitation%) i also take english courses because teachers can (%hesitation%) correct my errors

SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 4.28 <o,Q5,C,P1> i want to learn how to play the guitar

SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 6.56 11.65 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it's cool to play the guitar while you are singing
SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 11.65 15.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> and and it can heat up the atmosphere too
SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 15.64 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i want to learn this new skill
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 8.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) there are advantages if (%hesitation%) university students do part time job
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 8.62 18.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) for example students can gain skills and working experience and they can earn some pocket money
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 18.50 27.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> if they want to buy (%hesitation%) things like cell phone they can pay it themselves
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 27.78 33.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> and through the working experience they can be independent
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 33.21 37.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand they may have no time for their studies
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 37.52 44.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) it can take longer for their studies too because they do the part time jobs
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 44.92 50.64 <o,Q5,C,P3> personally i don't think all university students should do part time jobs
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 50.64 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) it's up they should have the choice if they want to do it or not because (%hesitation%) some subjects are very (d-)
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 6.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) good good afternoon everyone
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 6.56 11.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it's my pleasure to give a presentation on acid rain
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 11.46 13.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> please look at this diagram
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 13.95 18.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first we see pollution is from factory and vehicles
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 18.80 22.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then (aci-) acid particles are in smoke
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 22.66 27.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> next acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 27.16 30.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> there are two possibilities here
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 30.04 34.17 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first some acid particles fall us dust
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 34.17 37.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 37.59 42.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that acid particles are in rain or snow
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 42.05 46.36 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that's how acid rain is formed
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 46.36 50.69 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain can damage environment
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 50.69 54.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) that brings to the end of my presentation
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 54.43 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> thank you for your listening
SI137O-00244-P50019 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would suggest that (%hesitation%) they should have three regular meal every day and they should (%hesitation%) eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamin
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 4.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to drink a lot of water
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244 4.29 10.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if you don't drink enough (%hesitation%) it's easier to get (%hesitation%) dehydrated
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244 10.52 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if the body doesn't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 4.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> basically it's essential to do exercise every day
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244 4.94 12.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we don't need to do very much (%hesitation%) even twenty minutes that would be ok
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244 12.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 3.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it depends on people
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 3.73 6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need eight hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 6.12 9.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need only five hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 9.01 13.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the most important thing is you sleep enough
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 13.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244 0.00 15.03 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think (%hesitation%) technology has a negative impact on people's health because we always overuse the (%hesitation%) computer or smartphone
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244 15.03 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it can harm our eyes our our sight
SI137O-00251-P10005 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 9.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm very interested about learning other countries because it can get me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures
SI137O-00251-P10005 1 SI137O-00251 9.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also i can meet another peoples that i can communicate with to improve my foreign language skills
SI137O-00251-P10006 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 5.07 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending my free time with my friends in the school stadium
SI137O-00251-P10006 1 SI137O-00251 5.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we can play all kinds of (sk-) all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and (%hesitation%) basketball which will make us a healthier body and (%hesitation%) funny a fun time
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 8.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve the english is to read aloud and watch some english movies
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251 8.06 12.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> read aloud will lead me to have a good pronunciations
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251 12.69 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and watching some english movies will give me some (%hesitation%) writing (instr-)
SI137O-00251-P10008 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 9.18 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm (%hesitation%) learning a new skills about playing piano which is (%hesitation%) popular and (%hesitation%) enjoyable skills around the world
SI137O-00251-P10008 1 SI137O-00251 9.18 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> learning piano can give me a opportunity to (%hesitation%) expand my music my music visions and improve my music taste
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 9.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it is very common that all university students should do part time jobs while they're studying and there are many advantages
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 9.46 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example they can making friends when they are working with with each others
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 15.72 23.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they can also learn many practical skills (%hesitation%) which might be used in the near future
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 23.49 36.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between (%hesitation%) their part time jobs and their studies
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 36.43 43.19 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion i think all university students should do the part time jobs
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 43.19 56.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they will find they (wi-) they can do this to improve their improve their self (ab-) abilities about working with each others
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 56.61 60.16 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they can also learning how to (thin-)
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 1.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 1.60 5.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i am giving a presentation about acid rain
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 5.27 11.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> firstly there are many cars and factories generate some pollutions like smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 11.77 15.84 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the acid (parti-) particles are in the smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 15.84 23.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as the as the smoke carried by the wind the acid particles will divided to into two parts
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 23.14 30.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid particles will fall as dust and (%hesitation%) damage to the lake
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 30.20 38.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and other acid particles will mix with cloud waters and then they will contain in the rain or snows
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 38.80 42.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that would do a great damage to the environment
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 42.43 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i think acid rain is very is very bad for our health and very bad for our earth so we need to decrease the number of the acid rain and (%hesitation%) and (%hesitation%) develop our technology (a-)
SI137O-00251-P50019 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 13.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i suggest (%hesitation%) they can eat more vegetables and fruits because they contain more nutrients than the meat and junk food
SI137O-00251-P50019 1 SI137O-00251 13.48 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and this will lead to a stronger health and (%hesitation%) stronger bodies
SI137O-00251-P50020 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 8.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> is is common that water are essential part in our bodies
SI137O-00251-P50020 1 SI137O-00251 8.43 18.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think drinking water can keeping us alive and give us a clear mind and in the daytime
SI137O-00251-P50020 1 SI137O-00251 18.07 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it can also do a great help
SI137O-00251-P50021 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 11.20 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it is quite essential to do exercise every day because this can improve our health and give us a stronger bodies
SI137O-00251-P50021 1 SI137O-00251 11.20 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> to connect with each others you can doing exercise with other peoples who can share the same interest in sport
SI137O-00251-P50022 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 10.76 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) an eight hour sleep in night at night can give us a clear a clearly mind in the daytime
SI137O-00251-P50022 1 SI137O-00251 10.76 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they can also give us many energies to make us keep (%hesitation%) keep wise
SI137O-00251-P50023 1 SI137O-00251 0.00 11.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think technology have a positive impact on people's health because it can give us some treatments (%hesitation%) correctly
SI137O-00251-P50023 1 SI137O-00251 11.48 16.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they can also give some ways to improve our health scientifically
SI137O-00251-P50023 1 SI137O-00251 16.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and they can also we can
SI137O-00281-P10005 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 5.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to communicate and to know new places
SI137O-00281-P10005 1 SI137O-00281 5.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's why i'm interested in in know other culture and other language
SI137O-00281-P10006 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i (goin-) i like (%hesitation%) some sport and to walk and talk to my friends and play and to play with my childrens
SI137O-00281-P10007 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 7.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is have a whole immersion in english
SI137O-00281-P10007 1 SI137O-00281 7.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i want i want to say (%hesitation%) speak every time in english listen the radio or the tv in english and write in english too
SI137O-00281-P10008 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 15.04 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like fly like a bird because if you are in the sky flying you can see everything (%hesitation%) with another point of view that was fantastic
SI137O-00281-P10008 1 SI137O-00281 15.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and maybe you can arrive (%hesitation%) early
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 10.15 <o,Q4,B1,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 10.15 30.32 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because (%hesitation%) like that they can have more money more cash (%hesitation%) and they depend less (%hesitation%) from their parents
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 30.32 50.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> as (%hesitation%) a disadvantage of of work during the university is that they will have less time to to less free time to enjoy the life
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 50.77 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's good to have a part time job but not all the time
SI137O-00281-P40018 1 SI137O-00281 0.00 21.94 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when the vehicles and the factories (%hesitation%) is are working (%hesitation%) there there's (%hesitation%) a lot of pollution in and emit smoke with particles with contaminant particles that are carried and mixed in the wind
SI137O-00281-P40018 1 SI137O-00281 21.94 33.94 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and some of their of them (%hesitation%) come back to the to the earth (%hesitation%) fall down as as contamination
SI137O-00281-P40018 1 SI137O-00281 33.94 36.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the other is mixed with the clouds

SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 9.91 15.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first we must go to airport
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 15.59 23.81 <o,Q4,B2,P4> to go to the airport we can go by bus train or car
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 23.81 31.67 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the airport the first thing that we have to do is the check in

SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 37.34 40.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then we have to stay waiting
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 40.59 47.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the waiting area we have restaurants toilet shops and cafes
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 47.73 50.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we can eat something
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 50.45 54.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that they will call us to board
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 54.55 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so then we will go to flight
SI137O-00286-P50019 1 SI137O-00286 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the students can't use technology (%hesitation%) like (in-) internet (%hesitation%) smartphones to send messages or call (%hesitation%) to the
SI137O-00286-P50020 1 SI137O-00286 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i prefer face to face to technology (%hesitation%) learnings because face to face (%hesitation%) the relations are better

SI137O-00286-P50022 1 SI137O-00286 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i think that attending lectures is more interesting because the speakers gives us their knowledges
SI137O-00286-P50023 1 SI137O-00286 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to have modern learning facilities is interesting for the university because (%hesitation%) like this the university (%hesitation%) will go a good (%hesitation%) level university

SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 5.52 11.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first you need travel to airport by the public transportation or your private car

SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 20.54 25.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that you need do the document control by the staff
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 25.98 32.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they will check all the details and identify the (di-) (i-) identify
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 32.09 35.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) following is security check
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 35.24 41.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they might check your personal (d-) (b-) belongings and your pocket and so on
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 41.00 51.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) done with all those things you might need wait in your correct gate and sit or go to the toilet or shopping
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 51.77 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) finally you might (%hesitation%) go on board and fly take off
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319 0.00 6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for the university student they might use google scholar to do their literature review
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319 6.53 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> besides that they mind use zooms or teams to consult some questions with their professors and also make (%hesitation%) effective conversation with their classmate
SI137O-00319-P50020 1 SI137O-00319 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is apparently for the normal students face to face of course guide them to be discipline and also to be (%hesitation%) effective but for the student who are genius study alone is a much better way for them
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319 0.00 8.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319 8.24 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many (%hesitation%) different views in the teams
SI137O-00319-P50022 1 SI137O-00319 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for the majority of students attending lectures or guide by professors are much productivity since those students lack (%hesitation%) self discipline we might feel lazy or exhausted and we can ask professor questions in time
SI137O-00319-P50023 1 SI137O-00319 0.00 15.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i have to say it is hundred percent (%hesitation%) significant for for university to do so because right now (%hesitation%) the artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among the students
SI137O-00319-P50023 1 SI137O-00319 15.25 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00324-P10005 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 8.64 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interesting because i want to travel to another countries and meet their culture and traditions
SI137O-00324-P10005 1 SI137O-00324 8.64 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i want (%hesitation%) to speak with them in this idiom (%hesitation%) because it's the most popular language in the world
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to go with my friends and family (%hesitation%) to concerts museums and maybe go to swim or (%hesitation%) a coffee shop just to talk and having some fun
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324 15.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but most of the time i'm just in my house
SI137O-00324-P10007 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 8.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to watch movies (%hesitation%) reading books and listen to music in english
SI137O-00324-P10007 1 SI137O-00324 8.35 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i used to visit pages like this like write and improve and speak and improve to (%hesitation%) improve my english better
SI137O-00324-P10008 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i could choose learn better and faster (%hesitation%) without any problems and (%hesitation%) to keep any information in my head in my hand and (%hesitation%) i could share it with others
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 16.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages (%hesitation%) are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can (%hesitation%) win or gain more money while they are studying
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 16.30 38.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantages are that they didn't have a lot of time to work and studying and they cannot balance their job and (w-) study and so they need need free time to do a lot of things
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 38.34 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion they need to work and organisate their times to work and job to work and study at the same time without any problems and (%hesitation%) they can learn and improve their job and study time
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 4.09 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this is an image to environment
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324 4.09 14.74 <o,Q5,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) as we can see the factories and vehicles create pollution (%hesitation%) that became in acid particles (%hesitation%) in the smoke
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324 14.74 26.18 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then that acid particles are cre (%hesitation%) carried by wind and became in some acid (%hesitation%) particles that fall as a dust
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324 26.18 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> other acid particles mix with cloud (%hesitation%) in winter and that fall in rain and snow
SI137O-00324-P50019 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think eating habits are important to improve a healthy life
SI137O-00324-P50019 1 SI137O-00324 6.53 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that the most important is eat fruit and vegetables that make you feel more comfortable with yourself and your body
SI137O-00324-P50020 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's very important to drink water because you can clean your body and you need to do it every single day
SI137O-00324-P50021 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 7.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i think do exercise is very important because it makes your body stronger

SI137O-00324-P50022 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 5.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i think it's very important to speak to sleep earlier
SI137O-00324-P50022 1 SI137O-00324 5.30 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) you need to sleep eight hours per day and if you didn't you going to be more weak
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324 0.00 4.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think both are correct
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324 4.11 11.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology brings you information that is very important to us to have a healthy life
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324 11.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but also you can find (%hesitation%) fake news that (%hesitation%) could be danger for us

SI137O-00382-P50023 1 SI137O-00382 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that is depend to the people because (%hesitation%) some technology help because (%hesitation%) you can to hear (%hesitation%) why to run or you can to use the technology to exercise in machines and other and other (co-) other things
SI137O-00388-P10005 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that there are many different reasons for learning about other countries but (%hesitation%) i think that the main reasons are the language and the culture the the culture that you can learn
SI137O-00388-P10006 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 11.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about sciences like physics
SI137O-00388-P10006 1 SI137O-00388 11.08 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and also of course i like to hang hang out with friends
SI137O-00388-P10007 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say that the best (be-) the the best way to improve my english is speaking speaking with friends and with people that only only can speak in english
SI137O-00388-P10008 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 6.54 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i definitely would learn to play an instrument
SI137O-00388-P10008 1 SI137O-00388 6.54 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really like the guitar and i would like to perform my favourite songs by pink floyd and other rock groups
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 6.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i would say that the advantage are very clear
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 6.32 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the students that have to work they have more money
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 15.70 22.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in this way they don't have to depend on their parents
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 22.91 35.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage i think that is the less time that they have to rest and to hanging out and to hang out with friends or something like that
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 35.50 47.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i would say that each person what (ha-) each person have to do what they what they want
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 47.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in this case i think that it is possible to do the two things at the same time so i don't see a problem
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 11.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first step in the production of the acid rain is the pollution that comes from factories and vehicles
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 11.74 29.78 <o,Q5,B2,P4> these pollution pass to the air and in the air the wind extend the pollution over all the sky extend and and transport the pollution
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 29.78 39.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in that situation some acid particles falls as dust contamining lakes
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 39.02 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles mix with cloud and fall in form of water damaging the trees and the environment
SI137O-00388-P50019 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 6.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> my advice is that people have to control their diet
SI137O-00388-P50019 1 SI137O-00388 6.63 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and for example they can consume meals and vegetables meals without fats and above all trying to avoiding sugar
SI137O-00388-P50020 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that drinking water is fundamental not only for keeping a healthy life lifestyle but it is fundamental for the life
SI137O-00388-P50021 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 6.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5> obviously i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day
SI137O-00388-P50021 1 SI137O-00388 6.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think that it is very important that you can do exercise the most times that you can
SI137O-00388-P50022 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i am agree with that because sleep well is essential to to be rested (%hesitation%) during your during your day and to perform the best of you in work and with your family
SI137O-00388-P50023 1 SI137O-00388 0.00 9.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that technology have neither positive nor negative consequences in our life
SI137O-00388-P50023 1 SI137O-00388 9.40 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that all these question depends on the use of each person do to technology
SI137O-00414-P10005 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i'm very interested
SI137O-00414-P10006 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i like to read books
SI137O-00414-P10007 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> practising more the speaking
SI137O-00414-P10008 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P1> speak english
SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 7.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) actually this is a complicated topic because (%hesitation%) of course you can find advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414 7.65 29.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantage is that the the student can get some experience in the time that he's studying but the (%hesitation%) disadvantage in my point of view it's that maybe (%hesitation%) this person can (lo-) lose the focus on the studies so this could be complicated
SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414 29.34 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my opinion i think that the part time job it should be related with the field that the person is studying then it's like it's giving experience and not just about working without a focus on the career on the yeah on the career that they want to to try to
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 17.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i do not have a huge experience regarding acid rain however from what i can see on the picture i can understand that the pollution came from the vehicles and the factories
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 17.40 23.99 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it goes up in the air and it could be carried from the wind
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 23.99 44.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so part of these particles will fall as a dust directed in the environment nearby and part of these can be mixed with the cloud waters and then it's the way where the acid rain it's formed
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 44.72 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is gonna damage could be damage the the environment a little bit far than when it's it's carried just as a dust
SI137O-00414-P50019 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the advice that i can give the people who wants to have (%hesitation%) better eating habits is that they should increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that they are eating and reduce the amount of sugar
SI137O-00414-P50020 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> drink water i mean i don't have any scientific top to to say about it but i can assure that it's good for your kidney healthy and so on
SI137O-00414-P50021 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 11.24 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i do believe that doing exercise daily it's is a way to improve your health not just your body health but also your mental health
SI137O-00414-P50021 1 SI137O-00414 11.24 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so for me that's something everyone should do in a daily basis
SI137O-00414-P50022 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 15.19 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that in my case for example i do need eight hours of sleep every night however maybe can maybe can exist people who needs less and i think it's fine
SI137O-00414-P50022 1 SI137O-00414 15.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that people should boo sleep as much as they need
SI137O-00414-P50023 1 SI137O-00414 0.00 8.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the technology (%hesitation%) topics it's like depends of the way that the people are using technology
SI137O-00414-P50023 1 SI137O-00414 8.89 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i mean everythings in life needs balance and also the technology
SI137O-00414-P50023 1 SI137O-00414 13.63 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think technology it's great for health because can increase the
SI137O-00417-P10005 1 SI137O-00417 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i'm pretty interested about learning about other countries (%hesitation%) about different cultures and the (%hesitation%) different traditions that they have there
SI137O-00417-P10006 1 SI137O-00417 0.00 12.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) i don't have that much of free time but i would like to spend it with my friends and family (%hesitation%) loved ones in general

SI137O-00417-P30017 1 SI137O-00417 0.00 20.80 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) well the advantages of (%hesitation%) working students students working is that (%hesitation%) they could have an extra money (%hesitation%) for what they need and the it's it will help them with the money
SI137O-00417-P30017 1 SI137O-00417 20.80 44.11 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) the disadvantages is that are that (%hesitation%) they would have less time for for example doing their homeworks or they would (%hesitation%) be tired in the end of the day and they will have less energy to do their homeworks and study (%hesitation%) for the university

SI137O-00417-P30017 1 SI137O-00417 54.92 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> you know it's kind of necessary for living to work and (st-)
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 0.00 9.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well this is a diagram that how factories and vehicles can cause damage to environments
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 9.73 20.93 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all they (%hesitation%) make this pollution which has acid particles in this smoke
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 20.93 28.78 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the wind can carry these acid particles (%hesitation%) through the air
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 28.78 39.55 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some of these particles (%hesitation%) fall down as dust and may (%hesitation%) pollute the water
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 39.55 53.43 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some other (%hesitation%) will go through the clouds and will make acidic water (%hesitation%) which comes down to the ground as rain or snow
SI137O-00417-P40018 1 SI137O-00417 53.43 60.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so they would (%hesitation%) make the soil and the environments
SI137O-00417-P50019 1 SI137O-00417 0.00 6.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would definitely (%hesitation%) say people that (%hesitation%) do not skip the breakfast

SI137O-00456-P50020 1 SI137O-00456 0.00 2.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think i think so
SI137O-00456-P50020 1 SI137O-00456 2.70 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) face to face is is the logical way to to study and the the teacher can correct you in at the moment and they can find a way you study better

SI137O-00456-P50022 1 SI137O-00456 16.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) lectures are
SI137O-00456-P50023 1 SI137O-00456 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important (to-) today because (%hesitation%) facilities are improving (%hesitation%) day by day and you have to (pro-) to to know (%hesitation%) the news (%hesitation%) technologies for learning
SI137O-00458-P10005 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very much interested about learning other countries
SI137O-00458-P10006 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy my free time by watching netflix

SI137O-00458-P30017 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 15.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> according to me university students should do part time jobs while they're studying but some students are just want to study they don't want to do part time jobs
SI137O-00458-P30017 1 SI137O-00458 15.66 23.71 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the advantages are they can save more money for their future and for their future studies
SI137O-00458-P30017 1 SI137O-00458 23.71 33.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and sometimes there are dist like disadvantages because they don't find much time to get their studies
SI137O-00458-P30017 1 SI137O-00458 33.62 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion (%hesitation%) doing a job with studying is very much beneficial and it also motivates the student and also (boo-) boost up the student's level and he or she feels more independent
SI137O-00458-P40018 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 23.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> according to me as we can see acid rain is very much dangerous because it causes the air pollution through the vehicles and in and you can see some of the acid particles are carried away in the smoke
SI137O-00458-P40018 1 SI137O-00458 23.30 34.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and through the wind it goes to the (%hesitation%) water and damage the environment with dust and particles
SI137O-00458-P40018 1 SI137O-00458 34.30 53.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and some of the dust particles involve into the clouds and through that clouds the acid particles from (%hesitation%) it's very snowy and rainy and that damage the environment and also the human society
SI137O-00458-P40018 1 SI137O-00458 53.25 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so it is very bad in nature
SI137O-00458-P50019 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 7.18 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my advice i would like to tell about something on eating eating habits
SI137O-00458-P50019 1 SI137O-00458 7.18 15.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's like they have to eat very proper food without oily without spicy and over fatty foods
SI137O-00458-P50019 1 SI137O-00458 15.88 17.25 <o,Q5,C,P5> they have to avoid that
SI137O-00458-P50019 1 SI137O-00458 17.25 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> and eating on time is very
SI137O-00458-P50020 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 11.14 <o,Q5,C,P5> drinking lots of water increases the immunity even skin it glows the skin and you can feel very much energetic
SI137O-00458-P50020 1 SI137O-00458 11.14 15.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it will it will also maintain your water level in your body
SI137O-00458-P50020 1 SI137O-00458 15.77 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so drinking water is very beneficials of one health
SI137O-00458-P50021 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> yes it is very much essential to do some basic exercises because by doing some kind of fitting exercises anyone can feel energetic happy and the body will will be flexible all the day
SI137O-00458-P50022 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 10.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> yes according to me also sleeping eight hours is a very good hobby or it's a very good thing and every everyone should take this sleep
SI137O-00458-P50022 1 SI137O-00458 10.36 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> at least if they are not doing it so at least seven hours or six hours is also very important for a person's mental health or also physical health
SI137O-00458-P50023 1 SI137O-00458 0.00 15.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> technology always is a good thing because we are we are knowing about the different technologies we are increasing our economical growth also and through technologies we can easily talk to each other
SI137O-00458-P50023 1 SI137O-00458 15.04 20.00 <o,Q4,C,P5> so it's a good good thing but if it use in a good manner
SI137O-00459-P10005 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i interest by (%hesitation%) culture and language and traditions and people in general
SI137O-00459-P10006 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 5.74 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i really really really like it watch movies or series
SI137O-00459-P10006 1 SI137O-00459 5.74 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like (%hesitation%) the k dramas like k series and sometimes read books
SI137O-00459-P10007 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 8.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well actually (%hesitation%) watch movies or series in english for practice
SI137O-00459-P10007 1 SI137O-00459 8.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00459-P10008 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i will like someday (%hesitation%) to learn speak korean but i need to learn english first because most of the materials are in english so i need (sp-) learn english
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 13.55 <o,Q3,B1,P3> first of all i think that i am an expert in this topic because i have a friend who do part time jobs and she are studying right now
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 13.55 28.36 <o,Q3,B1,P3> so i see see (%hesitation%) say she what difficult is to do part time jobs while you're a student and what are the advantage
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 28.36 34.51 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think that one advantage it's that you have more money for pay your studies
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 34.51 37.37 <o,Q3,B1,P3> but what are the disadvantage
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 37.37 44.58 <o,Q3,B1,P3> that you don't have enough time to focus on your studies so it's difficult
SI137O-00459-P30017 1 SI137O-00459 44.58 60.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that it's not a good idea (%hesitation%) found or search part time jobs while you are a student because you have to focus on your studies right now
SI137O-00459-P40018 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 25.43 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the pollution is a serial problem in our world and the worst part is that we we are part of this because all the pollution (%hesitation%) begin in the factories or vehicles
SI137O-00459-P40018 1 SI137O-00459 25.43 33.23 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if this pollutions go in acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00459-P40018 1 SI137O-00459 33.23 38.73 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so they have two steps
SI137O-00459-P40018 1 SI137O-00459 38.73 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> one of them is some acid particles fall as a dust over lakes and seas and other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are rain or snow and they're so evil for our planet
SI137O-00459-P50019 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 12.62 <o,Q4,B1,P5> actually i'm not the right person to give advice of eating habits to other people because i think that i don't have good (%hesitation%) habits with the food
SI137O-00459-P50019 1 SI137O-00459 12.62 18.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but i think that one advice is that you eat balanced
SI137O-00459-P50019 1 SI137O-00459 18.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah that's
SI137O-00459-P50020 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 11.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very very important to drink water all of day because our brain needs water to work good
SI137O-00459-P50020 1 SI137O-00459 11.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think that actually we have to drink two litres of the
SI137O-00459-P50021 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 4.31 <o,Q4,B1,P5> well i think not every day because it's too much
SI137O-00459-P50021 1 SI137O-00459 4.31 18.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> there yeah it's important do exercise some days of the weekend like the three or two or four days on the week
SI137O-00459-P50021 1 SI137O-00459 18.04 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that it's important do
SI137O-00459-P50022 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in mexico people says you need seven hours to sleep to have a good rest where in my opinion it's very important have a rest to work good one of day
SI137O-00459-P50023 1 SI137O-00459 0.00 14.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that it's fifty fifty because technology has good things but i think that have bad things too
SI137O-00459-P50023 1 SI137O-00459 14.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00492-P10005 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 12.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i interested because of many things even cultural expressions some interesting places that i would love to visit maybe
SI137O-00492-P10005 1 SI137O-00492 12.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it could be a good plan for me maybe at the future
SI137O-00492-P10006 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 4.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy (%hesitation%) spending my free time reading
SI137O-00492-P10006 1 SI137O-00492 4.41 7.10 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to reading novels
SI137O-00492-P10006 1 SI137O-00492 7.10 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> especially i like to visit my parents and spending my time with my family and you know with friends and maybe watching some series and listening to music
SI137O-00492-P10007 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 4.79 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the best way for me to improve my english is reading
SI137O-00492-P10007 1 SI137O-00492 4.79 11.36 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think reading is the best way to or to (li-) to listening is a good way too
SI137O-00492-P10007 1 SI137O-00492 11.36 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) watching some series and obviously like trying to do this speaking with a different person even when is a robot
SI137O-00492-P10008 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 2.09 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it would be painting
SI137O-00492-P10008 1 SI137O-00492 2.09 10.52 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i love painting frames but i'm no (l-) as good as an artist but i like like the different colors
SI137O-00492-P10008 1 SI137O-00492 10.52 14.71 <o,Q4,B1,P1> painting i would love to do it and and improve that skills
SI137O-00492-P10008 1 SI137O-00492 14.71 16.37 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's artistic
SI137O-00492-P10008 1 SI137O-00492 16.37 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it could be an excellent skill to have
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 17.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> as my point of view the advantage for students (%hesitation%) doing part time jobs is that they have their money to do many things or maybe buy commodities i don't know to paying that
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 17.04 28.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> that is important because you know that students most of the time are running out of money and they need to buy their own clothes or maybe things that they need
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 28.07 47.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the disadvantages is that you are worrying about they are worrying about many things like working produce money doing many things and not (%hesitation%) investing time and preparing theirselves to to the maybe get that degree or something related to that
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 47.65 50.39 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) that is my opinion
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 50.39 54.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think is important to get like (%hesitation%) experience
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 54.13 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> that is a really important part
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 4.55 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this is my presentation about acid rain
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 4.55 10.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and at the beginning acid rain is produced by factories and vehicles
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 10.80 21.31 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) you know that this liberate or get pollution to the air and then these acid particles are in form of smoke
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 21.31 28.91 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the wind moves this (a-) acid particles (y-) (%hesitation%) or this acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 28.91 37.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some of this fall as a dust and others mix with a water in the cloud water for example
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 37.80 48.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the situation of this is this (%hesitation%) acid rain move over the world and the (%hesitation%) (a-) atmosphere that it moves with the with the wind for example
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 48.38 55.88 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then get down as a rain you know or snow and that could be damage the environment
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 55.88 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> that is the situation
SI137O-00492-P50019 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 7.79 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) thinking in what they are eating is the most important you know like the quantity of food
SI137O-00492-P50019 1 SI137O-00492 7.79 14.39 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there include like more vegetables or maybe more healthy (%hesitation%) eat
SI137O-00492-P50019 1 SI137O-00492 14.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> is important to create this kind of a (hea-) a healthy habit
SI137O-00492-P50020 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 2.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is really important
SI137O-00492-P50020 1 SI137O-00492 2.11 11.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as i as far as i know (%hesitation%) people (%hesitation%) would drink like two litres of water per day
SI137O-00492-P50020 1 SI137O-00492 11.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't like drinking too much water but i know that is necessary to moisturise your skin and everything
SI137O-00492-P50021 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 6.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as my point of view doing exercise will be enough like three times per week
SI137O-00492-P50021 1 SI137O-00492 6.75 17.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> according with many specialists that will be good for your muscles and to keep (y-) moving your body it will be do (%hesitation%) good sorry
SI137O-00492-P50021 1 SI137O-00492 17.60 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> just that
SI137O-00492-P50022 1 SI137O-00492 0.00 2.15 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that is correct

SI137O-00512-P30017 1 SI137O-00512 0.00 5.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i have nothing against university university students doing part time jobs
SI137O-00512-P30017 1 SI137O-00512 5.69 8.34 <o,Q4,B2,P3> actually it's very good for them

SI137O-00512-P30017 1 SI137O-00512 24.73 32.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> then in though after graduating when they find jobs they already have experiences
SI137O-00512-P30017 1 SI137O-00512 32.57 43.61 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and ya disadvantages of course (%hesitation%) most of them doesn't have enough time to study or to sleep and to rest well
SI137O-00512-P30017 1 SI137O-00512 43.61 49.79 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my own opinion it's an advantage

SI137O-00512-P40018 1 SI137O-00512 21.41 26.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and it also contributes to the (%hesitation%) pollution to the environment
SI137O-00512-P40018 1 SI137O-00512 26.70 37.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and also some acid particles are mixed with cloud water so you know when it rains it it pours acid rains
SI137O-00512-P40018 1 SI137O-00512 37.80 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that is how acid rain (%hesitation%) created

SI137O-00534-P50020 1 SI137O-00534 9.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so as (m-) much water as you drink better health you will have
SI137O-00534-P50021 1 SI137O-00534 0.00 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my personal case i practice sport five or six days at week so if i were them i will do at least three or four times a week
SI137O-00534-P50022 1 SI137O-00534 0.00 7.93 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that it's an amount that it's unbelievable
SI137O-00534-P50022 1 SI137O-00534 7.93 17.98 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my case i sleep from six to seven hours and i rest
SI137O-00534-P50022 1 SI137O-00534 17.98 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think that with seven
SI137O-00534-P50023 1 SI137O-00534 0.00 12.27 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that in a balance because it has its good things and worse things
SI137O-00534-P50023 1 SI137O-00534 12.27 16.31 <o,Q4,B1,P5> for example take phone
SI137O-00534-P50023 1 SI137O-00534 16.31 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in many hours in our hand is

SI137O-00565-P10006 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> on holidays i like to spend my time on running and making some cuisines and cleaning out of cleaning my rooms and (%hesitation%) washing in the laundry
SI137O-00565-P10007 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 3.07 <o,Q4,B1,P1> oh it's a difficult questions
SI137O-00565-P10007 1 SI137O-00565 3.07 8.15 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i can enjoy (%hesitation%) with my family every each family
SI137O-00565-P10007 1 SI137O-00565 8.15 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) the mostly my wife is a person that i love to spend with
SI137O-00565-P10008 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 13.17 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i want to be a runner some private firm (%hesitation%) in (%hesitation%) different perspectives like engineering in financing
SI137O-00565-P10008 1 SI137O-00565 13.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and (%hesitation%) that's it
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 7.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> okay let me explain the the jobs
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 7.87 11.85 <o,Q4,B2,P3> all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 11.85 28.12 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think the advantages to all the students should get the jobs to pay for their university studies is to know the variety of works and jobs (%hesitation%) before going into our society
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 28.12 39.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and second one and the (di-) disadvantages of the those activity is to lose their time to study in their university
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 39.70 42.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is the middle
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 42.29 55.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so every students have to do their jobs (%hesitation%) for some extent of (%hesitation%) to pay for their university study at least partially not everything
SI137O-00565-P30017 1 SI137O-00565 55.66 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but (%hesitation%) those experience will benefit of
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 10.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> ok let me explain how to travel by airplane how to how to do (%hesitation%) to go by airplane
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 10.29 19.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so first you have to do is to travel to airport by car or bus or public transportation to reach the airport
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 19.72 27.07 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after getting to airport you have to go to in check in counter to check in in the table
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 27.07 39.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that you will going to the document control station and to check (%hesitation%) your documents (%hesitation%) as you have to bes good to board that plane
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 39.42 45.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then go to security to your hand bags and other thing
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 45.00 54.65 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after security you're going to wait for some (%hesitation%) minutes or some hours to before boarding boarding the plane
SI137O-00565-P40018 1 SI137O-00565 54.65 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after boarding the train the plane will go to your destination
SI137O-00565-P50019 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 7.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in order to be more effective to learn (%hesitation%) to study the technology can help
SI137O-00565-P50019 1 SI137O-00565 7.82 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (tech-) technology can prioritise or personalise the method of how to study the new things
SI137O-00565-P50020 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 2.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree the opinion too
SI137O-00565-P50020 1 SI137O-00565 2.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best to to speak with the teacher in face to face because (%hesitation%) the part of the communication most part of the communication is not (%hesitation%) verbal but (%hesitation%) your attitude and (%hesitation%) body languages
SI137O-00565-P50021 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the communication skills and the motivation skills will be developed through (%hesitation%) (co-) group projects
SI137O-00565-P50022 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> im my opinion attending lectures are important and more effective for studying because (%hesitation%) being attending (%hesitation%) in the lectures you can communicate with teachers and your colleagues in the class
SI137O-00565-P50023 1 SI137O-00565 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's quite important for a university to modern facilities for learning because in the modern world the technology is developing speed for the technology is quite (r-) fast (%hesitation%) fast so it's a very important thing
SI137O-00566-P10005 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> interested about the countries about the food and cultures and activities (%hesitation%) and way of life in the other (%hesitation%)

SI137O-00566-P10007 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think (%hesitation%) the best way is practice every day (%hesitation%) the language and grammatic (%hesitation%) and listening the videos (%hesitation%) in in english
SI137O-00566-P30017 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 18.34 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think the advantages is about the responsibilities because (%hesitation%) the students ha development new skills on the (%hesitation%) the works
SI137O-00566-P30017 1 SI137O-00566 18.34 31.24 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) i think the disadvantin disadvantage is (%hesitation%) about the time and the qualification of finally the courses
SI137O-00566-P30017 1 SI137O-00566 31.24 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion (%hesitation%) it is necessary (%hesitation%) the students (%hesitation%) learning (%hesitation%) equilibrate (%hesitation%) both (%hesitation%) (ar-) areas the students and jobs (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) have experience in the work but is is students
SI137O-00566-P40018 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 14.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the environmenting pollution are consequently about the (%hesitation%) different pollution source as (%hesitation%) factory bicycles and we humans
SI137O-00566-P40018 1 SI137O-00566 14.00 31.36 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the pollution produces (%hesitation%) acid rained and that is (%hesitation%) consequently the particulate acid particulate (%hesitation%) in the wind
SI137O-00566-P40018 1 SI137O-00566 31.36 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) the acid rained affect the plants water (%hesitation%) and the quality life of the humans the animals and (%hesitation%) other species (%hesitation%) in the in the earth

SI137O-00566-P50020 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it is fundamental in the (%hesitation%) healthy (li-) living because the water is necessary for for functionality of the (%hesitation%) body in order the activities
SI137O-00566-P50021 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 14.57 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think the workout is fundamental (%hesitation%) for the healthy living but (%hesitation%) i think the body need a rest (%hesitation%) sometimes
SI137O-00566-P50021 1 SI137O-00566 14.57 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) but but the doing exercise is important
SI137O-00566-P50022 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 17.43 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that is true (%hesitation%) but sometime (%hesitation%) it is difficult (%hesitation%) to keep all the seven and eight hours in the night
SI137O-00566-P50022 1 SI137O-00566 17.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but it is (%hesitation%) through
SI137O-00566-P50023 1 SI137O-00566 0.00 5.98 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it's a positive (%hesitation%) in the people's health
SI137O-00566-P50023 1 SI137O-00566 5.98 9.64 <o,Q4,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) depend of the use

SI137O-00566-P50023 1 SI137O-00566 16.39 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but but fundamentally it's positive
SI137O-00569-P10005 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i am very very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
SI137O-00569-P10006 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my free time i like to watch movies read some books go to the beach go to the park with my daughters
SI137O-00569-P10007 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think the best way to improve my english is speaking and learning (%hesitation%) all about the grammar and trying to speak with other persons
SI137O-00569-P10008 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> at this moment i'm trying to learn to be a pilot
SI137O-00569-P30017 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 10.79 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) in my opinion there is no disadvantages in working part time while studying in university
SI137O-00569-P30017 1 SI137O-00569 10.79 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> this is because the students can be in touch with native and practise their listening and improving your language (%hesitation%) going on the the culture of the countries
SI137O-00569-P40018 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 15.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> to begin with we can see in these pictures vehicles and factories emitting carbon dioxide causing pollution and emitting acid particles in the smoke
SI137O-00569-P40018 1 SI137O-00569 15.14 28.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles goes down as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI137O-00569-P40018 1 SI137O-00569 28.31 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the acid particles (%hesitation%) goes down in rain or snow and causes damage to the environment
SI137O-00569-P50019 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 13.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for the people who wants to develop good habits about eating the first thing to do is forgetting the junk food
SI137O-00569-P50019 1 SI137O-00569 13.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is the worst thing to the human body
SI137O-00569-P50020 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is very very important to drink water all day long because all of our systems our body systems needs water to work in the correct way
SI137O-00569-P50021 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 10.70 <o,Q5,B2,P5> of course doing exercise is very important for maintain the healthy of your body
SI137O-00569-P50021 1 SI137O-00569 10.70 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but doing exercise every day could be very difficult for some people
SI137O-00569-P50022 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 7.78 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there is no magic number of time of sleeping every day
SI137O-00569-P50022 1 SI137O-00569 7.78 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> what you have to think is each one have your personal time to sleep and feel healthy in the next day
SI137O-00569-P50023 1 SI137O-00569 0.00 5.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> there are many ways to think about this question
SI137O-00569-P50023 1 SI137O-00569 5.30 13.19 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in one way technology (%hesitation%) has improved the healthy treatments
SI137O-00569-P50023 1 SI137O-00569 13.19 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and the other hand the technology has taken taken away
SI137O-00570-P10005 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i find it very interesting to know about their cultures or their architecture (%hesitation%) and i enjoy to travel to other countries
SI137O-00570-P10006 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 3.42 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i enjoy my free time with my cat

SI137O-00570-P10006 1 SI137O-00570 5.30 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> also i design some clothes and make these clothes with technique of crochet
SI137O-00570-P10007 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 9.36 <o,Q3,B2,P1> in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing with other people that know the language
SI137O-00570-P10007 1 SI137O-00570 9.36 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> also i believe that writing and reading some text is useful
SI137O-00570-P10008 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 20.00 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i would learn about the grammar and also i would like (%hesitation%) feel more comfortable when i'm improve my english
SI137O-00570-P30017 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 21.86 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i believe that evidently have a part time jobs (%hesitation%) has advantage such as the personal develop or have the opportunity to learn so many many type of of of themes
SI137O-00570-P30017 1 SI137O-00570 21.86 41.04 <o,Q4,C,P3> (%hesitation%) but (%hesitation%) it has (%hesitation%) actually some disadvantage (%hesitation%) such as loss of time time of of enjoying time (%hesitation%) such as having a free time for our friends or something like that
SI137O-00570-P30017 1 SI137O-00570 41.04 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> but nonetheless i i believe that my own opinion is that it has more advantage that disadvantage because it is a great opportunity to find a
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 8.46 <o,Q4,C,P4> this is a presentation about an actual issue that is the formation of acid rain
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 8.46 12.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> it is caused by vehicles or factories
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 12.04 24.72 <o,Q4,C,P4> then these elements forms the pollution and this pollution (%hesitation%) form acid particles that they are in in the smoke
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 24.72 33.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> (%hesitation%) then in the three step this acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 33.22 37.23 <o,Q4,C,P4> and in this part we have two options
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 37.23 44.76 <o,Q4,C,P4> first some acid particles fall as dust but other particles mix with cold water
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 44.76 49.64 <o,Q4,C,P4> therefore (%hesitation%) this acid particles are in rain or snow
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 49.64 53.75 <o,Q4,C,P4> and it causes damage to our environment
SI137O-00570-P40018 1 SI137O-00570 53.75 60.00 <o,Q4,C,P4> this is (%hesitation%) an important issue and actually is the the most important
SI137O-00570-P50019 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 6.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion having a good lifestyle starts since our eating habits
SI137O-00570-P50019 1 SI137O-00570 6.77 16.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so personally i could say that consult with a specialist is the best way to start with these good eating habits
SI137O-00570-P50019 1 SI137O-00570 16.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and a specialist could give us the
SI137O-00570-P50020 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 9.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as far as i know experts recommend that in our daily routine we should drink a minimum of two water litres
SI137O-00570-P50020 1 SI137O-00570 9.77 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i i believe that it is really important in our lifestyle because it apports to our
SI137O-00570-P50021 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 5.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah in my opinion the exercise is the best way to keeping healthy
SI137O-00570-P50021 1 SI137O-00570 5.43 13.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> doing exercise have a lot of advantage such as loss mass as well as keep a good lifestyle
SI137O-00570-P50021 1 SI137O-00570 13.80 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i believe that it is (%hesitation%) a part really important that
SI137O-00570-P50022 1 SI137O-00570 0.00 8.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> as far as i know experts recommend that have about six to eight hours to sleep is enough

SI137O-00594-P40018 1 SI137O-00594 29.23 42.16 <o,Q5,A2,P4> and then the particles is from pollution and then it's carried by wind
SI137O-00594-P40018 1 SI137O-00594 42.16 53.40 <o,Q5,A2,P4> and then (trans-) so take some transformation and it's transform into cloud water

SI137O-00608-P10005 1 SI137O-00608 10.89 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for example on weekends i always go to the streets to pick up some bottles with

SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 7.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> now i'm going to talking about the students (%hesitation%) do fitness classes in the college
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 7.06 25.21 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion the advantages of doing (%hesitation%) fitness classes are it will not only (%hesitation%) stress the students' bodies but also (%hesitation%) they can be more active and they will do their schoolwork more effectively
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 25.21 30.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the (dis-) (%hesitation%) the disadvantages are obviously too
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 30.98 38.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first some students may not fit for their fitness classes (%hesitation%) because they have a weak body
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 38.75 46.44 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and then it they will get hurt in the fitness classes
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 46.44 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i recommend the fitness classes in the colleges (%hesitation%) because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their school
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 5.24 <o,Q4,B1,P4> today i'm going to talk about how honey is produced
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 5.24 9.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all the bees will collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 9.87 16.28 <o,Q4,B1,P4> (%hesitation%) then in the beehives (%hesitation%) the bees (%hesitation%) make honey from nectar together
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 16.28 23.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when the honey is formed the beekeepers will collect honey from beehives
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 23.92 32.71 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then (%hesitation%) the beekeepers will pour the honey into bottles
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 32.71 47.79 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then after that (%hesitation%) there are some vehicles transform (%hesitation%) the bottoms of (%hesitation%) honey to the shops
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 47.79 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally on the shops will give the price and put them into the case so we can buy them
SI137O-00608-P50019 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion they should consider about the fees when studying abroad and the conception level because the money is the most important thing and the locals' different culture is important too
SI137O-00608-P50020 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think having a good command of second language will help you have a better communication with other people in their countries and when you in different countries you will be (%hesitation%) speak easily to other people
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 12.82 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion i think the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother language for most students studying abroad
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 12.82 17.43 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and the second one is the local different culture
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 17.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very different from us
SI137O-00608-P50022 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think they can learn the local culture by reading some books which about (%hesitation%) local histories and they will also go to the internet and search some information about the history
SI137O-00608-P50023 1 SI137O-00608 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with them because when you study abroad just yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and something else

SI137O-00618-P10006 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 19.22 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm enjoy my free time by playing video games because i think that i am in another world where i can be somewhere else and have a (d-) a (%hesitation%) have an interesting adventure that (wh-) where i can development in the in the story of that video game
SI137O-00618-P10006 1 SI137O-00618 19.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so yeah
SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 5.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way to learn english is by listening broadway musicals
SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618 5.79 18.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is important to listen music but i think broadway musical can use difficult structure that you can you can emit or mimic them so you could improve it
SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618 18.96 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and (ma-)
SI137O-00618-P10008 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 11.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that i would like to learn how to drive because in my town there's a lot of traffic so it is difficult to move on to one place to another one
SI137O-00618-P10008 1 SI137O-00618 11.14 18.27 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so for example i'm not ready to work for that reason because i am live far from other places
SI137O-00618-P10008 1 SI137O-00618 18.27 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i live close
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 14.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think that part time jobs are a good idea where students from university could learn new skills that they couldn't learn in in the school
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 14.32 29.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so for example i think some advantages are some areas of those advantages are you could talk better and you have confidence when you have are have a presentation
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 29.62 39.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you could talk about business and you could develop your your your (finan-) financial life
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 39.75 44.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for other part some disadvantages is that you are more busy
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 44.82 53.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you don't have time to spend your with your free time or you can spend with social with social things
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 53.02 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion i think that is important to have a balance your life
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 17.23 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it is dreadful that the water that we are drinking it could be acid if factories and vehicles affect because they make some gases and those gases are pollution
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 17.23 22.10 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the smoke of those gases could be mixed with acid particles
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 22.10 35.26 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and those acid particles can be carried by the wind and that in the wind the the particles can fall as a dust and other ones could be mixed with the cloud
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 35.26 38.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and those and the clouds are water
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 38.70 40.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i could say that
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 40.14 55.08 <o,Q4,B2,P4> but the (worry-) the (dreadf-) the dread part of that is (c-) mixed with the clouds is that it's coz the rain and the snow could falling as an acid rain
SI137O-00618-P40018 1 SI137O-00618 55.08 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and it'll affect the environmental like trees health and (o-)

SI137O-00618-P50019 1 SI137O-00618 6.58 11.65 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to meat fish or something that can bring you protein
SI137O-00618-P50019 1 SI137O-00618 11.65 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and you also have to eat fruits and vegetables and preferably you have to eat dish (abo-) of different color
SI137O-00618-P50020 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 7.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i am not sure at all but i think that the minimum that you must have to drink is three liters of water
SI137O-00618-P50020 1 SI137O-00618 7.59 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but if you are a sports trainer you must have to drink more than three liters of water because it will be affect your brain or your training if you don't drink
SI137O-00618-P50021 1 SI137O-00618 0.00 7.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) i think that is important to make exercise and also is important to organise your schedule
SI137O-00618-P50021 1 SI137O-00618 7.04 11.99 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example you have to do minimum three hours per week
SI137O-00618-P50021 1 SI137O-00618 11.99 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so for (exam-) (%hesitation%) i rather to do one hour per day and the other four days i don't do (exerci-)

SI137O-00759-P50019 1 SI137O-00759 5.22 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can search additional information and also they can read the (%hesitation%) different researches about this topic
SI137O-00759-P50020 1 SI137O-00759 0.00 10.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that (%hesitation%) studying face to face with their teacher is essential because he may (%hesitation%) check you
SI137O-00759-P50020 1 SI137O-00759 10.85 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and he can improve your knowledge by (%hesitation%) using useful
SI137O-00759-P50021 1 SI137O-00759 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that students can develop cooperation and communication when working in when working together on group project because they study to listen each other
SI137O-00759-P50022 1 SI137O-00759 0.00 7.25 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think that attending lectures is more useful than learning alone
SI137O-00759-P50022 1 SI137O-00759 7.25 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can do this online by yourself and it will be (%hesitation%) so good as attending lectures if you do it responsibly
SI137O-00759-P50023 1 SI137O-00759 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it is very important to provide (%hesitation%) modern learning facilities in the universities because nowadays in the world of (%hesitation%) high improved technology it is so important (%hesitation%) to have (%hesitation%) the modern techniques
SI137O-00769-P10005 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 13.61 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm interesting about (%hesitation%) culture language and (%hesitation%) food
SI137O-00769-P10005 1 SI137O-00769 13.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i interesting
SI137O-00769-P10006 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm spending my free time (%hesitation%) to do some exercise or to read (%hesitation%) some books for example
SI137O-00769-P10006 1 SI137O-00769 14.77 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> (%hesitation%) i like it
SI137O-00769-P10007 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i think (%hesitation%) is to see some films in original version for example in english or to talk with a native (%hesitation%) (per-)

SI137O-00769-P30017 1 SI137O-00769 2.36 13.21 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and i (%hesitation%) i am going to talk about (%hesitation%) the part time jobs while they are studying
SI137O-00769-P30017 1 SI137O-00769 13.21 47.35 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example one in my opinion one (%hesitation%) advantage (%hesitation%) is that the students (%hesitation%) they we will be improve (%hesitation%) they they they jobs they abilities (%hesitation%) during working and improve for example your your language or
SI137O-00769-P30017 1 SI137O-00769 47.35 58.81 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and on other the other on the other hand one disadvantage is (%hesitation%) perhaps they have less time to study
SI137O-00769-P30017 1 SI137O-00769 58.81 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and
SI137O-00769-P40018 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 14.09 <o,Q5,B1,P4> first of all (%hesitation%) the infography (%hesitation%) show us about (%hesitation%) acid rain
SI137O-00769-P40018 1 SI137O-00769 14.09 26.80 <o,Q5,B1,P4> for example first the factories rise the pollution with (%hesitation%) smoke particles
SI137O-00769-P40018 1 SI137O-00769 26.80 39.03 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then the wind transport these particles inside the clouds polluting them
SI137O-00769-P40018 1 SI137O-00769 39.03 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and (%hesitation%) then when rain or snow the particles are in rain or snow fell fall through trees
SI137O-00769-P50019 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion to have good habits is drink more water vegetables less fat for example to to doing (exer-)
SI137O-00769-P50020 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for me is very important (%hesitation%) to you should to drink water more or less two or three liters for day
SI137O-00769-P50021 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 11.40 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion is very important to do exercise every day perhaps one day to rest
SI137O-00769-P50021 1 SI137O-00769 11.40 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but to do exercise (i-) (%hesitation%) more or less six days six days is very important
SI137O-00769-P50022 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 5.35 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think i agree with with the question
SI137O-00769-P50022 1 SI137O-00769 5.35 16.21 <o,Q5,B1,P5> is very important to sleep (%hesitation%) more or less eight hours at night
SI137O-00769-P50022 1 SI137O-00769 16.21 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for this reason your body is better
SI137O-00769-P50023 1 SI137O-00769 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for me is very positive to do some works some about my p c or laptop to learn other people throughout
SI137O-00798-P10005 1 SI137O-00798 0.00 7.53 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm really interested to learn about canada because i moved to canada a few years ago

SI137O-00798-P10006 1 SI137O-00798 17.06 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i think

SI137O-00798-P30017 1 SI137O-00798 0.00 17.68 <o,Q4,A2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they have more advantages
SI137O-00798-P30017 1 SI137O-00798 17.68 47.91 <o,Q4,A2,P3> they gain experience but they have some disadvantages because they don't have much time to study more
SI137O-00798-P30017 1 SI137O-00798 47.91 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P3> if they have some homework or a project they don't have much
SI137O-00798-P40018 1 SI137O-00798 0.00 31.17 <o,Q4,A2,P4> the acidy rains are caused because (%hesitation%) of factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) emit some gases
SI137O-00798-P40018 1 SI137O-00798 31.17 41.13 <o,Q4,A2,P4> and this pollution form (aci-) acid particles in the smoke
SI137O-00798-P40018 1 SI137O-00798 41.13 48.06 <o,Q4,A2,P4> and (%hesitation%) it transform in acid particles and carried by wind
SI137O-00798-P40018 1 SI137O-00798 48.06 52.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> and some acidy particles falls as dust
SI137O-00798-P40018 1 SI137O-00798 52.00 56.66 <o,Q4,A2,P4> and others acidy particles mix with clouds cloud water

SI137O-00800-P30017 1 SI137O-00800 9.93 26.62 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some of them are the student will have extra money and experience about their job so they they can be responsible and honest
SI137O-00800-P30017 1 SI137O-00800 26.62 35.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantage of this they don't have enough time to study their exams and do the homework
SI137O-00800-P30017 1 SI137O-00800 35.86 48.51 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion if you don't have enough time it's necessary to organisate and try to do work try to give the best of you

SI137O-00800-P40018 1 SI137O-00800 0.00 6.64 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the acid rain is the sum of the factories' affect to the environment
SI137O-00800-P40018 1 SI137O-00800 6.64 10.99 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this because the factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI137O-00800-P40018 1 SI137O-00800 10.99 17.66 <o,Q5,B1,P4> in in that way produce acid particles are in the smoke in the atmosphere
SI137O-00800-P40018 1 SI137O-00800 17.66 26.29 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so the wind carry these particles across the the two groups

SI137O-00803-P50020 1 SI137O-00803 7.62 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) so we should (%hesitation%) drink (%hesitation%) more water (%hesitation%) regularly (%hesitation%) during the day
SI137O-00803-P50021 1 SI137O-00803 0.00 6.99 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well i think (%hesitation%) we should do exercise regularly
SI137O-00803-P50021 1 SI137O-00803 6.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) i don't think every day but (%hesitation%) i think twice a week (%hesitation%) or (thr-) (%hesitation%) three times a week or more
SI137O-00803-P50022 1 SI137O-00803 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) sleep seven or eight hours a day is very important to be (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) healthy
SI137O-00803-P50023 1 SI137O-00803 0.00 9.93 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think technology is (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (i-) is bad or is good for people
SI137O-00803-P50023 1 SI137O-00803 9.93 15.72 <o,Q5,B1,P5> (%hesitation%) it depends of the used people do (%hesitation%) of technology
SI137O-00803-P50023 1 SI137O-00803 15.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> we should use technology (%hesitation%) less than
SI137O-00857-P10005 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i am very interested in the environment and in keeping it (%hesitation%) in the best conditions as possible
SI137O-00857-P10006 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 2.54 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we love thrifting
SI137O-00857-P10006 1 SI137O-00857 2.54 6.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and we also love going to get a little drink while we thrift
SI137O-00857-P10006 1 SI137O-00857 6.88 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's very fun because you can find the most amazing pieces ever and they're also unique
SI137O-00857-P10006 1 SI137O-00857 12.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we also love just sitting down just enjoying our time in a park just chatting and keeping up with everything
SI137O-00857-P10007 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 3.34 <o,Q4,B2,P1> look wise i think my little sister
SI137O-00857-P10007 1 SI137O-00857 3.34 4.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we look very similar
SI137O-00857-P10007 1 SI137O-00857 4.94 7.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> like some people really think that she's my daughter
SI137O-00857-P10007 1 SI137O-00857 7.74 13.64 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but personality wise i would say my other younger sister
SI137O-00857-P10007 1 SI137O-00857 13.64 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) yeah
SI137O-00857-P10008 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 6.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> actually would love to live in the u k for a couple of years and then come back home
SI137O-00857-P10008 1 SI137O-00857 6.49 9.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) yeah i truly love spain
SI137O-00857-P10008 1 SI137O-00857 9.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 3.58 <o,Q5,B2,P3> schools and (coll-) and colleges should make time in (s-)
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 3.58 5.90 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i would say yes
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 5.90 8.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i personally agree with that statement
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 8.71 23.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) i think the advantages is that of that is that if the students that have no time (%hesitation%) after school to do any (%hesitation%) type of sport they (ge-) get an opportunity finally be able to (%hesitation%) exercise throughout the day
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 23.59 28.05 <o,Q5,B2,P3> plus is also very good for (%hesitation%) students' health
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 28.05 41.44 <o,Q5,B2,P3> also the disadvantages (%hesitation%) i dunno i think that unless somebody has like a (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) some sort of physical difficulty that's the only disadvantage i see
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 41.44 43.85 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion i think that that's great
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 43.85 47.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that should be done more
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 47.66 49.39 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's it's perfect
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 49.39 58.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that there isn't anything wrong with it really except for any student who has any physical problems or disadvantages
SI137O-00857-P30017 1 SI137O-00857 58.78 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i know
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 4.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) this diagram shows how honey is produced
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 4.99 9.47 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the first step bees collect nectar from flowers that they find nearby
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 9.47 17.22 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) go to their beehives and they make honey from that nectar that they've gathered
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 17.22 24.08 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) after a while of gathering nectar and transforming it into honey beekeepers collect that honey
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 24.08 26.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they (%hesitation%) put it into jars
SI137O-00857-P40018 1 SI137O-00857 26.58 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then (%hesitation%) they ship it to supermarkets where it's (%hesitation%) sold to everyone to enjoy
SI137O-00857-P50019 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 6.23 <o,Q5,B2,P5> what they should consider is i'd say the cost of living
SI137O-00857-P50019 1 SI137O-00857 6.23 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because if they have enough money to (su-) to just to live without working they would have to find a place that's low key cheap so they don't have to work and study at same time
SI137O-00857-P50020 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 4.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) if you study in a second language you learn that language

SI137O-00857-P50020 1 SI137O-00857 12.70 13.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think it's easy enough
SI137O-00857-P50020 1 SI137O-00857 13.97 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> always done it
SI137O-00857-P50020 1 SI137O-00857 14.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so yeah
SI137O-00857-P50021 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 14.82 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think what they might find difficult might be the language if they don't speak it very (%hesitation%) fluently or maybe making friends or adapting to the country
SI137O-00857-P50021 1 SI137O-00857 14.82 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) yeah
SI137O-00857-P50022 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 13.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can learn it when they're (%hesitation%) going outside with friends to like clubs or if they just visit museums or historical sites or just a simple and nice restaurant where they serve local food
SI137O-00857-P50022 1 SI137O-00857 13.86 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's also a very great place where you can (%hesitation%) learn about the local culture
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857 0.00 7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's it's true because it gives you the freedom of doing whatever you like
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857 7.41 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and if you make mistakes there isn't really somebody from your family that could help you
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857 12.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you don't want to
SI137O-00859-P10005 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i am very interesting
SI137O-00859-P10006 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i spend my free time reading study english spanish (%hesitation%) planning travel around the the world
SI137O-00859-P10007 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P1> speak to another people with another people

SI137O-00859-P30017 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 21.64 <o,Q4,B1,P3> the (advanta-) advantage for study part time is you can work off the the day and can you have money and practise the you studied
SI137O-00859-P30017 1 SI137O-00859 21.64 41.67 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and disvantage is that you not finish yearly the the university but you can more time for study
SI137O-00859-P30017 1 SI137O-00859 41.67 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i agree and support this this option
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 6.18 <o,Q4,B1,P4> at first the factories produces more pollution
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 6.18 12.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this cause acid particles are in smoke
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 12.93 19.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and and this acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 19.51 27.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the wind get some (%hesitation%) articles fall as dust
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 27.38 31.95 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and anothers can mix cloud water

SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 47.38 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this damage to environment
SI137O-00859-P50019 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think the healthy living is a hard process but i can do this for discipline and share with others that i can do this too
SI137O-00859-P50020 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 11.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> water can help you to think more clarity and sleep more healthy too
SI137O-00859-P50020 1 SI137O-00859 11.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so drink water that can be hard but that's so important
SI137O-00859-P50021 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 2.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> oh it depends
SI137O-00859-P50021 1 SI137O-00859 2.73 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> depends the the situation but i think that so much import really really important doing exercises but not every day (%hesitation%)
SI137O-00859-P50022 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 14.61 <o,Q4,B1,P5> have a great quality of sleeping is most important but eight hours for a day that's hard
SI137O-00859-P50022 1 SI137O-00859 14.61 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think if we can sleep well
SI137O-00859-P50023 1 SI137O-00859 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P5> depends on uses but i think the technology in general mood that's more no helping people in in major cases

SI137O-00875-P30017 1 SI137O-00875 0.00 18.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well from my point of view i think there are some advantages (%hesitation%) to work as (%hesitation%) waiter for example while you are studying but i think that there are more disadvantages than advantages
SI137O-00875-P30017 1 SI137O-00875 18.34 32.03 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example if you are (%hesitation%) working you don't have much time from yourself and (%hesitation%) from your family or your pets even your friends
SI137O-00875-P30017 1 SI137O-00875 32.03 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so from my point of view i think that (%hesitation%) if you are working while you are (%hesitation%) studying it's a very difficult (%hesitation%) task but i think if you want to aim the money please do absolutely gain please

SI137O-00875-P40018 1 SI137O-00875 36.88 42.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> later you should pass the document control
SI137O-00875-P40018 1 SI137O-00875 42.12 49.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is the more difficult task in the airport because there are a lot of people

SI137O-00875-P50021 1 SI137O-00875 0.00 18.80 <o,Q4,B1,P5> to be honest i think that group in projects are not a good idea because if you don't have time to (%hesitation%) meet with another people you don't lose this opportunity

SI137O-00898-P10006 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 11.26 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i especially enjoy my free time going out with my friends because (%hesitation%) what i hate the most is (th-) the loneliness
SI137O-00898-P10006 1 SI137O-00898 11.26 16.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i cannot imagine my my last days of my life alone
SI137O-00898-P10006 1 SI137O-00898 16.98 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that's why i'm trying to improve my relationship with my (frie-)
SI137O-00898-P10007 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 6.54 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i said before i have to use my english in in my job time
SI137O-00898-P10007 1 SI137O-00898 6.54 17.17 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so that's the best way of improving my english is practicing at my projects because i have to work with people from different countries in europe
SI137O-00898-P10007 1 SI137O-00898 17.17 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i have to improve my english
SI137O-00898-P10008 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 16.26 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am sure that it would be learning chinese because (%hesitation%) when i have to to to look for data sheets of products (%hesitation%) that are sold in china maybe you have to contact chinese people
SI137O-00898-P10008 1 SI137O-00898 16.26 20.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and it's better to (s-) talk to them in a in her (%hesitation%)
SI137O-00898-P30017 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 24.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i am quite sure that students doing part time jobs while they are studying have more pros than cons because (%hesitation%) in a lifestyle we are we have to spend a lot of of our time on the lifetime working
SI137O-00898-P30017 1 SI137O-00898 24.92 32.19 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so it's better to understand how enterprises (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) work
SI137O-00898-P30017 1 SI137O-00898 32.19 34.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> when you are
SI137O-00898-P30017 1 SI137O-00898 34.31 52.47 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so on the other hand (%hesitation%) it's not a good idea to spend too much time in (%hesitation%) your job time because you need to prepare your exams and (%hesitation%) all your homeworks
SI137O-00898-P30017 1 SI137O-00898 52.47 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so according to my opinion it's better to be focus on your
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 2.28 <o,Q5,B2,P4> hello everybody
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 2.28 16.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'm here to talk about acid rain cycle that (%hesitation%) this cycle begins (%hesitation%) in factories and vehicles (%hesitation%) producing pollution when they are working
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 16.74 22.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so they are they they create smoke and this acid particles are inside this smoke
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 22.92 31.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that goes up unto the sky and creates (%hesitation%) some clouds mixed with water
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 31.27 57.54 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when wind they move this clouds to the forest or to the rural areas and (%hesitation%) this and and it starts raining that's particles that particles goes down with the water and they produce some damages to the environment specially trees and and water in inside the lakes
SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 57.54 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that's how acid rain
SI137O-00898-P50019 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i would tell them to create a good schedule for your meals specially (%hesitation%) when you when your day starts you have to eat good sugar (%hesitation%) and some fat because you you need energy for your daytime
SI137O-00898-P50020 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 14.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00898-P50020 1 SI137O-00898 14.38 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so that's why it's very very important to drink two liters of water every
SI137O-00898-P50021 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 14.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> according to my opinion i think we (sh-) we (everybo-) everybody should do exercise every day because (%hesitation%) the jobs right now nowadays are very boring
SI137O-00898-P50021 1 SI137O-00898 14.68 19.36 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we are stuck in the in our chairs and in front of computers
SI137O-00898-P50021 1 SI137O-00898 19.36 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we need
SI137O-00898-P50022 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 9.91 <o,Q5,C,P5> i disagree this opinion because (%hesitation%) i i think that not everybody needs the same amount of of (%hesitation%) sleep sleeping time
SI137O-00898-P50022 1 SI137O-00898 9.91 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> because for example i only need six hours seven hours to just stay good for my daytime and not eight hours as i need it
SI137O-00898-P50023 1 SI137O-00898 0.00 12.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> at the beginning of this technology area i think it's (%hesitation%) it has it had a negative (%hesitation%) perception of (%hesitation%) healthy habits
SI137O-00898-P50023 1 SI137O-00898 12.06 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> but right now using augmented reality or something like that you can use technology to keep on moving
SI137O-00904-P10005 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am extremely interested in lear learning about other countries
SI137O-00904-P10006 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) ok it depends (%hesitation%) time to time (%hesitation%) but oftentimes i (%hesitation%) spend my free time playing video games and playing cards and some other times i (%hesitation%) watch football on tv
SI137O-00904-P10007 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) well (%hesitation%) i think there are different ways to improve my english through watching videos (%hesitation%) through writing on websites and through daily reading
SI137O-00904-P10008 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> okay if i had the chance to learn a new skill i would go for (%hesitation%) learning (%hesitation%) cooking because i think it helps (m-) it helps me in different ways like in my real life and yeah
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 5.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> ok (%hesitation%) first of all let me talk about the advantages
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 5.57 25.59 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) when you when students do part time jobs they will have enough money they earn enough money for their studies and they can (%hesitation%) earn enough money for for (%hesitation%) you know for things that they they can buy and they will also get familiar with the responsibilities
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 25.59 31.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> (%hesitation%) they knows how to be a responsible person when when doing part time jobs
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 31.52 36.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> and this also prepares them for their life (%hesitation%) as well
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 36.16 40.77 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages for part time jobs as well
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 40.77 48.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all the students will not have enough time for their study and for their leisure time
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 48.56 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and (%hesitation%) personally i think part time (jo-) jobs are necessary since it prepares students for their life
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 12.87 <o,Q5,C,P4> ok talking about the diagram (%hesitation%) we can come to this conclusion that acid rain are (ex-) (existi-) (%hesitation%) exceedingly dangerous for the environment
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 12.87 18.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> and (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) (i-) (i-) it is (%hesitation%) because of the pollution
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 18.67 32.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example (%hesitation%) if you look at the diagram factories (%hesitation%) provides and they they (pro-) produce pollution which goes into the air and after that it is carried by winds to some parts
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 32.67 38.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in some parts it falls down to the (%hesitation%) to the (%hesitation%) rivers again
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 38.22 47.59 <o,Q5,C,P4> and (%hesitation%) the rest of it is carried to the (%hesitation%) (win-) to the clouds which (%hesitation%) eventually (%hesitation%) becomes water
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 47.59 51.21 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it rains into the environment or into the ground
SI137O-00904-P40018 1 SI137O-00904 51.21 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it damages the ground because it is polluted and it is not (%hesitation%) safe (%hesitation%) for the environment
SI137O-00904-P50019 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 6.35 <o,Q5,C,P5> okay i think (%hesitation%) they need to have a very healthy eating habits
SI137O-00904-P50019 1 SI137O-00904 6.35 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> like (%hesitation%) they need to include some vegetables fruits (%hesitation%) and some (%hesitation%) you know (%hesitation%) low fat (%hesitation%) food in their eating habits
SI137O-00904-P50020 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 8.62 <o,Q5,C,P5> okay naturally it's very important (%hesitation%) to drink water since it (%hesitation%) it has a lot of advantages
SI137O-00904-P50020 1 SI137O-00904 8.62 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) first of all it (%hesitation%) you know it it cleans your skin from some (%hesitation%) rubbish things and it does not provide the spots on your face
SI137O-00904-P50021 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes of course i think (%hesitation%) doing exercise every day is really really essential for (%hesitation%) everybody because (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it is particularly for those people who are are working all day and (d-) (%hesitation%) doing exercise to manage their (%hesitation%) stress and their
SI137O-00904-P50022 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 10.29 <o,Q5,C,P5> i (%hesitation%) profoundly agree with them because sleeping is (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) it is absolutely vital for every person
SI137O-00904-P50022 1 SI137O-00904 10.29 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) because if you if you do not sleep you will not have (%hesitation%) you will not be in the (s-) in the good mood during the day and you will feel very tired every single
SI137O-00904-P50023 1 SI137O-00904 0.00 4.08 <o,Q5,C,P5> (%hesitation%) i think (%hesitation%) it depends on the (pe-) (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) on people
SI137O-00904-P50023 1 SI137O-00904 4.08 9.82 <o,Q5,C,P5> some people use it in a negative way which has negative effects on them
SI137O-00904-P50023 1 SI137O-00904 9.82 20.00 <o,Q5,C,P5> however some people use it in a very positive way which has got positive impacts (%hesitation%) on their lifestyle
SI137O-00916-P10005 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 10.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is said that the environment is very important to take into account because of the fact that it has a lot of big problems such as the pollution nowadays
SI137O-00916-P10005 1 SI137O-00916 10.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i am very interested in this topic because i want to help our planet and (%hesitation%) doing things that (%hesitation%) could (%hesitation%) help other people (t-)
SI137O-00916-P10006 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 6.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is said that friends are a good (%hesitation%) and important (%hesitation%) part of your life
SI137O-00916-P10006 1 SI137O-00916 6.03 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so from my point of view it's very important for me and my friends because we when we are together we hang out and go to the beach or to the cinema and we help each other when we have (%hesitation%) some problems
SI137O-00916-P10007 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 13.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> although there are some people that say that i'm more i'm more similar to my mother i think that i'm more similar to my father because we like to (%hesitation%) do the (thi-) the same thing such as watch films or read books
SI137O-00916-P10007 1 SI137O-00916 13.75 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so if i were you i would (%hesitation%) think about it and know well the person of your family
SI137O-00916-P10008 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 14.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i have to choose i would choose to live in another country because it's important to me get experiences and (%hesitation%) know other cultures other languages of other places
SI137O-00916-P10008 1 SI137O-00916 14.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so (%hesitation%) if could i would (%hesitation%) live and job for example in london
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 6.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this is an interesting statement and is said to be very important (becau-) because we have to take into account
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 6.94 9.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it has both (%hesitation%) pros and cons
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 9.73 32.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the one hand the advantages could be that the students of schools and colleges (%hesitation%) should get or keep fit because of the fact that (%hesitation%) some scientific studies say that (%hesitation%) we (%hesitation%) must (%hesitation%) obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains (%hesitation%) is (%hesitation%) working during the day
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 32.04 42.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and we need (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) substances (%hesitation%) to (%hesitation%) make a good connection (%hesitation%) between the brain and our body
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 42.06 52.56 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the oh and on the other hand the disadvantages could be that (%hesitation%) the students (%hesitation%) have (%hesitation%) less time to study their (%hesitation%) their units
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 52.56 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so (%hesitation%) to sum up (%hesitation%) in my opinion it's important to have time for all these type of activities
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 5.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> if you want to know how honey comes from flower and go to the shop i'm going to explain it
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 5.58 9.15 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all bees collect (%hesitation%) nectar from flowers
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 9.15 12.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> and bees (%hesitation%) make honey from nectar in beehives
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 12.13 21.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal in the planet (%hesitation%) because without them the planet could die
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 21.55 33.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> (%hesitation%) secondly the beekeepers collected the honey from beehives due to (%hesitation%) no in order to (%hesitation%) taking to a recipient that is called jars
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 33.75 50.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> by the end of the process (%hesitation%) they (%hesitation%) will have (%hesitation%) taken (%hesitation%) into (%hesitation%) a car (%hesitation%) where a person (%hesitation%) transport these type of recipient (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) to a supermarket a shop
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 50.02 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P4> and there the people (%hesitation%) could buy this honey and take (%hesitation%) this (%hesitation%) food to their homes
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if i were them i would choose (%hesitation%) a country where (th-) (%hesitation%) where i could (%hesitation%) speak the language for example u s a or london (%hesitation%) something like that because i could communicate with other people and it's easier to me
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916 14.61 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and other country where the meteorology is (%hesitation%) similar like the country where they came from
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 7.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all (%hesitation%) the (a-) the advantage of study (%hesitation%) a second language is that you can communicate with other (pe-) (%hesitation%) with other people
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916 7.88 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you can travel to more countries because you (%hesitation%) know another (%hesitation%) language and you have (%hesitation%) and you can (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) understand what other persons say to you
SI137O-00916-P50021 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the difficulty of studying in another country from my point of view is that you don't have your family near so if you (%hesitation%) want (%hesitation%) them near or you (%hesitation%) need them you only (%hesitation%) could (%hesitation%) call them with your mobile phone or something like that
SI137O-00916-P50021 1 SI137O-00916 14.84 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so if i were you i would spend (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) a few time (ou-)
SI137O-00916-P50022 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 8.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you study in another country (%hesitation%) you must go outside and learn about the culture (%hesitation%) by (%hesitation%) different ways
SI137O-00916-P50022 1 SI137O-00916 8.94 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example in order to (%hesitation%) know these (%hesitation%) culture this type of culture you could (%hesitation%) visit monuments or church or (%hesitation%) festivities
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916 0.00 7.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because of the fact that you are outside (%hesitation%) from my point of view you become more independent because you have to do all by yourself
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916 7.25 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain (%hesitation%) it (%hesitation%) alone
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916 15.72 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this is the reason why you become more independent

SI137O-00922-P10006 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 10.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm inclined to reading novels which can step which can allow me step into the fantastic world that the books provides
SI137O-00922-P10006 1 SI137O-00922 10.78 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so when i have free time i like to reading novels which also can provide me a sense of comfort and relaxed
SI137O-00922-P10007 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 6.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like to spend time with my husband because we share the same interests
SI137O-00922-P10007 1 SI137O-00922 6.73 10.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example we like to watch movies
SI137O-00922-P10007 1 SI137O-00922 10.07 15.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) whenever we watch movie which can also make us feel relaxed
SI137O-00922-P10007 1 SI137O-00922 15.88 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i like to spend leisure time with my husband
SI137O-00922-P10008 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 5.66 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to be the teacher because i think teacher is a meaningful job
SI137O-00922-P10008 1 SI137O-00922 5.66 9.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> just a single word can transform the person's life
SI137O-00922-P10008 1 SI137O-00922 9.43 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if possible i expect myself could be the formal teacher in senior high school
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 11.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think the advantages that (us-) university students they can get job to pay their intuitions (%hesitation%) here are two reasons for good
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 11.92 24.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> the first one is they can learn how to manage manage their time because once they have part time jobs they have to take some time to have part time job rather than study
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 24.89 28.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> so they have to control their time very well
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 28.12 35.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> besides i think (%hesitation%) (peop-) (%hesitation%) students will learn take responsibility for their academic performance
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 35.56 50.38 <o,Q5,C,P3> in order to (%hesitation%) pass their academic performance they should learn how to strike the balance between having a part time job and (%hesitation%) having the academic performance at the same time
SI137O-00922-P30017 1 SI137O-00922 50.38 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> so when it comes to the disadvantages i think (%hesitation%) because of the limited of time so the students should

SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 6.42 12.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i want to introduce you the stage that people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 12.34 14.46 <o,Q5,B2,P4> here are some stages
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 14.46 21.73 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first of all you will pick up which public transportation and to go travel to the airport
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 21.73 30.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> once you arrive at the airports then you will delivery your passport and your i d to check in
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 30.65 37.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then after that your own documents will deliver to a document control
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 37.23 41.35 <o,Q5,B2,P4> at this place the police will check out your document
SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 41.35 45.42 <o,Q5,B2,P4> everything whether they are proof will not be prove

SI137O-00922-P40018 1 SI137O-00922 55.24 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so if you can pass the security parts then you just need
SI137O-00922-P50019 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 7.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> if students want to use technoledge to study more effectively here comes some ways
SI137O-00922-P50019 1 SI137O-00922 7.78 15.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the first of all they can use chat g b t to help them to revise their writing essays
SI137O-00922-P50019 1 SI137O-00922 15.09 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> then after that they can know how to revise their (essa-)
SI137O-00922-P50020 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 6.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think if possible people students should learn face to face from the teachers
SI137O-00922-P50020 1 SI137O-00922 6.68 8.97 <o,Q5,B2,P5> (%hesitation%) here come some reasons
SI137O-00922-P50020 1 SI137O-00922 8.97 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first one because from face to face the students can identify the facial expressions and to get to know what the real what the (tea-)
SI137O-00922-P50021 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 7.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think if students can work by group project they can learn the communicating skills
SI137O-00922-P50021 1 SI137O-00922 7.94 16.51 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in order to achieve the same goal they should learn how to compromise and the (commu-) (co-) communicate with their group members
SI137O-00922-P50021 1 SI137O-00922 16.51 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> besides they have to learn how to
SI137O-00922-P50022 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 16.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i think attending lectures can learn more ideas than reading alone because in during this process the provider or the (present-) presenter they can provide the structure how ideas
SI137O-00922-P50022 1 SI137O-00922 16.66 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the audience can get the ideas from
SI137O-00922-P50023 1 SI137O-00922 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in order to make the students have advanced learning i think the learning facilities are quite important because in this way students just can use the abandon resources to explore their project or explore their academic (perform-)

SI137O-00931-P10006 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 11.75 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as most of my holidays (%hesitation%) will be on (%hesitation%) in summer i really like swimming (%hesitation%) because it's i think a really enjoyable way to spend my time
SI137O-00931-P10006 1 SI137O-00931 11.75 12.99 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) you know
SI137O-00931-P10006 1 SI137O-00931 12.99 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> (%hesitation%) swimming has already been enjoyable (%hesitation%) so i like doing it
SI137O-00931-P10007 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 12.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think i would say my mom (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) all (m-) most of our opinions are in same agreement (%hesitation%) which is why i really like talking to her her
SI137O-00931-P10007 1 SI137O-00931 12.34 15.67 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i can ask any questions i need
SI137O-00931-P10007 1 SI137O-00931 15.67 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and she can have information about it
SI137O-00931-P10008 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 8.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to be a businessman as it's been my ambition since my childhood to start a business
SI137O-00931-P10008 1 SI137O-00931 8.07 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> yeah
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 10.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's argued by many people that (%hesitation%) all students should get occupations to pay for their university studies on their own
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 10.55 28.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) it has several advantages main of them is that (%hesitation%) they have they get the experience of working in a workplace (%hesitation%) and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask money for their parents
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 28.72 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> (%hesitation%) the but (disad-) the the the the the (%hesitation%) jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies (%hesitation%) which is why i think (%hesitation%) they it's better for them to get jobs after their after finishing their degree
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> people who want to (%hesitation%) travel by aeroplane (%hesitation%) need to go through some (se-) (%hesitation%) several stages
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 8.20 14.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they are (%hesitation%) first of all (%hesitation%) they obviously need to travel to airport
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 14.88 18.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) and then they go to check in
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 18.89 27.85 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after their documents will be checkeds (%hesitation%) and following this they go to security
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 27.85 33.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and once they pass (%hesitation%) they go to the waiting room
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 33.02 42.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> (%hesitation%) (i-) in that room they can (%hesitation%) have meals (o-) have meals or (%hesitation%) go to toilet or something
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 42.92 60.00 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they finally go on board to get ready for the flight
SI137O-00931-P50019 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 15.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think with technologies (stu-) studying can be (%hesitation%) extremely (eff-) effective because (%hesitation%) students can reach unlimited source of information with one (%hesitation%) typing what they need
SI137O-00931-P50019 1 SI137O-00931 15.71 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think technology has good impact on studying
SI137O-00931-P50020 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying (%hesitation%) because (%hesitation%) the students who are face to face (%hesitation%) studying are will be under supervision (%hesitation%) (unle-) (s-) some (pe-) because some not every student are able to study without supervision
SI137O-00931-P50021 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think working on group projects can help students develop some of their skills (%hesitation%) for example communication skills (%hesitation%) can be a bright example because (%hesitation%) as they're working together there it's (inevi-) it's inevitable that their communication skills develop and so on
SI137O-00931-P50022 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no i don't think so because as (sat-) (%hesitation%) attending lectures (h-) have always seemed boring to students (%hesitation%) so i think (%hesitation%) reading alone can be much more effective way of studying
SI137O-00931-P50023 1 SI137O-00931 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because (%hesitation%) if they are not up up to date (%hesitation%) it can have bad (eff-) impact on their students' productivity
SI137O-00976-P10005 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 5.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i'm pretty interested in learning other countries coz i'm i like travelling
SI137O-00976-P10005 1 SI137O-00976 5.35 18.98 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think to learn other countries gives me a better learning about other countries' culture and i'd like to travelling and see other scenery and like to make friends from all over the world
SI137O-00976-P10005 1 SI137O-00976 18.98 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think that's
SI137O-00976-P10006 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 10.55 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well if it doesn't rain outside i'd like to get a lo (%hesitation%) i'd like to take a walk near the riverbank or just (%hesitation%) have a walk dog
SI137O-00976-P10006 1 SI137O-00976 10.55 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> but if it's rain i just like to stay at home and watch movies or animes and do something that i like and spend time with my father than
SI137O-00976-P10007 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i guess it must be speaking coz you know learning a foreign language and stuff the most important part is to speaking coz while you are speaking you can you may have some mistakes and (%hesitation%) the po process of solving the mistakes what helps you to improve yourself a lot
SI137O-00976-P10008 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i suppose it might be to learn the how to play the piano coz i've already know how to play the violin and i really love and i really love music
SI137O-00976-P10008 1 SI137O-00976 11.36 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i think play piano is very you know very graceful and i think that must be a wonderful thing
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 4.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> first i'd like to explain the advantages
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 4.15 11.44 <o,Q5,C,P3> as we all know that (%hesitation%) do part time jobs will give us more experience to work in the society
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 11.44 18.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you know the university students they are nearly to (%hesitation%) be a social society member
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 18.30 25.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> and that will give them some money and give them more ways to get the money to pay for their life
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 25.75 47.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> but there are also some disadvantages coz (%hesitation%) that me that might be a very distraction things and maybe the students can be cheating the (%hesitation%) social while they are doing the part time jobs coz they're still students and they don't have (%hesitation%) much (%hesitation%) rich social life experience
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 47.89 60.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion that's a great thing for the students to do part time jobs coz i think we can make more friends while we're doing the part time jobs and we can earn more money to
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 12.29 <o,Q5,B2,P4> for the pollutions turn into the acid rain and finally damage to the environment there are six steps in their ret turning
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 12.29 21.76 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first the factories and the vehicles may have much pollution and they will get the (as-) acid particles are in smoke
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 21.76 28.91 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and while the wind the wind has come and the acid particles are carried by the wind
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 28.91 36.31 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then some of them fall and as dust and they will dirty the lake or the soil
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 36.31 44.23 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles mix with cloud and water which will just turn into rain or snow
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 44.23 57.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and but in the end they also (%hesitation%) may (%hesitation%) turn into the fall into as dust and they will damage the trees the soil the land or the lake
SI137O-00976-P40018 1 SI137O-00976 57.24 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and in the end they will damage the
SI137O-00976-P50019 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 10.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> first of all we need to eating regularly and we need to avoid to eat more junk food like hamburgers or (%hesitation%) eat more sugar or oil
SI137O-00976-P50019 1 SI137O-00976 10.20 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING

SI137O-00976-P50020 1 SI137O-00976 12.38 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) for example after we have (%hesitation%) exercise it can increase our physical water
SI137O-00976-P50021 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that depends coz (a-) coz we're not the professional (%hesitation%) sporters so i think (%hesitation%) doing the exercise regularly and (%hesitation%) is very important because that will keep us (%hesitation%) better shape and make us healthy in both physically and mentally i think
SI137O-00976-P50022 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 9.29 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that depends you know coz (%hesitation%) you know the quality of our sleeping is the is the most important thing
SI137O-00976-P50022 1 SI137O-00976 9.29 14.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think is important to have a great sleep environment instead of the time we sleep
SI137O-00976-P50022 1 SI137O-00976 14.87 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and (%hesitation%) i think eight hours' sleep is is also a great thing i think
SI137O-00976-P50023 1 SI137O-00976 0.00 16.83 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think generally (s-) generally speak i think it's better it's bigger than it negative coz i think (%hesitation%) while we're (j-) (%hesitation%) nowadays we go to the hospital and we just take some c t or other science equipment to (%hesitation%) test our body cells
SI137O-00976-P50023 1 SI137O-00976 16.83 18.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and that's very convenient
SI137O-00976-P50023 1 SI137O-00976 18.32 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they are very directly
SI137O-00980-P10005 1 SI137O-00980 0.00 1.82 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love the summer

SI137O-00980-P10005 1 SI137O-00980 9.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and in the summer it's more easier to look the the sea and going to the to the to the sea
SI137O-00980-P10006 1 SI137O-00980 0.00 12.16 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's very important for because in my job i must know about the the last news

SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 10.48 13.58 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so the first have a pollution
SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 13.58 22.36 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the pollution have a acido particles are in the smoke
SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 22.36 32.84 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and after acid particles are in the carried by winds and have a two parts
SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 32.84 44.08 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the (f-) the some acid particles fall as dust and the other acido particles mix with the clouds water
SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 44.08 49.52 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after this the acido particles are in the rain or snow
SI137O-01125-P40018 1 SI137O-01125 49.52 57.19 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so is this danger because the acido rain is dangerous for the peoples

SI137O-01125-P50020 1 SI137O-01125 0.00 14.13 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think for drink water you have buy one bottle for you and you put a water in your bottle and drink all day

SI137O-01125-P50021 1 SI137O-01125 15.49 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i think that's it
