SI114J-00031-P10005 1 SI114J-00031  0.00  4.65 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm very interested in music
SI114J-00031-P10005 1 SI114J-00031  4.65 15.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i love music and i like to listen to music of all kinds
SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031  0.00  3.02 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i love to travel
SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031  3.02 11.89 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i travel to paris to rome to madrid to barcelona
SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031 11.89 15.34 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in summary i enjoy travelling
SI114J-00031-P10008 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 14.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think that speaking english will help me to give a physical education class in a college in the future
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 20.81 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one advantage could be that you will learn a foreign language and you can speak this language in the country where people speak this language
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031 20.81 33.17 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one disadvantage could be that if you don't need a foreign language in the future you have this obligation
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031 33.17 57.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion you shouldn't pay for the exam to pass the university course if you don't need a foreign language because it costs a lot
SI114J-00031-P50020 1 SI114J-00031  0.00  2.51 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i agree
SI114J-00031-P50020 1 SI114J-00031  2.51 16.53 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the newspapers will disappear because on the internet you can read the news without paying anything
SI114J-00031-P50021 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 18.92 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion the social media will never be reliable because on it you can write what you think and many people invent many things
SI114J-00031-P50022 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 18.75 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that it's very important to keep up with the local news because this way you can avoid many things for example the traffic in the city
SI114J-00031-P50023 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that in the media there is a lot of bad news but this news serves to sell and to attract many people to spend money
SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  1.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot

SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077  6.12 11.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> this channel is focused on electronic dance music or e d m
SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077 11.39 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think it's very important for that to be recognised in society because there are so many tracks and artists
SI114J-00077-P10006 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  5.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot because for me it's very important to discover new places

SI114J-00077-P10007 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  5.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say rafael nadal who is a tennis player and a spanish player

SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  9.28 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my case i'm finishing my degree it's about how to be i mean how to administrate a business
SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077  9.28 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i would say that a lot because in the future probably i would need it for talking to people from wales or for doing some business in england
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  6.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion the best way is going on the internet and searching for the news that they are interested in
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077  6.75 18.55 <o,Q3,C,P5> they should take a look at media like for example b b c or c n n so they have like a regular perspective of what is happening around the world

SI114J-00077-P50020 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 16.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> i have to disagree with this assumption because for example in emerging countries like brazil or indonesia they will need newspapers because they don't have access to the internet in all areas

SI114J-00077-P50022 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 12.64 <o,Q3,C,P5> local news is essential for bringing the community together because thanks to it we know what's happening in our town or in our village for example
SI114J-00077-P50022 1 SI114J-00077 12.64 19.86 <o,Q3,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 14.17 <o,Q3,C,P5> i think that that is true because there is a lot of bad news around the world and also with the coronavirus pandemic we see like more of it
SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077 14.17 19.86 <o,Q3,C,P5> so i think that the important thing for the news is to inform
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 14.18 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's a very quiet and residential neighbourhood but like five hundred meters away from here we have a very beautiful forest with a lot of animals
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 14.18 15.58 <o,Q4,C,P1> we have a river
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 15.58 19.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> so during the weekends i usually go there
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  1.76 <o,Q4,C,P1> it depends
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  1.76  6.48 <o,Q4,C,P1> for example during summer holidays i love to travel
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  6.48 11.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> i usually go to warm places with my friends

SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  3.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> right now it is not very clear for me
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  3.85  9.07 <o,Q4,C,P1> i know i would love to do something related with business
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  9.07 19.84 <o,Q4,C,P1> but the thing that i have clearest is that i wanna have a job that requires me to travel a lot and to be in a lot of cities
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 21.57 <o,Q4,C,P3> so on the one hand we have the advantages of getting a job to pay for the university studies which are that you free your parents of the responsibility of paying and you get more experience even though it is something that is not related to your degree
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 21.57 26.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you may have additional income for the weekends or for holidays
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 26.99 36.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand you cannot live the university lifestyle properly
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 36.00 47.60 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also you may be a little bit more stressed because of the subjects at university because you don't have as much time as your peers
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 47.60 59.66 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion it is very useful and very important to have a job but maybe a part time job and not a full time one
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> ok so today's presentation is about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088  5.34 13.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> as you all know the airplane is one of the few means of transport that we have right now
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 13.14 16.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> so first of all we'll have to go to the airport
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 16.16 19.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> that is the place where the flights leave from
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 19.34 24.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> so once we get there we will have to check in
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 24.22 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> that means giving some people that work for the company we are flying with our information so they will give us our tickets
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 32.97 35.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> and we can give them our luggage
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 35.57 41.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> then we'll go through the document control and after that the security
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 41.38 49.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> they will check everything that we have in our luggage and that we have the visas to go to our destination
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 49.97 53.11 <o,Q4,C,P4> we'll have to wait a little bit until we board
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 53.11 56.96 <o,Q4,C,P4> the boarding time is thirty minutes before the flight
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 56.96 58.29 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then leave
SI114J-00088-P50019 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 19.97 <o,Q4,C,P5> so for example technology could be very useful when doing your research for example because instead of having to use an encylopedia you can use other websites that you can find that go into more detail about those subjects
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> i really think so because if you are face to face with your teacher you have to pay attention to him and you will be more able to understand what he's saying and to ask questions at the time
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088 15.25 19.93 <o,Q4,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 10.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's very important working in groups because in the future you'll need to work in groups with other workmates
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 10.64 15.74 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i don't know like a lot of the skills that are developed while working in groups
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 15.74 19.93 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think like the most important ones are soft skills
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.79 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course and it is the same reasoning as with the face to face classes
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088  5.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> because if you have any questions while you are there you can obviously ask at the time or i dunno after class

SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.35 <o,Q4,C,P5> even though i think it's important i don't think it's the most important thing
SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088  5.35 13.45 <o,Q4,C,P5> i mean you obviously gotta have like a library some computers in order to let people do research

SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  9.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well to know about other countries for me is always very exciting and very nice
SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123  9.09 13.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i am very excited to know about other countries
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  9.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i can i like to go away to the countryside with some friends some family and have fun times
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123  9.62 15.85 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if it's possible have some barbecues with them and just have fun
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  6.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my english i think the best way is to learn and to practice and practice and practice again
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123  6.23 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so to improve my english i will watch more documentaries or t v programmes or read more books in english
SI114J-00123-P10008 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 16.53 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to learn to fly drones because it's something that maybe could help me in my work to take some photos from the air of some buildings or some spaces
SI114J-00123-P50019 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> okay so i will suggest to them to organise their meals because to have good times for them is important and to have them regularly in your days is important for good eating habits
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 16.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that drinking water is always important not just to have a healthy lifestyle or to be healthy because you have to drink two liters of water per day if you can
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123 16.88 18.92 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's the recommendation
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 11.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course it's essential to feel good in yourself and to be healthy you have to do exercise for the time that you need
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123 11.59 19.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> you don't have to do it every day for five hours but for a short time yes
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  3.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that it's not essential to sleep eight hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123  3.79 11.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can be productive and you can be healthy just sleeping six or seven hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123 11.06 17.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> you have to find the number of hours you need for your body
SI114J-00123-P50023 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think both because you can use the technology to be more healthy with some activities or application advice or in other cases you can use it for bad unhealthy routines
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132  0.00  3.97 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i'm really interested in the environment
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132  3.97  7.21 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that we must respect it

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132  0.00 11.50 <o,Q3,B2,P3> doing fitness classes is really important to everybody because it has a lot of advantages
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 11.50 33.67 <o,Q3,B2,P3> some of them are that you are going to have a healthy life and you're going to learn to organise your time during the day because you don't only have to study you also need to have time to do other things
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 33.67 38.76 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so fitness classes can be like a hobby

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 47.88 56.55 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but if you really want do fitness classes it is going to be good for you
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 56.55 59.19 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion it is necessary
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132  0.00  8.93 <o,Q3,B2,P4> honey is a really natural food that you can eat with your breakfast for example
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132  8.93 12.61 <o,Q3,B2,P4> and it is really healthy

SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 12.65 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think he has the wisdom to give me advice for my life my professional life and also personal life
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  9.99 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it will help me a lot mostly in my professional life as i'm going to work in an international company
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269  9.99 15.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i will need to communicate in english with all my colleagues throughout the world
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269 15.70 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and also personally it will help me a lot when travelling i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  4.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> well of course i think it's extremely important to learn a foreign language
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269  4.88 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all speaking two languages really opens your mind i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 10.71 23.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> it opens your mind not only to a new language but also to a whole new culture because most of the time you don't only learn a new language you also learn about the history of the country of the language you are learning
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 23.62 35.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if it's spain you're gonna learn about the latin american region also about the history of spain portugal et cetera
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 35.62 37.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's extremely important
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 37.47 40.01 <o,Q5,C,P3> and then i think it depends on where you're from
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 40.01 56.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> because if you are already from america or england and you are a native english speaker i think it's a little bit less important than for example if you're from another country and you don't speak english since english is the predominant language in our modern society

SI114J-00269-P50019 1 SI114J-00269  0.00 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the best way it is to actually follow the media in your country which already select and collect and give you a summary of the news around the world

SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269  3.06 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think we will lose the paper newspapers and i think it would be more technology driven digital driven
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 10.59 18.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think web platforms will always exist from now on and yeah newspapers will just take a different form
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 18.27 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> they will be more on the internet

SI114J-00269-P50021 1 SI114J-00269  4.46 19.43 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's that you see generally ninety percent of actual facts and then there are ten percent where you have to check the sources to make sure it's a reliable source et cetera
SI114J-00269-P50022 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  3.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think it's so important to follow the local news to be honest

SI114J-00269-P50022 1 SI114J-00269  7.81 14.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's good to know yeah it's always good to know what's going on around the world the state of the world

SI114J-00283-P10007 1 SI114J-00283 15.10 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i want to improve then i must get more and more practice in them

SI114J-00283-P10008 1 SI114J-00283  8.31 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> it should include software like java and other types because they will be very important for me in future so i want to learn them all

SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 13.25 17.52 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are pros and cons to this

SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 29.07 38.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> if the university students do part time jobs along with their studies then they will be able to pay their tuition fees and also the university fees
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 38.87 44.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> and secondly they will be more independent of their family
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 44.23 56.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages to this because it takes time to do a part time job and they will be unable to give more time to their studies

SI114J-00298-P30017 1 SI114J-00298  0.00 10.42 <o,Q3,B2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they have more advantages

SI114J-00316-P40018 1 SI114J-00316 24.45 26.90 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to check in

SI114J-00316-P50021 1 SI114J-00316 10.26 14.17 <o,Q5,C,P5> and you need patience and to learn to work as a group

SI114J-00326-P50022 1 SI114J-00326  0.00 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> attending lectures helps us to gain other knowledge aside from the knowledge we study at school and also helps us to know like how to make a speech

SI114J-00517-P50019 1 SI114J-00517  0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that the best way is to search the internet for international news because it's a good tool that you can use and have information in just seconds
SI114J-00517-P50019 1 SI114J-00517 14.84 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so yes that will be the best way

SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 23.33 28.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it could be useful in their job in the future
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 28.29 34.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> about the disadvantages i don't think there are really any disadvantages
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 34.76 48.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> perhaps in their final courses they won't have enough time because they'll have a lot of material from their own course but it's not really a disadvantage
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 48.49 57.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion the more languages you know the better it would be for you

SI114J-00579-P50019 1 SI114J-00579  8.57 14.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for them it's very easy to use the technology

SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579  3.53  8.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> every day we use more and more technology
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579  8.05 13.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we have to reduce our paper consumption
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 13.41 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i suppose we'll search for the news on the internet
SI114J-00579-P50021 1 SI114J-00579  0.00  6.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion social media are not a reliable source of news

SI114J-00579-P50022 1 SI114J-00579  0.00  7.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think to keep up to date with local news is very important
SI114J-00579-P50022 1 SI114J-00579  7.36 11.52 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i find for my work it is necessary

SI114J-00579-P50023 1 SI114J-00579  0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in one way i guess it is important to know the bad news to know what is happening in the world

SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591  0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i can see that one of the advantages of having a job to pay for your university fees could be that it feels like i don't know like an achievement
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 14.76 20.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think that the disadvantages are far more important
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 20.45 33.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> like if you spend most of the time working at a job it is difficult for you to really get good studying time
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 33.49 44.26 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that university students have to work to pay for their studies
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 44.26 57.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand it should be the government who provides scholarships for everyone to go to university if they really want to do so
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first thing you need to do is to get to the airport
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591  7.03 14.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so for this you could choose your own vehicle or just get one of the forms of public transport that your city provides
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 14.29 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it could be buses or the metro
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 17.66 22.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you get into the airport you should check in first
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 22.14 32.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you will have to show your i d information your i d document to the security people
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 32.97 43.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> also you will need to show your luggage in order for the security people to check that there's no weapon inside
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 43.91 48.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just need to wait for your plane to leave
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 48.34 53.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the moment of getting onto the plane is very easy
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 53.70 57.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you just need to follow the arrows and then you will be ready to fly
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> the main way to use technology for studying is to use it to get information

SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591  0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i believe face to face learning with a teacher it's the best way i think to create some confidence between the lecturer and the pupils
SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591 10.61 19.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> and for the students to be confident about resolving doubts asking questions and maybe getting more information
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.82 <o,Q4,C,P5> group projects provide students with the opportunity to work in collaboration with other people
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591  7.82 19.26 <o,Q4,C,P5> and the most important thing of this i think it is that they can learn how to improve their work with the opinion of their colleagues
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> attending lectures is more effective than reading alone only when the lecturer is a good one
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591  7.63 11.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> but sadly this is not always the situation
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591 11.04 19.26 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i think this question just depends on what the lecturer's skills are in education

SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 12.63 24.40 <o,Q4,C,P4> with the development of modern industries factories and vehicles produce pollution in the form of smoke which has acid particles in it

SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 52.59 59.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> and eventually it will do damage to the environment

SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734  0.00 11.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of the advantages is that doing exercise is very important for our health
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 11.21 25.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if the students do exercise during the day in school they don't have to do it when they are out of school and have time to do their homework

SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 10.44 18.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it is a very natural process where the bees make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 18.89 38.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they have to be calm and quiet because if they feel some danger around them it could be dangerous for the beekeepers that are collecting honey from beehives

SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 15.96 35.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when this pollution or polluted air comes out of the vehicles and factories those acid particles fly into the air as smoke fly into the air and are carried by wind and they get mixed up with clouds
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 35.24 42.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and in those clouds the acid is mixed with some cloud water
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 42.33 52.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when the acid is mixed with the cloud water acid particles are then in rain or the snow
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 52.00 59.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when it rains it will damage the environment and the trees

SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797  8.38 17.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first you have to travel to the airport which can be in different means of transport
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 17.54 25.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> once in the airport you have to check in and pass a document control
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 25.05 34.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the airport authorities have to carry out a security check on your baggage
SI114J-00797-P40018 1 SI114J-00797 34.91 49.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> once you've passed this you have to wait until the time to board the plane

SI1267-00010-P10005 1 SI1267-00010  5.29 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example my favourite singers are snoop dogg and fifty cent and i love listening to them coz i feel like i am in a different country
SI1267-00010-P10006 1 SI1267-00010  0.00 12.76 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love going to different places because it can be really fun if you go and if you're visiting with a couple of friends or with family
SI1267-00010-P10006 1 SI1267-00010 12.76 18.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can learn a lot about different cultures and gain new knowledge

SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010  6.30 11.92 <o,Q3,C,P3> for example the students make friends from different countries which is a very good point
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 11.92 15.88 <o,Q3,C,P3> besides they could work in a better place
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 15.88 26.85 <o,Q3,C,P3> for example if they live in china they could travel to the u k and london to earn more money
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 26.85 36.20 <o,Q3,C,P3> and finally it encourages them to learn another language if they didn't want to in the past
SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010 36.20 43.31 <o,Q3,C,P3> it could be a very bad idea because it could stress them if they are not good at the language

SI1267-00010-P50019 1 SI1267-00010  0.00  9.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to begin with international news can be a very good way to know something about other places and countries

SI1267-00037-P50021 1 SI1267-00037  0.00  6.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it totally depends on which kind of social media you choose

SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060  0.00  5.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think there are two ways to improve my english
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060  5.42 12.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> first is to make conversation with foreigners
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060 12.25 19.67 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and on the other hand i want to travel around to chat with the local people
SI1267-00104-P10007 1 SI1267-00104  0.00 10.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is speaking it a lot and also seeing series films or listening to the radio in english
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  6.15 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would love to have the skill to learn different languages without trouble
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104  6.15 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as i said before i love different cultures which involve languages and for me it would be an amazing skill
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  7.38 <o,Q4,C,P3> as we all know doing part time jobs while you are studying has some disadvantages but also some advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104  7.38 10.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> i would like to start with the advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 10.14 20.06 <o,Q4,C,P3> okay so if you think about doing part time jobs while you are studying the first thing that comes to your mind is that you are going to start to experience life like an adult
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 20.06 30.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> you're going to leave behind your teenage years and start making money saving money and also be busier during the day
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 30.90 33.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 33.58 41.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> you are going to have less time to be with your friends practicing some sport or maybe things like that
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 41.42 43.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> also studying
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 43.64 54.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i would love to do a part time job when studying because that way i would spend my own money on everything that i wanted
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104  0.00 10.44 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course a person can stay awake without sleeping more than eight hours but it badly affects their health
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104 10.44 16.19 <o,Q4,C,P5> we should sleep eight or more than eight hours every day
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  9.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> from my point of view technology has affected our mental health in a good way but our physical health in a bad way
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104  9.95 18.58 <o,Q4,C,P5> because when we are on our mobile phone we adopt some strange postures we don't sleep as much as we need to we don't do exercise
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  4.11 <o,Q4,X,P1> i really enjoy travelling to different places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  4.11  7.12 <o,Q4,X,P1> it's good to know a lot of places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  7.12 17.73 <o,Q4,X,P1> i enjoy more natural places where i can go with my dog and green areas you know something like that
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  2.97 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't know
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  2.97  5.39 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't like famous people
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  5.39 12.82 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't watch that kind of news
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 12.82 19.26 <o,Q4,X,P1> and i don't get impressed by any famous people
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,X,P1> in my view english is the language of the future that everybody will need to know
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105  8.20 14.21 <o,Q4,X,P1> so to communicate with anyone around the world you'll need english
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105 14.21 19.77 <o,Q4,X,P1> so i think it will be very useful for me and for everyone
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105  0.00 16.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> to get started i'm gonna put forward the pros and cons about studying at least one foreign language and about it being necessary for the students to pass the university course
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 16.07 32.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the positive side it will help the students themselves to broaden their minds and to improve their knowledge of the world
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 32.29 51.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand wasting time trying to learn another language could well lead the students to give up their university course earlier
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  8.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to find out about international news is on the internet
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105  8.60 17.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's to get informed at the moment that things happen anywhere in the world
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  5.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i partially agree because there are people who like to read the newspaper in paper form
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105  5.16 11.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it's true that we have to take into account the environment
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105 11.06 18.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's better to stop printing a newspaper that you can see online
SI1267-00105-P50021 1 SI1267-00105  0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i truly believe that social media is not a reliable source of news because there are some people who try to spread fake news

SI1267-00105-P50023 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  6.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> maybe it's true that there is too much bad news in the media

SI1267-00115-P10008 1 SI1267-00115  8.43 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so and through this profession i am going to serve the country and the people
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115  0.00  7.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think doing a job before graduation is always good for a student
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115  7.47 12.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it enhances their knowledge and their experience

SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 25.59 32.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but it shouldn't be mandatory to pay for their university studies
SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115 32.95 35.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it should be optional

SI1267-00146-P40018 1 SI1267-00146 10.16 20.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then bees produce honey with the nectar and pollen in beehives

SI1267-00146-P50020 1 SI1267-00146  0.00 18.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the main benefit of studying a foreign language is to learn something new about a different culture and to communicate with different people as well
SI1267-00146-P50021 1 SI1267-00146  0.00 17.25 <o,Q5,C,P5> they might have trouble when they want to communicate with the local people because they are students and maybe their language is not clear for the local people

SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482  0.00 11.42 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantage is the student can know the new language which is spoken in the world

SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 23.75 35.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> my opinion is students have to study one or more foreign languages in their university course
SI1267-00482-P30017 1 SI1267-00482 35.38 48.10 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's because the students will get skills in the foreign language

SI1267-00482-P50021 1 SI1267-00482  3.34  8.32 <o,Q4,B2,P5> social media focuses on the spread of information
SI1267-00482-P50021 1 SI1267-00482  8.32 17.73 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it's not always great information to spread
SI1267-00482-P50023 1 SI1267-00482  0.00  2.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think so too
SI1267-00482-P50023 1 SI1267-00482  2.16  8.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but there is some good news when you look carefully

SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487  5.82 18.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i'm going to start with the factories and vehicles that contaminate the air with a lot of pollution in the form of acid particles which are in smoke
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 18.21 29.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these acid particles are carried by wind which carries them to other zones other areas
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 29.76 34.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and these acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 34.30 42.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and later they could be in rain or snow on our forests or lakes
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 42.34 49.64 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and of course they damage our environment

SI1267-00608-P50023 1 SI1267-00608  0.00 17.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion the university installations are fundamental because a lot of people pay the university only for these reasons

SI1267-00616-P10007 1 SI1267-00616  5.55 18.75 <o,Q5,B1,P1> from the wide range of people i could meet without a doubt i would choose a nobel award winner above all
SI1267-00616-P50020 1 SI1267-00616  0.00  6.16 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i am going to explain my thought as quickly as possible

SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616  0.00  3.61 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i have made my mind up about it
SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616  3.61 19.60 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i have an unshakeable belief that social media as a source of knowledge could be taken into consideration
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616  0.00  5.71 <o,Q5,B1,P5> firstly we need to balance the pros and cons
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616  5.71 17.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i got the answer right funnily enough there is not enough bad news on social media
SI1267-00619-P10005 1 SI1267-00619  0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm fascinated to learn about other countries because i think it can not only expand my horizons but also catch my interest
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619  0.00 13.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve my english is speaking like speaking with foreigners speaking with my classmates speaking with my teachers because speaking can really improve my english
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 13.79 16.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it can help me with writing and reading
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 16.88 18.92 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so speaking is important
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  9.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to learn how to drive a car because when i was a kid i dreamed of having my own car and driving it to wherever i like
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619  9.95 15.13 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if i can learn how to drive a car i can do whatever i want
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619 15.13 18.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's convenient to drive a car
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  3.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> well the advantages are clear
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  3.55  9.34 <o,Q5,C,P3> firstly they can earn some money to support their family and pay for their tuition
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  9.34 14.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> and secondly they can increase their experience of society
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 14.28 16.84 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think there are also drawbacks
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 16.84 28.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> well firstly it is a great waste of time and energy and that will also cause them to do badly in the academic part
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 28.39 35.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> but my own opinion is that i think the advantages are greater than the disadvantages
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 35.21 47.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> because i think with adequate part time jobs you can adapt to society and get used to it instead of studying in the university as a student
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 47.04 54.07 <o,Q5,C,P3> you can get a greater exposure to university and society
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  6.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> factories and vehicles give off smoke and cause pollution
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619  6.84 12.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then acid particles are in the smoke and the acid particles are carried by the wind
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 12.65 20.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and during this process some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with the cloud water
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 20.59 24.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then in the clouds the acid particles form rain and snow
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 24.62 29.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and gradually it falls on the ground and causes damage to the environment

SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 36.62 40.25 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is the formation and effects of acid rain
SI1267-00619-P50019 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  8.33 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you want to develop good eating habits my suggestion is first and foremost you need a balanced diet
SI1267-00619-P50019 1 SI1267-00619  8.33 14.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> a balanced diet can help you when choosing your dishes and the amount you eating
SI1267-00619-P50019 1 SI1267-00619 14.77 19.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> so a balanced diet can bring benefits for your eating habits
SI1267-00619-P50020 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  3.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> water is an essential part of our body
SI1267-00619-P50020 1 SI1267-00619  3.54 10.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> so drinking a lot of water means that you will be energetic and you'll be ready for the stressful day
SI1267-00619-P50020 1 SI1267-00619 10.06 16.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> without enough water you will have a sore throat and you won't be able to focus your attention on your work or studies

SI1267-00619-P50021 1 SI1267-00619  4.96 10.90 <o,Q4,C,P5> because firstly i think doing exercises can build up our body and maintain our health
SI1267-00619-P50021 1 SI1267-00619 10.90 17.48 <o,Q4,C,P5> and secondly i treat exercise as a way to relax myself after my heavy studies
SI1267-00619-P50021 1 SI1267-00619 17.48 18.92 <o,Q4,C,P5> so it's important
SI1267-00619-P50022 1 SI1267-00619  0.00 11.17 <o,Q4,C,P5> people need adequate sleep every night because the next morning they want to be energetic and be ready for the challenges of the day

SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 16.77 28.80 <o,Q4,C,P3> some advantages are that you learn to work for your money and to have something to work for in this case to pay for your studies
SI1267-00722-P30017 1 SI1267-00722 28.80 41.16 <o,Q4,C,P3> a disadvantage is that maybe you will not have enough time to spend on your hobbies with your friends or doing something else that you would prefer doing

SI1267-00874-P10008 1 SI1267-00874  6.75  9.88 <o,Q5,B2,P1> that would be really awesome
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874  0.00  9.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantage would be they would earn money from their jobs of course
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874  9.82 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantage would be they wouldn't have time for studying
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 18.92 23.07 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so yeah that would be a problem
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 23.07 30.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and my opinion about it is it would not be worth it
SI1267-00874-P30017 1 SI1267-00874 30.22 36.15 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think they should just focus on studying

SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 29.93 35.56 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles will mix with the cloud water when it's raining
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 35.56 41.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and later on the acid particles they are going to be in rain or snow
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 41.72 50.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then they're just going to rain and they are going to fall on trees
SI1267-00874-P40018 1 SI1267-00874 50.66 56.97 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is going to cause damage to the environment
SI1267-00874-P50020 1 SI1267-00874  0.00 14.48 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's really important because you can be really hydrated and also it will prevent stones in your kidneys
SI1267-00874-P50022 1 SI1267-00874  0.00 17.32 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion it's important to sleep eight hours at night coz you will have more energy on the next day for like doing exercises or helping your parents with moving stuff
SI1267-00874-P50022 1 SI1267-00874 17.32 19.43 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's really important

SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 18.77 32.16 <o,Q5,C,P3> well on the other hand i reckon learning a new language should not be a condition to get a degree because learning a new language might be hard

SI1267-00915-P30017 1 SI1267-00915 41.68 47.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> so from my point of view i suppose students can study a new language but it should be their choice and universities must encourage them to do that

SI1267-00915-P50023 1 SI1267-00915  6.52 16.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> people are always fascinated by tragedy and death and all the bad things that happen to other people but don't happen to them

SI1267-00946-P10005 1 SI1267-00946 11.88 18.93 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i often go there for walks and to relax
SI1267-00946-P10007 1 SI1267-00946  0.00 18.93 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that is my mother because we have the same personalities like an optimistic attitude towards life so that we often face problems in a positive way
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946  0.00 10.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i think having all students do fitness classes in the school day has several advantages
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 10.27 28.40 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the first one is that students can keep fit while doing the fitness classes and they can relax to relieve the pressures of studying and then they can keep in good shape
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 28.40 44.21 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantage of taking fitness classes is that the time when they used to be studying will be taken up by the fitness classes so the students will have less time to study
SI1267-00946-P30017 1 SI1267-00946 44.21 56.63 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i support the fitness classes and it is really essential for all students to do them

SI1267-00946-P40018 1 SI1267-00946 39.70 49.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this is the process of honey from flower to shop

SI1267-01141-P30017 1 SI1267-01141 37.84 45.88 <o,Q4,C,P3> so maybe these people that work will not have the best exam marks

SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 12.94 25.68 <o,Q4,C,P4> the first and most important i think is that you have to travel to the airport via bus subway or a taxi cab
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 25.68 36.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to check in all your stuff with someone who will later load your stuff into the airplane
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 36.09 45.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to show all your documents to officers and show your hand luggage to security

SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 17.98 20.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> so this is very important

SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647  7.60  9.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> there are six steps
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647  9.33 15.01 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first you go to the airport by car or train
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 15.01 19.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you have to check in

SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 23.07 28.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and third you have to go through security
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 28.81 41.76 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then you can wait and you can go to a restaurant there or have a coffee or go to the toilet
SI127E-00647-P40018 1 SI127E-00647 41.76 46.30 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and then finally you board that airplane

SI127E-00647-P50022 1 SI127E-00647  0.00 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion attending lectures is more effective than reading alone because by attending lectures you can get feedback from other people or someone like the teacher and this is a very effective way to learn or study

SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653  0.00  9.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> one important advantage of taking a job that will pay for university studies is that we don't have to take out a loan
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653  9.14 20.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this is important because we will not find ourselves limited by this loan and spend all the time following our studies having to pay it off
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 20.81 32.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> and a disadvantage of this idea is that sometimes we might be distracted and we might not focus on our studies and might feel like we are wasting our time
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 32.81 38.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i strongly believe that it depends on the courses or the master's you choose
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 38.91 43.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you have enough time you can do a job at the same time
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 43.02 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> however if you are really focused on your studies and you are concentrating and you don't have time at all then i recommend you focus on your studies first and then pay for your university studies by taking out a loan
SI127E-00653-P50019 1 SI127E-00653  0.00 15.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i strongly believe that technology has a great impact on studying because for example the different lectures can be recorded and students can see them another time and try to focus on what they don't understand by checking online

SI127E-00688-P40018 1 SI127E-00688 25.58 34.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then they have to put that nectar inside the beehives

SI127E-00693-P40018 1 SI127E-00693 33.06 53.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> in the delivery process they put the containers inside a car or a vehicle and then they deliver these to a supermarket which is the final phase which enables you to buy it and consume it in your house as a customer

SI127E-00790-P30017 1 SI127E-00790 22.41 49.97 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the disadvantage the main disadvantage would be that of course you would have less time to devote to your studies
SI127E-00790-P50019 1 SI127E-00790  0.00 12.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the most reliable way to learn about international news is reading international newspapers

SI127E-00829-P30017 1 SI127E-00829 22.53 28.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so they have an advantage over the other students
SI127E-00829-P30017 1 SI127E-00829 28.05 47.09 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but one disadvantage is that they might not find the perfect language that they want to learn and they are going to be obligated to learn one when they don't want to

SI127E-00880-P30017 1 SI127E-00880 35.48 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so finally in order to answer the third question to be honest i think it's a good way to keep a healthy style of life so i think schools should offer fitness classes for all the students in order to get a healthy lifestyle

SI127E-00880-P40018 1 SI127E-00880 30.35 53.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when the beekeepers finish this step this honey is packaged in jars ready to be delivered to the shops in order to sell it in all the shops of course wherever they want to sell it

SI127E-00885-P50020 1 SI127E-00885  4.79 17.12 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but probably in the next ten years they won't be published in paper form only online

SI127E-00885-P50021 1 SI127E-00885  2.93 13.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> twitter is the social media platform where all the news moves so fast
SI127E-00885-P50021 1 SI127E-00885 13.11 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and a lot of people read the news on social media
SI127E-00885-P50022 1 SI127E-00885  0.00 15.55 <o,Q4,B1,P5> nowadays when we live with this state of alarm or in this pandemic period the local news is increasing in importance

SI127E-00885-P50023 1 SI127E-00885  0.00 11.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it's partly true because the social media introduce a lot of fake news and bad news

SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921  0.00  8.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> an argument in favour that i would say here is at university you have to study a lot of things
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921  8.56 20.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and some books they are just in english or maybe in other languages so it's important to know other languages to read these books
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 20.54 36.83 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one disadvantage i would say is that not everyone has the opportunity to learn a language because not everyone can pay for a language course
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 36.83 50.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion the government should give classes on university subjects

SI127E-00921-P50019 1 SI127E-00921  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i would say that the way for students to find out international news is on the internet because you can easily find news from all over the world and you can do that for free
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921  0.00  9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i totally agree because i think that nowadays everything is now digital
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921  9.55 18.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so maybe now we only have newspapers on paper because of the old people the elderly

SI127E-00921-P50022 1 SI127E-00921  0.00  7.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's so important because they have to know what is happening in their surroundings

SI127E-00995-P10005 1 SI127E-00995 15.59 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i prefer going out with my friends
SI127E-00995-P10006 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P1> for me it's very important because you need to watch the news maybe not every day but once per week because you must be informed about the things that occur in your country
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 13.30 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well most of my time when i was a child i was with my friends in a park or maybe in the pool in the summer
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995 13.30 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i adored playing with my friends all the time
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  9.62 <o,Q5,B1,P1> obviously i hope to work in the job that i love that is in the lab
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995  9.62 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> probably i will stay in madrid because then there are a lot of opportunities for work
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 13.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for me it's very important to do the things that you will need to do in your future job
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 13.17 22.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and for this reason including a period of practical work experience has a lot of advantages
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 22.56 51.18 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that it hasn't got disadvantages because the theoretical part is very important but the most important things always will be the practical skills and in these cases when you demonstrate the things that you have learnt
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 51.18 57.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for this reason it is really essential to do practical work
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 11.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well we have studied the visits to three new online pop music sites namely tunes net music now and songs for you
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 11.62 32.07 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the most remarkable thing that we can see in this graphic is that since the fifth day both music now's visits and songs for you's visits have decreased
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 32.07 37.94 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and in contrast for tunes net the visits have increased
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 37.94 57.65 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so to sum up although tunes net started with a low number of visits it finished with the highest number of visits
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  8.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> obviously you can have mates who don't think like you
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995  8.38 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and probably you must or you want to work in a way that other people don't like
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  8.01 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think so because obviously everyone must have the ability for think for themselves
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995  8.01 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and if you want everyone to think the same obviously that can be worse for individuals
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 10.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i don't think so because i think that you can have a good team without having face to face teams
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995 10.46 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the key is collaborating with each other and being friends too

SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525  9.53 16.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and by adapt i mean that they will become online newspapers as is happening right now

SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 34.80 45.05 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main disadvantage may be probably that it takes time to learn a different language

SI128D-00069-P30017 1 SI128D-00069  3.72 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P3> first of all it is a very great advantage to know another language because it's so useful in your life and of course to find different types of work
SI128D-00069-P30017 1 SI128D-00069 19.77 36.39 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand it's true that sometimes people are frightened of learning a language because it's so stressful for them

SI128D-00069-P50019 1 SI128D-00069  9.27 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it is always a mobile phone because it's so useful with only three clicks you have all the news around the world

SI128D-00069-P50020 1 SI128D-00069  4.21 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> because nowadays more than ever we live in an age of technology and the newspaper is not very useful and on a mobile phone for example on a tablet you have all the information you need

SI128D-00069-P50022 1 SI128D-00069  3.10 13.74 <o,Q5,B1,P5> from my point of view it's so important because it is true that it is important that you know what is happening in the world

SI128D-00088-P50021 1 SI128D-00088  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,X,P5> yes because if it is a country where they speak another language it is very difficult because of this and the students miss their family i think

SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102  0.00  8.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> students should study at least one foreign language in order to pass their university course
SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102  8.08 22.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages of this are that you know more languages and you are more capable of finding a job and can travel and go to work abroad
SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102 22.73 34.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is that you have less time to study your university subject

SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102 41.17 55.26 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it should not be necessary in order to pass your university course if you don't study a new language
SI128D-00102-P50019 1 SI128D-00102  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the best way for students to learn about international news is to go on the web or social media to learn about the different things that are happening in the world

SI12BD-00187-P50023 1 SI12BD-00187  7.54 14.23 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so the media might report more bad news but actually there are many good things

SI12BD-00344-P50019 1 SI12BD-00344  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> one of the best ways to find international news is download several apps that you can watch on your phone or you can watch international news on your laptop or whatever technology that you have

SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362  0.00  9.83 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think the advantage point is that they can take another language as a second language
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362  9.83 22.00 <o,Q3,B1,P3> on the other hand the disadvantage point is that there are some students who don't want to study a foreign language or who don't need to study a language in order to pass the university course
SI12BD-00362-P30017 1 SI12BD-00362 22.00 28.77 <o,Q3,B1,P3> but in my opinion they should learn a foreign language

SI12BD-00362-P50019 1 SI12BD-00362 14.32 19.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so many people are using smartphones and they can study the international news
SI12BD-00362-P50020 1 SI12BD-00362  0.00 14.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree that there will be no newspapers in the future because maybe in the future we won't need to read newspapers because of the smartphone

SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450  2.38 10.48 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one of the advantages of studying a language is that it will help you in your future job

SI12BD-00450-P30017 1 SI12BD-00450 35.28 42.73 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in my opinion i can say that it's very important to study another language

SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00  6.14 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well so i think that english is really important
SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657  6.14 17.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so knowing how to speak english would open a lot of doors in the market for us
SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657 17.79 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it's really important
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00  8.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantage is the professional development

SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 16.42 32.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so if we have a good level in different languages we will have more open doors than the others who study one foreign language
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 32.05 48.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the main disadvantage is that in most cases at university people have a very busy lifestyle with a lot of work with a lot of exams so it could affect their marks
SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 48.22 59.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that if you are able to study a different language and if you have time you must do it
SI12BD-00657-P50019 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00 14.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that social media is the best way to know about international news because all of the most important video channels of the world have a profile on it
SI12BD-00657-P50019 1 SI12BD-00657 14.34 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI12BD-00657-P50020 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00  3.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree with that in part
SI12BD-00657-P50020 1 SI12BD-00657  3.88 15.11 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that there won't be physical newspapers but online newspapers are a reality nowadays

SI12BD-00657-P50021 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that social media is a reliable source because you can back up your posts with images and videos to give more credibility to your words
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00 17.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that local news is the most important for us because we need to know what's happening near us to know what is going to happen in the future and what is going to happen in the world
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657 17.80 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00  1.86 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i love music
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665  1.86 11.63 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that is my passion and is the most important thing for me because in the future maybe i will be a musician
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 11.63 15.25 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i can play the piano and the guitar
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 15.25 19.86 <o,Q3,B2,P1> and really it's my passion music
SI12BD-00665-P10006 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> travel is my favourite thing in the world because if you want to know different places you need to travel around the country
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00  7.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> currently speaking a language other than your own is of utmost importance
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665  7.05 12.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> at universities students must have a certain level of english to graduate
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 12.54 24.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first the advantages of knowing another language are getting better job opportunities and meeting people from other countries and being able to communicate with them
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 24.80 35.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> learning about the culture of other countries is another advantage of this skill
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 35.84 43.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantage is that it is very exhausting to learn another language because you have to study a lot
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 43.84 55.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion learning another language is a way to open up new horizons in your work life and it also helps you understand other cultures

SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think that's the case because newspapers are traditional means of communication especially for older people
SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665 10.04 15.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i believe that social media provides immediate information

SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691  0.00 24.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the one hand i think it should be essential to learn a foreign language to pass your university course because you're gonna need it for your future career in order to have employment in any area in which you wanna work
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 24.21 35.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> because nowadays all human resources managers ask for an english qualification or a french qualification or something like that
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 35.75 44.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think the disadvantage of this on the other hand is that it's gonna take time from your course
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 44.15 56.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you're gonna have to spend time studying a language that adds to the time you're spending studying for your courses
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 56.58 59.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion this is essential

SI12BD-00691-P50021 1 SI12BD-00691 11.96 19.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> but if you follow the news outlets like that are prestigious you wouldn't have any problem
SI12BD-00691-P50022 1 SI12BD-00691  0.00 18.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my own personal view i don't think it's that important to be up to date on local news because now with globalisation everything that happens in another part of the world can affect you

SI12BD-01020-P30017 1 SI12BD-01020 30.88 52.27 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion the foreign language is important for you and the university but if you fail the subject you won't pass your university course

SI131R-00036-P50023 1 SI131R-00036 14.11 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and it also depends on the newspaper

SI131R-00149-P10008 1 SI131R-00149 16.77 19.77 <o,Q4,C,P1> so it's really beneficial for me
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149  0.00  6.94 <o,Q4,C,P3> well learning a foreign language has advantages and disadvantages
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149  6.94 19.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> and firstly the advantages are that students will get better jobs in the future coz they speak two languages
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 19.56 28.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> also they will develop skills like speaking and thinking
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 28.90 42.74 <o,Q4,C,P3> however the disadvantage is they might not be able to concentrate on more essential courses coz learning a foreign language is very difficult
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 42.74 59.36 <o,Q4,C,P3> overall in my opinion students should choose if they want it or not coz they shouldn't be forced to learn a foreign language
SI131R-00149-P50020 1 SI131R-00149  0.00 16.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes of course coz you know climate change is a big issue and one way to reduce pollution is by reducing the use of paper

SI131R-00149-P50022 1 SI131R-00149 12.37 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can just download the app so you can keep up with the news
SI131R-00149-P50023 1 SI131R-00149  0.00 13.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion they are right coz they just exaggerate the news so they make it worse than it is in real life
SI131R-00149-P50023 1 SI131R-00149 13.84 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also bad news gets a lot of attention so people just focus on the bad news

SI131R-00156-P10007 1 SI131R-00156  3.75 14.26 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like this swimmer because he is able to swim or dive under the water for one or two minutes

SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156  0.00  7.59 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion the advantage is they are able to speak another language for example english
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156  7.59 20.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and when they start to work in a new job they can find jobs for example in restaurants or hotels or as teachers

SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 26.76 29.13 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but there are some disadvantages
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 29.13 37.36 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for example they are going to have less time for studying other subjects like biology or maths

SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 29.47 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P3> so i think it's a big advantage

SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 18.03 30.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example if we are too tired and overwhelmed by the subject that we are majoring in we can't spend more time on other things for example learning another language
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 30.91 39.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if we spend too much time on learning another language we can't concentrate on the subject that we are majoring in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 39.00 42.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is just keep a good balance
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 42.18 48.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it depends if you are too tired with your study work you don't have to attend a foreign language class
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 48.83 52.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you just need to concentrate on the subject that you are majoring in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 52.70 57.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and everyone should be flexible about their opinion
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200  0.00  6.08 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way for me to understand the international news is by searching online
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200  6.08 18.58 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example we can use the b b c or the v o a to read some news online and then we can have a better understanding of what is happening in the world
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200  0.00 15.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i do not fully agree with this idea but i think newspapers will be on the decrease because with the development of technology we can always watch the news on our phones instead of reading a newspaper
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200 15.02 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so in that way the number of newspapers will be on the decrease

SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 30.17 46.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disadvantage for me is the level or the difficulty because studying a language is not easy and you need to spend a lot of time studying
SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 46.66 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion if you have the opportunity to learn a foreign language try to do it because it will be better for your future

SI131R-00655-P10008 1 SI131R-00655  8.23 14.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when you speak a second language especially english it will open so many doors for you

SI131R-00655-P50020 1 SI131R-00655  0.00  6.25 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think there will be newspapers but without paper
SI131R-00655-P50020 1 SI131R-00655  6.25 20.11 <o,Q4,B1,P5> then you will check it on the internet on your tablet or mobile phone but you will not be able to buy a physical newspaper

SI131R-00655-P50021 1 SI131R-00655 12.75 19.53 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but i think you should have a look first in the newspaper

SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667  0.00  7.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's a fact that studying languages is really important for our future life
SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667  7.92 23.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so about the advantages one positive point is that students can learn other languages so that they can move to another country and have no problem
SI131R-00667-P30017 1 SI131R-00667 23.27 37.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the second place regarding disadvantages an argument against is that maybe they could have more time for themselves instead of studying

SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 11.54 19.68 <o,Q4,C,P3> one of the main benefits is that it may help you find a better job
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 19.68 29.74 <o,Q4,C,P3> when you study at university in the end you try to get training to improve your skills
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 29.74 35.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> and your goal is that when you leave that university you find a good job
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 35.02 39.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> so learning another language will help you with this
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 39.91 51.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand one drawback is that you will have less time to study for your degree
SI137O-00282-P30017 1 SI137O-00282 51.21 59.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion you have enough time to study absolutely everything

SI137O-00282-P50019 1 SI137O-00282  7.91 11.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> all you need to have is a good internet connection

SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282  0.00  3.50 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i disagree with the statement
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282  3.50  8.62 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think newspapers will continue existing in the future
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282  8.62 11.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however they will need to change
SI137O-00282-P50020 1 SI137O-00282 11.86 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they will have to become more digital and adapt to a new era

SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282  2.22  7.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think social media is a good way to broadcast fake news
SI137O-00282-P50021 1 SI137O-00282  7.53 11.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's not reliable at all

SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282  0.00  6.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it's really important to be up to date with your local news

SI137O-00282-P50022 1 SI137O-00282 13.50 15.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but in my opinion it's a mistake

SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282  0.00  4.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes maybe there is too much bad news in the media
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282  4.79 11.22 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but that is a reflection of what really happens in the world
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 11.22 17.16 <o,Q5,B2,P5> on the other hand the media just want to get more audience
SI137O-00282-P50023 1 SI137O-00282 17.16 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so that's what people want to hear
SI137O-00490-P10005 1 SI137O-00490  0.00  8.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like listening to a wide range of music such as pop music country music and classical music
SI137O-00490-P10005 1 SI137O-00490  8.61 13.09 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so the music i like to listen to covers a wide range of genres

SI137O-00490-P10007 1 SI137O-00490 15.42 19.86 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i really want to exchange views with him
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490  0.00  8.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> nowadays many students are required to study at least one foreign language in their university study plan
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490  8.31 11.43 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think there are many advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 11.43 22.54 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first of all students who study at least one foreign language such as english can communicate with a native english speaker better
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 22.54 33.80 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and nowadays most of the papers are written in english so if they want to deepen their understanding of these academic papers they need to learn english
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 33.80 42.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but for many students that won't talk with these foreigners for a long time it will just waste time
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 42.71 49.95 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in conclusion i think it's necessary to study at least one foreign language coz china is becoming a more and more international country now
SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490  0.00 14.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with this point but i think it may take a long time for this to happen because many people like to read the news in the newspaper and they don't know how to use the internet
SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490 14.38 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but the media is more convenient nowadays

SI137O-00490-P50023 1 SI137O-00490  5.47 15.16 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but i think it's not a big deal because the bad news you can ignore it for sure

SI137O-00596-P10005 1 SI137O-00596  9.32 13.75 <o,Q5,C,P1> i enjoy for example listening to it with my friends
SI137O-00596-P10005 1 SI137O-00596 13.75 19.26 <o,Q5,C,P1> or yeah just a lot of genres a lot of bands

SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  2.81 <o,Q5,C,P1> as with music i enjoy it a lot
SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596  2.81 13.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have done it a lot with my parents with friends where for example in the summer i go to colombia and travel with friends
SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596 13.46 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example we go to a friend's house in the mountains and it's pretty cool
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  3.74 <o,Q5,C,P1> well speaking english is always an advantage
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596  3.74 11.68 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can communicate with a lot of people from different countries because the language is so international
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596 11.68 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example with some friends who don't speak either german or spanish i can communicate with them through english
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  8.85 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think it helps students like stimulate another part of the brain
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596  8.85 22.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> mostly if you're just studying like a scientific major like in my case your exercises and activities are pretty much the same throughout the whole course
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 22.91 26.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> a lot of monotony and pretty homogeneous
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 26.89 38.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> and if you have to study at least one foreign language you will have to develop other skills that don't come from your major
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 38.88 42.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it could have advantages
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 42.30 48.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage is it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice and you really don't have that much time
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 48.82 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think maybe english is ok because it really is helpful in your life but for other languages it's maybe not that important
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  8.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well with new technologies probably like follow some instagram accounts of news that are from other countries
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596  8.88 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and if you're really interested and you really get to search every day for news then you can do it that way
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596  0.00 10.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well maybe not newspapers as we know them now in that physical form but i think in digital form they will have a lot of impact
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596 10.88 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and with that much misinformation going on it's really important to have reliable sources
SI137O-00596-P50021 1 SI137O-00596  0.00 16.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> as i said previously social media is not really a very reliable source but some pages on social media can be reliable sources like important newspapers

SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  6.05 <o,Q4,B2,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016  6.05 13.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> he's a former professional goalkeeper and he was my idol when i was a kid
SI137O-01016-P10007 1 SI137O-01016 13.45 19.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so it would be so amazing to have a conversation with him
SI137O-01016-P10008 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  9.77 <o,Q4,B2,P1> nowadays with globalisation every job demands we speak english fluently
SI137O-01016-P10008 1 SI137O-01016  9.77 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so speaking english is a skill that everybody will need in the future and for sure it would help me to find new jobs
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016  0.00 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in spain the country i live in it is mandatory to study one foreign language or to have a b one level in a foreign language to pass the university course
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 16.38 30.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i think it's totally fair since you will need to learn for example english or another foreign language in your future jobs
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 30.30 39.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 39.48 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however the disadvantage is that for people who do not find it that easy to learn new languages it can be an added difficulty to passing their university course
SI137O-01016-P50019 1 SI137O-01016  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> the best way for students to find out about international news is to search on the internet for the main newspapers that cover international main events for example the times the new york times or the b b c
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  5.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> well the future of the newspaper is not known
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016  5.83 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> however what i think is that the newspaper on paper will disappear however the newspaper the online web newspaper will remain active
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  6.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> as i see it social media is not a reliable source of news at all
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016  6.62 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> social media is a place where people post how they want to look how they want their lives to appear and where fake news is everywhere
SI137O-01016-P50022 1 SI137O-01016  0.00 10.46 <o,Q4,C,P5> it is super important in my opinion to be aware and to be up to date with what is happening in your city
SI137O-01016-P50022 1 SI137O-01016 10.46 17.90 <o,Q4,C,P5> so checking local news frequently is a thing that we all should do
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  6.29 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think there is both good and bad news in the media
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016  6.29 15.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> however it is obvious that we will focus on bad news and that bad news is the news that we will remember most clearly
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016 15.83 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> and also it's important to show that the world is not a good place
