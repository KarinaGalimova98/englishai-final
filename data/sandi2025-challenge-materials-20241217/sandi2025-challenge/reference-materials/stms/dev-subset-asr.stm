SI114J-00045-P10005 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 13.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> as i said before i am from a little village in north spain in the middle of nowhere and and i live in mountains so i'm very very interested in environment
SI114J-00045-P10005 1 SI114J-00045 13.04 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i think that global global heat is a
SI114J-00045-P10006 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 5.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> what we enjoy the most is playing video games
SI114J-00045-P10006 1 SI114J-00045 5.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we love a lot of to play counter strike global offensive which is a video game a shooter game where teams of five (%hesitation%) fight
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 4.34 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am most similar to my father
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 4.34 16.81 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i have not only in in a physical way but in a intellectual way we have similar ways of thought and of think
SI114J-00045-P10007 1 SI114J-00045 16.81 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and we have a lot of a
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 3.43 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to live in a city
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 3.43 16.27 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i like most the cities i like the most are london paris (%hesitation%) and here in spain i would like to live in in madrid or in barcelona
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 16.27 17.46 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i don't care
SI114J-00045-P10008 1 SI114J-00045 17.46 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but yeah i would like to live (i-)
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 14.10 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that nowadays one of the biggest problems that we affront as a society is mental and physical health
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 14.10 37.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that school and college should make time in the school to practice some exercises and and to promote a more fitness lifestyle because it can help (%hesitation%) to fight those physical and both physical and mental health
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 37.78 54.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time the disadvantage of of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as as a study time or learning some other things
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 54.21 60.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time maybe not everyone will enjoy because not everyone like
SI114J-00045-P40018 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 60.00 <o,Q5,B1,P4> honey is collected from bees
SI114J-00045-P50019 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 16.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that when a student is chosen a country to go to study there (%hesitation%) the first thing that they are thinking about is about the university quality
SI114J-00045-P50019 1 SI114J-00045 16.10 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time at the same level (univers-)
SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 11.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the best thing of studying in a second language is that you can put in in your resume
SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 11.76 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time it is a very valuable thing from that enterprises value
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of constraints when you're studying in another country
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 6.79 16.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all you have to learn a new language and talk in a new language or in a second in your second language
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045 16.79 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and overall i think that
SI114J-00045-P50022 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 14.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that students can learn (%hesitation%) from local culture (%hesitation%) going with their classmates and and learning from them asking them
SI114J-00045-P50022 1 SI114J-00045 14.01 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time i think a good way is just taking a walk and and (visi-)
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything (a-) at your own
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 11.12 20.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have to to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you don't do when you live alone
SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 8.13 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 8.13 9.90 <o,Q4,B1,P1> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 9.90 14.98 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is to one hour to barcelona (%hesitation%) to half an hour to the to the beach
SI114J-00206-P10005 1 SI114J-00206 14.98 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's a nice place
SI114J-00206-P10006 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 9.52 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in holiday i enjoy staying with friends and going to the mountains sometimes to the beach
SI114J-00206-P10006 1 SI114J-00206 9.52 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoying in general the nature and without (%hesitation%) obligations without (%hesitation%) club
SI114J-00206-P10007 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 5.68 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my close family maybe with my mother
SI114J-00206-P10007 1 SI114J-00206 5.68 20.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my (don-) in my second close family maybe with my brother in law
SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 7.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am not sure but one possibility of job is as a teacher
SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206 7.42 20.00 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is the one of my favorite jobs now
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that one (ad-) advantage is that (%hesitation%) while you are working you are learning what is the life and the same time you are studying of course
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 15.50 28.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that maybe you you are too much busy working and studying at the same time than you can turn a little stressed
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 28.71 35.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and is this is (%hesitation%) this isn't a good thing for the healthy
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 35.86 43.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that is a good idea do the the both things at the same time working and studying
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 43.56 60.00 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because (%hesitation%) working you can learn a lot of things that you can't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you can't learn while working
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 13.49 <o,Q4,A2,P4> (%hesitation%) for to travelling by airplane first you must arrive to the airport by car by train or by coach
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 13.49 18.05 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then when you are here you must check in
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 18.05 24.84 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after check in you must pass the document control where you need your passport
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 24.84 40.85 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after pass the document control you must pass the security tunnel where you can where you can you are you must (%hesitation%) (%hesitation%) leave the some things that are dangerous
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 40.85 48.33 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after the security control you must wait for the boarding moment
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 48.33 54.05 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then while you can take (%hesitation%) some lunch or coffee when you are boarding
SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 54.05 60.00 <o,Q4,A2,P4> after you board you can fly to your destination
SI114J-00206-P50019 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> i think that the technology can can improve the study because you can find (%hesitation%) faster (%hesitation%) in the information and at the same time you can stay in connecting with (oth-) with other bit of people
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 3.53 <o,Q5,A2,P5> me too i think the same
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 3.53 15.16 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think that the face to face you can you are more (%hesitation%) more interested at with the person with them
SI114J-00206-P50020 1 SI114J-00206 15.16 20.00 <o,Q5,A2,P5> and you can (%hesitation%) interpretate the the non verbal
SI114J-00206-P50021 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> with group projects the people can improve develop (%hesitation%) the the past the patience the the quiet listening and thinking (%hesitation%) more deep and the communication more efficient
SI114J-00206-P50022 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> in my case i think that it's better (%hesitation%) reading alone because i prefer the silent and (%hesitation%) the quietness and the calm
SI114J-00206-P50023 1 SI114J-00206 0.00 10.77 <o,Q4,A2,P5> it's important because not all the people have the possibility to to to have the all facilities
SI114J-00206-P50023 1 SI114J-00206 10.77 20.00 <o,Q4,A2,P5> then we must to to give all the modern facilities (th-) to to to all the students to
