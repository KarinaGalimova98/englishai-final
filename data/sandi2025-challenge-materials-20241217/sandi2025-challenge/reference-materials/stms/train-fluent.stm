SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031  0.00  3.02 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i love to travel
SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031  3.02 11.89 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i travel to the paris to the roma to the madrid to the barcelona
SI114J-00031-P10006 1 SI114J-00031 11.89 15.34 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in summary i enjoy travelling
SI114J-00031-P10008 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 14.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think that speaking english help me to give a class of the physical education in a college in the future
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 20.81 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one advantage could be that you will learn one foreign language and you can speak this language in the country where speaking this language
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031 20.81 33.17 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one disadvantage could be that if you don't need one foreign language in the future you have obligation
SI114J-00031-P30017 1 SI114J-00031 33.17 57.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that you shouldn't pay the exam to pass the university course because if you don't need one foreign language it is have cost very much
SI114J-00031-P50020 1 SI114J-00031  0.00  2.51 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yes i agree
SI114J-00031-P50020 1 SI114J-00031  2.51 16.53 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the newspaper will disappear because in the internet you can read the news without to pay nothing
SI114J-00031-P50021 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 18.92 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion the social media will never reliable because in it you can write what you thinks and many people invent many things
SI114J-00031-P50022 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 18.75 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that is very important to keep up of the local news because this way you can prevent many things for example the traffic of the city
SI114J-00031-P50023 1 SI114J-00031  0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that in the media exist many bad news but this news serves to sell and to attract many people to earn money
SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  1.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot

SI114J-00077-P10005 1 SI114J-00077 11.39 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i think it's very important for them to be recognised in the society because there are so many tracks and artists
SI114J-00077-P10006 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  5.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say a lot because for me it's very important to discover new places

SI114J-00077-P10007 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  5.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say rafael nadal who is a tennis player and a spanish player

SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  9.28 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my case i'm finishing my degree it's about how to be i mean how to administrate a business
SI114J-00077-P10008 1 SI114J-00077  9.28 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i would say that a lot because in the future probably i would need it for talking to people from wales or in england for making some business
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077  0.00  6.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion the best way is going to the internet and searching for the news that they are interest in
SI114J-00077-P50019 1 SI114J-00077  6.75 18.55 <o,Q3,C,P5> should take a look for media like for example b b c or c n n so they have like a regular perspective of what is happening around the world

SI114J-00077-P50020 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 16.75 <o,Q3,C,P5> i have to disagree with this assumption because for example in emergence countries like brazil or indonesia they will need newspaper also because they don't have access to the internet connection in all the areas

SI114J-00077-P50022 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 12.64 <o,Q3,C,P5> local news are essential for bringing the community together because thanks to it we know what's happening in our local town or in our village for example
SI114J-00077-P50022 1 SI114J-00077 12.64 19.86 <o,Q3,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077  0.00 14.17 <o,Q3,C,P5> in my opinion i think that that is true because there are a lot of bad news around the world and also with the coronated pandemic we see like more of it
SI114J-00077-P50023 1 SI114J-00077 14.17 19.86 <o,Q3,C,P5> so i think that the important thing of the news is to inform
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 14.18 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's a very quiet and residential neighbour but like five hundred meters away from here we have a very beautiful forest with a lot animals
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 14.18 15.58 <o,Q4,C,P1> we have a river
SI114J-00088-P10005 1 SI114J-00088 15.58 19.97 <o,Q4,C,P1> so during the weekends i used to go there
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  1.76 <o,Q4,C,P1> it depends
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  1.76  6.48 <o,Q4,C,P1> for example during summer holidays i love to travel
SI114J-00088-P10006 1 SI114J-00088  6.48 11.06 <o,Q4,C,P1> i usually go to warm places with my friends

SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  3.85 <o,Q4,C,P1> right now it is not very clear for me
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  3.85  9.07 <o,Q4,C,P1> i know i would love to do something related with business
SI114J-00088-P10008 1 SI114J-00088  9.07 19.84 <o,Q4,C,P1> but the thing that i have the most clear is that i wanna have a job that requires to travel a lot and to be in a lot of cities
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 21.57 <o,Q4,C,P3> so on the one hand we have the advantages of getting a job for paying the universitary studies is that you free your parents' responsibilities of paying also you get more experience even though it is something that is not related to your degree
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 21.57 26.99 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you may have additional income for the weekends or for holidays
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 26.99 36.00 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand you can not live properly the universitary lifestyle
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 36.00 47.60 <o,Q4,C,P3> and also you may be a little bit more stressed because of the subjects of the university because you don't have as many time as other peers
SI114J-00088-P30017 1 SI114J-00088 47.60 59.66 <o,Q4,C,P3> but in my opinion it is very useful and very important to have a job but maybe a part time job and not a full time
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> ok so today's presentation is about travelling by airplane
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088  5.34 13.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> as you all know the airplane is one of the few means of communication that we have right now
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 13.14 16.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> so first of all we'll have to go to the airports
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 16.16 19.34 <o,Q4,C,P4> that is a place where the flights leave
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 19.34 24.22 <o,Q4,C,P4> so once we get in there we will have to check in
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 24.22 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> that means giving some people that works for the company we are flying with our information so they will give us our tickets
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 32.97 35.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> and we can give them our luggage
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 35.57 41.38 <o,Q4,C,P4> then we'll go through the document control and after that the security
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 41.38 49.97 <o,Q4,C,P4> they will check that everything that we have in our luggage and that we are able to go to the other place because we have the visas
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 49.97 53.11 <o,Q4,C,P4> we'll have to wait a little bit until we board
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 53.11 56.96 <o,Q4,C,P4> the boarding time is thirty minutes before the flight
SI114J-00088-P40018 1 SI114J-00088 56.96 58.29 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then leave
SI114J-00088-P50019 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 19.97 <o,Q4,C,P5> so for example the technology could be very useful when doing our research for example because instead of having to use an encylopedia they can use other websites that you can find that tell more into detail about those themes
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> i really think so because if you are face to face with your teacher you have to pay attention to him and you will be more able to understand what he's saying and to ask questions in real life
SI114J-00088-P50020 1 SI114J-00088 15.25 19.93 <o,Q4,C,P5> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088  0.00 10.64 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's very important working in groups because in the future you'll need to work in groups with other workmates
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 10.64 15.74 <o,Q4,C,P5> and i don't know like a lot of skills are developed while working in groups
SI114J-00088-P50021 1 SI114J-00088 15.74 19.93 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think like the most important ones are the soft skills
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.79 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course and it is the same reasoning as the face to face
SI114J-00088-P50022 1 SI114J-00088  5.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> because if you have any questions while you are there you can obviously ask in the moment or i dunno after class

SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088  0.00  5.35 <o,Q4,C,P5> even though i think it's important i don't think it's the most important thing
SI114J-00088-P50023 1 SI114J-00088  5.35 13.45 <o,Q4,C,P5> i mean you obviously gotta have like a library some computers in order to let people do research

SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  9.09 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well to know about other countries for me is something always very exciting and very nice
SI114J-00123-P10005 1 SI114J-00123  9.09 13.63 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i am very excited to know about other countries
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  9.62 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i can't i like to go away to the countryside with some friends some family and take funny times
SI114J-00123-P10006 1 SI114J-00123  9.62 15.85 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if it's possible make some barbecues with them and just have fun
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  6.23 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my english i think the best way it's to learn and to practice and practice and practice again
SI114J-00123-P10007 1 SI114J-00123  6.23 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so to improve my personal english i will hear more documentals or t v programmes or read more books in english
SI114J-00123-P10008 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 16.53 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would like to learn to fly drones because it's something that maybe it could help me in my work to make some photos in the air of some buildings or some spaces
SI114J-00123-P50019 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> okay so i will suggest them to control the meals because have a good timing with that it's something important and to have that regularly in your days is something important to eating habits
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 16.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that drinking water is always important not just to have a healthy lifestyle or to be healthy because you have to drink two liters of water per day if you can
SI114J-00123-P50020 1 SI114J-00123 16.88 18.92 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's the recommendation
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 11.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> of course it's something essential to feel good with yourself and to be healthy you have to do exercise the time that you need
SI114J-00123-P50021 1 SI114J-00123 11.59 19.44 <o,Q5,C,P5> you don't have to to take every day five hours but a little time yes
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123  0.00  3.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that it's not essential to sleep eight hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123  3.79 11.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> you can be productive and you can be healthy just sleeping seven six hours
SI114J-00123-P50022 1 SI114J-00123 11.06 17.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> you have to find the kind of hours you need for your body
SI114J-00123-P50023 1 SI114J-00123  0.00 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that both because you can use the technology to be more healthy with some activities or application advices or in other case you can use it for bad healthy routines
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132  0.00  3.97 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i'm really interested in the environment
SI114J-00132-P10005 1 SI114J-00132  3.97  7.21 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that we must respect it

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132  0.00 11.50 <o,Q3,B2,P3> doing fitness classes is really important to everybody because it has a lot of advantages
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 11.50 33.67 <o,Q3,B2,P3> some of them are that you are going to have a healthy life and you're going to learn to organise your time during the day because you don't have only to study you also need to have time to do another things
SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 33.67 38.76 <o,Q3,B2,P3> so fitness classes can be like a hobby

SI114J-00132-P30017 1 SI114J-00132 56.55 59.19 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion it is necessary
SI114J-00132-P40018 1 SI114J-00132  0.00  8.93 <o,Q3,B2,P4> the honey is a really natural food that you can eat during your breakfast for example

SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269  9.89 12.65 <o,Q5,C,P1> he has strong views on a lot of things
SI114J-00269-P10007 1 SI114J-00269 12.65 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think he has the wisdom to give me advice for my life my professional life and also personal life
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  9.99 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it will help me a lot mostly in my professional life as i'm going to work in an international company
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269  9.99 15.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i will need to communicate in english with all my colleagues throughout the world
SI114J-00269-P10008 1 SI114J-00269 15.70 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and also personally it will help me a lot travelling i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  4.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> well of course i think it's extremely important to learn a foreign language
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269  4.88 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all speaking two languages really open your minds i think
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 10.71 23.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> it opens your minds not only to a new language but also to a whole new culture because most of the time you don't only learn a new language you also learn about the history of the country of the language you are learning
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 23.62 35.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if it's spain you're gonna learn about the america latin region also about the history of spain portugal et cetera
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 35.62 37.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it's extremely important
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 37.47 40.01 <o,Q5,C,P3> and then i think it depends on where you're from
SI114J-00269-P30017 1 SI114J-00269 40.01 56.81 <o,Q5,C,P3> because if you are already from america or english and you are a native english speaker i think it's a little bit less important than for example if you're from a country and you don't speak english since english is the predominant language in our modern society

SI114J-00269-P50019 1 SI114J-00269  0.00 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the best way it is to actually follow a media in your country which already select and collect and give you a summary of the news around the world

SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  3.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think newspapers will take a different form
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269  3.06 10.59 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think we will lose the papers in the newspapers and i think it would be more technology driven digital driven
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 10.59 18.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think web platform will always exist from now on and yeah newspaper will just take a different form
SI114J-00269-P50020 1 SI114J-00269 18.27 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> it will be more on the internet
SI114J-00269-P50021 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  4.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> most of the time yeah but that's the tricky thing with for example fake news
SI114J-00269-P50021 1 SI114J-00269  4.46 19.43 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's that you see generally ninety percent of actual facts and then there are ten percent where you have to cross sources make sure it's a reliable source et cetera
SI114J-00269-P50022 1 SI114J-00269  0.00  3.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> i don't think it's much important to follow the local news to be honest

SI114J-00283-P10007 1 SI114J-00283  0.00 15.10 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think the best way for me to enhance my english is doing more and more practice about listening reading speaking and writing because these are the four important factors of english
SI114J-00283-P10007 1 SI114J-00283 15.10 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i want to improve then i must do more and more practice on them
SI114J-00283-P10008 1 SI114J-00283  0.00  8.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> if i learn new skills it would be related to computer system also information technology
SI114J-00283-P10008 1 SI114J-00283  8.31 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> it should includes softwares like java and other types because they are very important for me in future so i want to learn them all
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283  0.00 13.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> during study the university students should do part time job in order to pay their university fees and other dues
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 13.25 17.52 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are cons and pros to this
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 17.52 22.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> so now i'm going to explain each and every one with more detail

SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 29.07 38.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> if the university student do part time job with their study then they will be able to pay their tuition fees and also the university fees
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 38.87 44.23 <o,Q4,C,P3> and secondly they will be more independent of their family
SI114J-00283-P30017 1 SI114J-00283 44.23 56.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> however there are some disadvantages to this because it takes time to do part time job and they will be inable to give more time to their study

SI114J-00283-P50020 1 SI114J-00283  0.00 12.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to drink much water because water is necessary for our health activities mostly in the metabolism reactions in our body
SI114J-00283-P50020 1 SI114J-00283 12.48 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so water also needed for circulation system in our body
SI114J-00283-P50021 1 SI114J-00283  0.00 12.18 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my opinion yes it is important to do some physical exercise every day because physical exercise are more necessary for a good physical health

SI114J-00283-P50022 1 SI114J-00283  9.48 17.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and if people sleep more than eight hours then it would be affected for health

SI114J-00298-P10007 1 SI114J-00298  0.00 13.35 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i suppose trying to use the language and reading a lot of texts in english and maybe you were doing exercise
SI114J-00298-P30017 1 SI114J-00298  0.00 10.42 <o,Q3,B2,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they have more advantages

SI114J-00300-P30017 1 SI114J-00300 31.16 59.23 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion this is a good opportunity for the students because when you are working and at the same time you have to go to the university you can balance your time and you learn more about how to manage your own time

SI114J-00517-P50019 1 SI114J-00517  0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that the best way is to search in the internet about international news because it's a good tool that you can use and have information in just seconds

SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 28.29 34.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> about the disvantage i don't think there are really any disvantage
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 34.76 48.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> perhaps in the last courses they don't have enough time because they have a lot of material of his own course but it's not really a disvantage
SI114J-00579-P30017 1 SI114J-00579 48.49 57.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion as more language you know would be better for you

SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579  3.53  8.05 <o,Q4,B2,P5> every day we use more and more technology
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579  8.05 13.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> we have to reduce our paper consume
SI114J-00579-P50020 1 SI114J-00579 13.41 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i suppose we'll search the news in the internet
SI114J-00579-P50021 1 SI114J-00579  0.00  6.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion social media are not a reliable way of news

SI114J-00579-P50023 1 SI114J-00579  0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> by one way i guess to know the bad news to know it is important to know what happen in the world
SI114J-00579-P50023 1 SI114J-00579 11.94 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but by other way other hand we get used to the bad news and is not so important

SI114J-00591-P10006 1 SI114J-00591  4.86 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and my most favourite way to pass this time is going to some pub or some bar having dinner outside but mostly have some beers with my people

SI114J-00591-P10007 1 SI114J-00591  6.78 14.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we would like to go to bars we would like to do some easy sport for example go for a long walkings around the town

SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591  0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i can see that one of advantages of having a job for your university fees could be that you feel like i don't know like a self achievement
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 14.76 20.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i think that the disadvantages are far more important
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 20.45 33.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> like if you spend most of the time working at a job it is difficult for you to really get good student time
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 33.49 44.26 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that university students have to work for paying their studies
SI114J-00591-P30017 1 SI114J-00591 44.26 57.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand there should be the government who provide scholarships for all the people to go the university in case that they really want to do it
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the first part you need to achieve is to get into the airport
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591  7.03 14.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so for this you could choose your own vehicle or just get some of the public transport that your city provide
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 14.29 17.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it could be buses or the metro
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 17.66 22.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you get into the airport you should check in firstly
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 22.14 32.97 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you will have to show your i d information your i d document for the security people
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 32.97 43.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> also you will need to show your luggage in order for the security people to control that there's not any weapon inside
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 43.91 48.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just need to wait for your plane to leave
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 48.34 53.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the moment of getting into the plane is very easy
SI114J-00591-P40018 1 SI114J-00591 53.70 57.99 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you just need to follow the arrows and then you will be ready to fly
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.25 <o,Q4,C,P5> the main way to use technology for studying is to use it to get information

SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 13.15 18.39 <o,Q4,C,P5> so you just need to have a laptop or maybe a phone
SI114J-00591-P50019 1 SI114J-00591 18.39 19.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> that's all
SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591  0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> well i believe face to face learning with a teacher it's the best way i think to create some confidence between the lecturer and the pupils
SI114J-00591-P50020 1 SI114J-00591 10.61 19.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> and for the students to be confident about resolving doubts asking questions and maybe get more information
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.82 <o,Q4,C,P5> group projects provide the students the opportunity to work in collaboration to other person
SI114J-00591-P50021 1 SI114J-00591  7.82 19.26 <o,Q4,C,P5> and the most important thing of this i think it is that they can learn how to improve their work with the opinion of the other colleagues
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591  0.00  7.63 <o,Q4,C,P5> attending lectures is more effective than reading alone only when the lecturer is a good one
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591  7.63 11.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> but sadly this is not always the situation
SI114J-00591-P50022 1 SI114J-00591 11.04 19.26 <o,Q4,C,P5> so i think this question just depends on what are the lecturing skills in education
SI114J-00591-P50023 1 SI114J-00591  0.00 11.10 <o,Q4,C,P5> nowadays it is vital for universities to provide modern facilities because universities can't run by living outside the real world

SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 12.63 24.40 <o,Q4,C,P4> with the development of modern industries factories and vehicles produce pollution in the form of smoke which has acid particles in them

SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 29.17 43.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the acid particles come to the higher level of the atmosphere some acid particles fall as dust while other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 43.59 52.59 <o,Q4,C,P4> when the temperature drops some acid particles falls in the form of rain or snow
SI114J-00653-P40018 1 SI114J-00653 52.59 59.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> and eventually it will do damage to the environment

SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734  0.00 11.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one of the advantages is that do exercise is very important for our health
SI114J-00734-P30017 1 SI114J-00734 11.21 25.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so if the students do exercise during the day in the school they don't have to do it when they are out of schools and have time to do their homework

SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 10.44 18.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> it is a very natural process where the bees make honey from the nectar in beehives
SI114J-00734-P40018 1 SI114J-00734 18.89 38.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they have to be in calm and quiet because if they feel some danger around them it could be dangerous for the beekeepers that are collecting honey from beehives

SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 15.96 35.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when this pollution or polluted air comes out of the vehicles and factories those acid particles are flown into the air as smoke flown into the air and carried by wind and it gets mixed up with clouds
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 35.24 42.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and in those clouds the acid is mixed with some cloud water
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 42.33 52.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when the acid is mixed with the cloud water acid particles are now in rain or the snow
SI114J-00767-P40018 1 SI114J-00767 52.00 59.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so when it rains it will damage the environment or the surrounding trees

SI1267-00010-P30017 1 SI1267-00010  6.30 11.92 <o,Q3,C,P3> for example the students make friend from different countries which is a very good point

SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060  0.00  5.42 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think there are two ways to improve my english
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060  5.42 12.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> first is to making conversations with foreigners
SI1267-00060-P10007 1 SI1267-00060 12.25 19.67 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and on the other hand i want to travel around to chat with the local people
SI1267-00104-P10007 1 SI1267-00104  0.00 10.90 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is speaking it a lot and also seeing series films or listening to the radio in english
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  6.15 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would love to have the skill to learn different languages without trouble
SI1267-00104-P10008 1 SI1267-00104  6.15 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> as i said before i love different cultures which involve languages and for me it would be an amazing skill
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  7.38 <o,Q4,C,P3> as we all know doing part time jobs while you are studying has some disadvantages but also some advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104  7.38 10.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> i would like to start with advantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 10.14 20.06 <o,Q4,C,P3> okay so if you think about doing part time jobs while you are studying the first thing that comes to your mind is that you are going to start to experience your life like an adult
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 20.06 30.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> you're going to leave behind your teenage years and start making money saving money and also be more busy during the day
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 30.90 33.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> although there are some disadvantages
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 33.58 41.42 <o,Q4,C,P3> you are going to lose time of being with your friends practicing some sport or maybe things like that
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 41.42 43.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> also from studying
SI1267-00104-P30017 1 SI1267-00104 43.64 54.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i would love to do part time jobs when studying because that way i would spend my own money in everything that i want
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104  0.00 10.44 <o,Q4,C,P5> of course a person can stay woken up without sleeping more than eight hours but it affects badly to health
SI1267-00104-P50022 1 SI1267-00104 10.44 16.19 <o,Q4,C,P5> we should sleep eight or more than eight hours every day
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104  0.00  9.95 <o,Q4,C,P5> from my point of view technology has affected in a good way to our mental health but in a mad way to our physical health
SI1267-00104-P50023 1 SI1267-00104  9.95 18.58 <o,Q4,C,P5> because when we are with the mobile phone we do some strain postures we don't sleep as much as we have we don't do exercise
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  4.11 <o,Q4,X,P1> i really enjoy travelling to different places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  4.11  7.12 <o,Q4,X,P1> is good to know a lot of places
SI1267-00105-P10006 1 SI1267-00105  7.12 17.73 <o,Q4,X,P1> i enjoy more nature places where i can go with my dog and green areas you know something like that
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  2.97 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't know
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  2.97  5.39 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't like famous people
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105  5.39 12.82 <o,Q4,X,P1> i don't watch that kind of news
SI1267-00105-P10007 1 SI1267-00105 12.82 19.26 <o,Q4,X,P1> and i don't get impressive by any famous people
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,X,P1> in my view english is the future language that everybody will need to know
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105  8.20 14.21 <o,Q4,X,P1> so to communicate with anyone around the world you need the english
SI1267-00105-P10008 1 SI1267-00105 14.21 19.77 <o,Q4,X,P1> so i think it will be very useful for me and for everyone
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105  0.00 16.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> to get started i'm gonna put forward the pros and cons about studying at least one foreign language and that it is necessary to pass the university course for the students
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 16.07 32.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the right side it will help the students themselves to broadener their minds and to improve their knowledge of the world
SI1267-00105-P30017 1 SI1267-00105 32.29 51.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other side wasting time in trying to learn another language could may as well led the students to give up earlier their university course
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  8.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion the best way to find out about international news is on the internet
SI1267-00105-P50019 1 SI1267-00105  8.60 17.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's to get informed at the moment that the things happened wherever in the world
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105  0.00  5.16 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i partially agree because there are people who likes to read the newspaper on paper
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105  5.16 11.06 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it's true that we have to take into account the environment
SI1267-00105-P50020 1 SI1267-00105 11.06 18.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and it's better to stop printing that newspaper that you can see online
SI1267-00105-P50021 1 SI1267-00105  0.00 11.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i truly believe that social media is not reliable source of news because there are some people who tries to make fake news

SI1267-00115-P30017 1 SI1267-00115  0.00  7.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think doing job before the graduation is always good for a student

SI1267-00320-P30017 1 SI1267-00320 14.02 21.78 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main advantage obviously is the fact that you don't need to have your parents pay for your university

SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 18.21 29.76 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these acids particles are carried by wind which carry them to other zones other areas
SI1267-00487-P40018 1 SI1267-00487 29.76 34.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this acid particles mix with cloud water

SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616  0.00  3.61 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i have my mind up about it
SI1267-00616-P50021 1 SI1267-00616  3.61 19.60 <o,Q4,B1,P5> then i have an unshakeable belief that social media as a source of knowledge could be taken into positive and highly consideration
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616  0.00  5.71 <o,Q5,B1,P5> firstly we need to balance the pros and cons
SI1267-00616-P50023 1 SI1267-00616  5.71 17.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i got the answer right funnily enough there is not enough bad news at social media
SI1267-00619-P10005 1 SI1267-00619  0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm fascinated in learning other countries because i think it can not only expand my horizons but it will also caught with my interest
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619  0.00 13.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve my english is speaking like speaking with foreigners speaking with my classmates speaking with my teachers because speaking can really improve my english
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 13.79 16.88 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it can help me in writing and reading
SI1267-00619-P10007 1 SI1267-00619 16.88 18.92 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so speaking is important
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  9.95 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to learn how to drive a car because when i was a kid i'm dreamed of having my own car and drive it to wherever i like
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619  9.95 15.13 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if i can learn how drive a car i can do whatever we want
SI1267-00619-P10008 1 SI1267-00619 15.13 18.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and it's convenient to drive a car
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  3.55 <o,Q5,C,P3> well the advantages are clear
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  3.55  9.34 <o,Q5,C,P3> firstly they can earn some money to support their family and pay for their tuitions
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619  9.34 14.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> and secondly they can increase their experience of the society
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 14.28 16.84 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think there are also drawbacks
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 16.84 28.39 <o,Q5,C,P3> well firstly it is a great waste of time and energy and that will also cause them do bad in the academics part
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 28.39 35.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> but my own opinion is that i think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 35.21 47.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> because i think with adequate part time jobs you can adapted to the society and get used to it instead of studying in the university as a student
SI1267-00619-P30017 1 SI1267-00619 47.04 54.07 <o,Q5,C,P3> you can get a greater exposure to the university and society
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  6.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> factories and vehicles give off smoke and causes pollution
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619  6.84 12.65 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then acid particles are in the smoke and with the wind acid particles are carried by it
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 12.65 20.59 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and during this procedure some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with the cloud water
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 20.59 24.62 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then in the clouds the acid particles form rain and snow
SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 24.62 29.70 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and gradually it falls on the ground and cause damage to the environment

SI1267-00619-P40018 1 SI1267-00619 36.62 40.25 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this is the formation and effects of the acid rain
SI1267-00619-P50019 1 SI1267-00619  0.00  8.33 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you want to develop a good eating habit my suggestions is first and foremost you need a balanced diet

SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 12.94 25.68 <o,Q4,C,P4> the first and most important i think is that you have to travel to the airport via bus subway or a taxi cab
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 25.68 36.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to check in all your stuff with someone who will later travel your stuff into the airplane
SI127E-00329-P40018 1 SI127E-00329 36.09 45.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will have to show all your documents to officers and show your backpacks to security

SI127E-00535-P30017 1 SI127E-00535 21.88 30.21 <o,Q4,C,P3> and other advantages is that the student has this time to use your phone and do activities that don't serve for anything

SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647  0.00  8.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantage point is that they can get a chance to get job and money their own money
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647  8.23 17.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> this is very important because most of university student don't manage their pay for their university studies
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 17.98 20.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> so this is very important
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 20.22 30.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand disadvantage is that it takes a lot of time and energy to get job to pay for their university students
SI127E-00647-P30017 1 SI127E-00647 30.52 38.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in my opinion all university student need not to get a job to pay for their university studies

SI127E-00647-P50022 1 SI127E-00647  0.00 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion attending lecture is more effective than reading alone because by attending lecture you can get feedback from another people or something like teacher and this is very effective to learn or study

SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653  0.00  9.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> one important advantage of taking a job that will pay for university studies is that we don't have to take a credit
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653  9.14 20.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this is important because we will not find ourself limited by this credit and spend all the time following our study we'll have to pay for it
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 20.81 32.81 <o,Q4,C,P3> and a disadvantage of this idea is that sometimes we are distracted and we will not focus on our studies and will feel like we are wasting our time
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 32.81 38.91 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion i strongly believe that it depend of the courses or the master you choose
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 38.91 43.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you have enough time you can do a job at the same times
SI127E-00653-P30017 1 SI127E-00653 43.02 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> and however if you are really focused on your studies and you are concentrated and you don't have time at all so i recommend student to focus on their studies first and then pay for their universities studies by taking credit
SI127E-00653-P50019 1 SI127E-00653  0.00 15.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i strongly believe that technology have a great impact on studying because for example the different lecture can be recorded and student can see them another time and try to focus on what they don't understand by checking online

SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921  0.00  8.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> an argument favour that i would say here is in university you have to study a lot of things
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921  8.56 20.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and some books they are just in english or maybe in other language so it's important to know other language to read these books
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 20.54 36.83 <o,Q5,B2,P3> ones advantages i would say that not everyone have the opportunity to learn a language because not everyone can pay a course language
SI127E-00921-P30017 1 SI127E-00921 36.83 50.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion the government should give class in the university subjects

SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921  0.00  9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i totally agree because i think that nowadays everything is now digital
SI127E-00921-P50020 1 SI127E-00921  9.55 18.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so maybe now we already have newspapers on paper because of the old people the elderly

SI127E-00995-P10005 1 SI127E-00995 15.59 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i prefer going out with my friends
SI127E-00995-P10006 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 20.11 <o,Q5,B1,P1> for me it's something very important because you need watching the news maybe no all day but once per week because you must be informated about the things that occur your country
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 13.30 <o,Q5,B1,P1> well the most part of my time when i was child was with my friends in a park or maybe in the pool in the summer
SI127E-00995-P10007 1 SI127E-00995 13.30 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> and i adored playing with my friends all time
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  9.62 <o,Q5,B1,P1> obviously i hope to work in the job that i love that it's the lab
SI127E-00995-P10008 1 SI127E-00995  9.62 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> probably i will stayed in madrid because then there are a lot of opportunities of work
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 13.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for me it's very important to do the things that you will need to do in your future job
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 13.17 22.56 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and for this reason the include a period of practical work experience have a lot of advantages
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 22.56 51.18 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that its hasn't got disadvantages because the theoretical part is very important but the most important things always will be the practical skills and in these cases when you demonstrate the things that you have learnt
SI127E-00995-P30017 1 SI127E-00995 51.18 57.82 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for this reason is very essential to do practical work
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 11.62 <o,Q5,B1,P4> well we have studied visits to three news online pop music sites such as tunes net music now and song for you
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 11.62 32.07 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the most remarkable thing that we can watch in this graphic is that since the five day both in music now visits and so for you visits has decreased
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 32.07 37.94 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and for contrast in the tunes net the visits has increase
SI127E-00995-P40018 1 SI127E-00995 37.94 57.65 <o,Q5,B1,P4> for to sum up although tunes net have start with low visits it has finished with height visits
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  8.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> obviously you can have mates who doesn't think like you
SI127E-00995-P50020 1 SI127E-00995  8.38 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and probably you must or you want to work in a form that other people don't like
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995  0.00  8.01 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think so because obviously all people must have the ability of think by self
SI127E-00995-P50021 1 SI127E-00995  8.01 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and if you want that everyone think the same obviously can be worse to individual person
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995  0.00 10.46 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i don't think so because i think that you can have a good team without have face to face teams
SI127E-00995-P50022 1 SI127E-00995 10.46 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that the key is collaborate each other and be friends too

SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525  9.53 16.71 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and with adapt i mean that they will become online newspapers as it is happening right now
SI127E-01525-P50020 1 SI127E-01525 16.71 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this could be a reason of not disappearing

SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809  0.00 13.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> i believe there is a whole raft of arguments in favour of learning a foreign language to pass their university course
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 13.37 26.96 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think it is really important for you to get to know a different language so you can travel the world and learn different cultures and immerse in different cultures
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 26.96 34.80 <o,Q5,C,P3> plus you probably can find a job somewhere else where they do not speak the same language as you do
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 34.80 45.05 <o,Q5,C,P3> the main disadvantage may be probably that it takes time to learn a different language
SI127E-01809-P30017 1 SI127E-01809 45.05 57.77 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in my point of view i think it is really necessary to give it a shot and learn a different language and get out of our comfort zone

SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102  8.08 22.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the advantages of this are that you know more languages and you are more capable of finding a job and can travel go to work abroad
SI128D-00102-P30017 1 SI128D-00102 22.73 34.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage are that they have less time to study your university subject

SI12BD-00657-P10008 1 SI12BD-00657  6.14 17.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so knowing how to speak english would open us a lot of doors at the market

SI12BD-00657-P30017 1 SI12BD-00657 32.05 48.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the main disadvantage is that in most of cases at university people live in a very busy style with a lot of works with a lot of exam so it could affect to their marks

SI12BD-00657-P50021 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that social media is a reliable source because you can argue your posts with image and videos to give more credibility to your speech
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657  0.00 17.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that local news are the most important for us because we need to know what's happening near us to know what is going to happen at the future and what is going to happen on the world
SI12BD-00657-P50022 1 SI12BD-00657 17.80 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00  1.86 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i love music
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665  1.86 11.63 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i think that is my passion and is the most important thing for me because in the future maybe i will be a musician
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 11.63 15.25 <o,Q3,B2,P1> i can play the piano and the guitar
SI12BD-00665-P10005 1 SI12BD-00665 15.25 19.86 <o,Q3,B2,P1> and really is my passion music
SI12BD-00665-P10006 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> travel is my favourite thing in the world because if you want to know different places you need to travel around the country
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00  7.05 <o,Q4,B2,P3> currently speaking a language other than yours is of almost importance
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665  7.05 12.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> at universities students must meet a certain level of english to graduate
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 12.54 24.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first the advantage of knowing another language are getting better job opportunities meeting people for the other countries and being able to communicate with them
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 24.80 35.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> learn about the culture of other countries it's another one advantage for this skill
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 35.84 43.84 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantage are that it is very exhausting to learn another language because you have to study a lot
SI12BD-00665-P30017 1 SI12BD-00665 43.84 55.74 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion learn another language is a way to open new horizons in your work life and it also helps you understand other cultures

SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665  0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think that's the case because newspapers are traditional means of communication specially for older people
SI12BD-00665-P50020 1 SI12BD-00665 10.04 15.64 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however i believe that social media provides immediately information

SI12BD-00665-P50023 1 SI12BD-00665  3.71  6.96 <o,Q3,B2,P5> bad news in the media is a very serious problem

SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691  0.00 24.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> on one hand i think it will be essential to learn a foreign language to pass your university course because you're gonna need it for your future career in order to have an employment in any area in which you wanna work
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 24.21 35.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> because nowadays all human resources responsibles ask for a english title or a french title or something like that
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 35.75 44.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think the disadvantage of this on the other hand is that it's gonna take time from your course
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 44.15 56.58 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you're gonna have to spend time studying a language that it adds to the time you're spending learning your courses
SI12BD-00691-P30017 1 SI12BD-00691 56.58 59.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion this is essential

SI12BD-00691-P50021 1 SI12BD-00691 11.96 19.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> but if you follow the news outlets like that are prestigious you wouldn't have any problem
SI12BD-00691-P50022 1 SI12BD-00691  0.00 18.54 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my own personal view i don't think it's that important to be up to date on local news because now with the globalisation everything that happens in another part of the world can affect you

SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149  0.00  6.94 <o,Q4,C,P3> well learning a foreign language has advantages and disadvantages
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149  6.94 19.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> and firstly the advantages are that student will get better jobs in the future coz they speak two language
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 19.56 28.90 <o,Q4,C,P3> also they will develop skills like speaking and thinking
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 28.90 42.74 <o,Q4,C,P3> however the disadvantages they might not be able to concentrate on more essential courses coz learning a foreign language is very difficult
SI131R-00149-P30017 1 SI131R-00149 42.74 59.36 <o,Q4,C,P3> overall in my opinion student should to choose if they want it or not coz they shouldn't be forced to learn a foreign language
SI131R-00149-P50020 1 SI131R-00149  0.00 16.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes of course coz you know the climate change is a big issue and one way to reduce the pollution by reducing the paper

SI131R-00149-P50022 1 SI131R-00149  0.00 12.37 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so currently people don't read the newspaper so the most effective way it's by your phone you know
SI131R-00149-P50022 1 SI131R-00149 12.37 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can just download the app so you can keep up with the news
SI131R-00149-P50023 1 SI131R-00149  0.00 13.84 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion they are right coz they just exaggerate the news so they make it worse than it it is in the real life
SI131R-00149-P50023 1 SI131R-00149 13.84 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> also bad news get a lot of attention so people just focus on the bad news

SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156  7.59 20.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and when they start to work in a new job they can find job for example in the restaurants or hotels or teacher

SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 26.76 29.13 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but there are some disadvantage
SI131R-00156-P30017 1 SI131R-00156 29.13 37.36 <o,Q4,B1,P3> for example they are going to have less time for study other languages like biologist maths

SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172  0.00 29.47 <o,Q4,C,P3> one advantage to study a foreign language to pass your university course is that you are forced to learn another way of speaking and yeah it opens your mind on the world and it allows you to speak to other people to discover our cultures other mindset
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 29.47 32.97 <o,Q4,C,P3> so i think it's a big advantage
SI131R-00172-P30017 1 SI131R-00172 32.97 49.69 <o,Q4,C,P3> one disadvantage could be yeah the forced aspect well the fact that it is required so there is a contraint that can be a little bit stressful

SI131R-00172-P50023 1 SI131R-00172  9.81 15.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so if we just don't look at those problems there will never be solved and there will be worsened

SI131R-00200-P10008 1 SI131R-00200  7.58 13.74 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so if my spoken english is very poor i will be have some negative impact on our study

SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200  0.00  4.77 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well from this question i would say there are some advantages about that
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200  4.77 14.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example it will strengthen our ability to learn from new things and that will give us a sense of achievement and fulfilment
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 14.76 18.03 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and what's more there are some disadvantages as well
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 18.03 30.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for example if we are too tired and we are overwhelmed about our study that we major in so we can't spend more time on another things for example to learn another language
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 30.91 39.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if we spend too much time on learning about another languages and that we can't concentrate on the study that we major in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 39.00 42.18 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is just keep a good balance
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 42.18 48.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it depends if you are too tired with your study work so you don't have to attend a foreign language class
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 48.83 52.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you just need to concentrate yourself on the study that you are major in
SI131R-00200-P30017 1 SI131R-00200 52.70 57.48 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and everyone should be flexible about their opinion they made
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200  0.00  6.08 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the best way for me to understand the international news is by searching online
SI131R-00200-P50019 1 SI131R-00200  6.08 18.58 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example we can use the b b c or the v o a to read some news online and then we can have a better understanding of what is happening on the world
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200  0.00 15.02 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i am not fully agree with this idea but i think the newspaper will be on decrease because with the development of the technogic so we always watch some news on our phones instead of watch newspaper
SI131R-00200-P50020 1 SI131R-00200 15.02 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so in that way the number of newspaper will be on a decrease

SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 30.17 46.66 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disvantage for me is the level or the difficulty because study a language is not easy and you need take more time to study
SI131R-00209-P30017 1 SI131R-00209 46.66 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion if you have the opportunity to learn a foreign languages try to do it because it will be better for our future

SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490  0.00  8.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> nowadays many students are required to study at least one foreign language in their university studying plan
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490  8.31 11.43 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think there are many advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 11.43 22.54 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first of all students who study at least one foreign language such as english can communicate with the native english speaker better
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 22.54 33.80 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and nowadays most of the paperworks are written in english so if they want to deepen their understanding of these academic papers they need to learn english
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 33.80 42.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but for many students that won't talk with this foreigners for a long time it will just waste the time
SI137O-00490-P30017 1 SI137O-00490 42.71 49.95 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in conclusion i think it's necessary to study at least one foreign language coz china is become a more and more international country now
SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490  0.00 14.38 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with this point but i think it may takes a long time to finish this because many people likes to read the news on the newspaper and they don't know how to use the internet
SI137O-00490-P50020 1 SI137O-00490 14.38 20.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> but the media has been more convenient nowadays

SI137O-00596-P10005 1 SI137O-00596  9.32 13.75 <o,Q5,C,P1> i enjoy for example listening to it with my friends
SI137O-00596-P10005 1 SI137O-00596 13.75 19.26 <o,Q5,C,P1> or yeah just a lot of genres a lot of bands

SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596  2.81 13.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have done it a lot with my parents with friends where for example in the summer i go to colombia and travel with friends
SI137O-00596-P10006 1 SI137O-00596 13.46 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example we go to a friend's house in the mountains and it's pretty cool
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  3.74 <o,Q5,C,P1> well speaking english is always an advantage
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596  3.74 11.68 <o,Q5,C,P1> you can communicate with a lot of people from different countries because the language is so international
SI137O-00596-P10008 1 SI137O-00596 11.68 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example with some friends who don't speak either german or spanish i can communicate with them through english
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  8.85 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think it helps students like stimulate another part of the brain
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596  8.85 22.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> mostly if you're just studying like a scientific career like in my case your exercises and activities are pretty much the same through the whole career
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 22.91 26.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> a lot of monotony and pretty homogeneous
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 26.89 38.88 <o,Q5,C,P3> and if you have to study at least one foreign language you will have to develop other abilities that don't come from your career
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 38.88 42.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think it could have advantages
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 42.30 48.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> disadvantage is it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice and you really don't have that much time
SI137O-00596-P30017 1 SI137O-00596 48.82 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> so i think maybe english is ok because it really is helpful in your life but other languages it's maybe not that important
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596  0.00  8.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well with the new technologies probably like follow some instagram pages of news that are from other countries
SI137O-00596-P50019 1 SI137O-00596  8.88 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and if you're really interested and you really get to search every day for news then you can do it that way
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596  0.00 10.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> well maybe not newspapers as we know them now in that physical form but i think in the digital form they will have a lot of impact
SI137O-00596-P50020 1 SI137O-00596 10.88 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and with that much misinformation going on it's really important to have reliable source

SI137O-01016-P10008 1 SI137O-01016  9.77 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so learning english is a skill that everybody will need in the future and for sure it would help me to find new jobs
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016  0.00 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in spain the country i live in it is mandatory to study one foreigns language or to have a b 0ne level in a foreigns language to pass the university course
SI137O-01016-P30017 1 SI137O-01016 16.38 30.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i think it's totally fair since you will need to learn for example english or another foreign language in your future jobs

SI137O-01016-P50019 1 SI137O-01016  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> the best way for students to find about international news is to search on the internet the main newspapers that covers internationals main events for example times the new york times or the b b c
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  5.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> well the future of the newspaper is not well known
SI137O-01016-P50020 1 SI137O-01016  5.83 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> however what i think is that the newspaper in paper will disappear however the newspaper the online web newspaper will remain active
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016  0.00  6.62 <o,Q4,C,P5> as i see it social media is not a reliable source of news at all
SI137O-01016-P50021 1 SI137O-01016  6.62 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> social media is a place where people post how they want to look how they want their lives to look and where fake news are everywhere

SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016  6.29 15.83 <o,Q4,C,P5> however it is obvious that we will focus on bad news and those bad news are the one that we will remember the most
SI137O-01016-P50023 1 SI137O-01016 15.83 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> and also it's important to show that the world is not a good place
