SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 14.10 37.78 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think that schools and colleges should make time in the school day to practice some exercises and to promote a more healthy lifestyle because it can help to fight both physical and mental health problems
SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 37.78 54.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as study time or for learning some other things

SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045  0.00 11.76 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the best thing about studying in a second language is that you can put it in your resume
SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 11.76 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time it is a very valuable thing that enterprises value
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  0.00  6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of constraints when you're studying in another country
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  6.79 16.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all you have to learn a new language and speak a new language or your second language

SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045  0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything on your own
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 11.12 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you don't do when you live at home

SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206  0.00  7.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am not sure but one possibility is as a teacher

SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206  0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what life is and at the same time you are studying of course
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 15.50 28.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that maybe you are too busy working and studying at the same time so you can get a little stressed
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 28.71 35.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and this isn't a good thing for your health
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 35.86 43.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that it's a good idea to do both things at the same time working and studying
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 43.56 57.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because working you can learn a lot of things that you can't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you can't learn while working
