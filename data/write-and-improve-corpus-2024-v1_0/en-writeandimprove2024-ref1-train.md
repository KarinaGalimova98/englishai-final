A new year is always an invitation to establish goals for the next 365 days. There are some areas that I'm pleased with, like my knowledge of languages, writing, speaking, and presenting scientific articles. There are also areas that I should improve, like statistics, AI, algorithms, and how to present a project I have developed. So I need to have some strategies for achieving goals. 1 - Improving a new language: I need to study, daily, at least a little time like 15 minutes. And this study includes writing and reading a lot. 2 - Presenting scientific articles: it's important to reach innovative findings, read, study, and try to disseminate these new ideas. To consider myself a presenter I need to study a lot. 3 - Improving my knowledge of statistics: a challenge, but not impossible. So as to achieve the previous goals, I'll need to study systematically and never give up. 4 - Understanding about algorithms - it's a new kind of knowledge and very difficult to study for someone who is not a specialist in this area, but I think that if I am persistent, I will learn. There are so many challenges, but if I meet all my goals it will contribute to my happiness, of course.

Hello my English friend, My favourite film at the moment is Star Wars The rise of Skywalker. I saw it on Monday in the cinema. I was with my two sons. They also liked the film very much. The film is one of three (a trilogy) and it is the last film of nine films. It is science fiction. In the last film the main person of the film must destroy the evil empire of the Sith. I think you will probably like this film. Mario

There are people who say it doesn't matter how long you live, but how you spend your life. So, for them, the quality of life is something that really matters. It would be hard to deny it, but, on the other hand, our desire to live is so strong and obvious that we are eager to extend our life span every possible way. In the first place, there are a lot of advantages of leading a peaceful and long life. The longer you live, the more chances there are to share your time with your loved ones, such as friends and family. Each day has its unique importance and beauty. People have opportunities to learn something new day in day out, which makes life purposeful and meaningful. But other people are eager to push their limits and try whatever possible in their lives. They appoint some goals for themselves and feel the tremor of excitement when they try to achieve them. These range from simple things such as picking up new skills to extremely dangerous sports such as caving or bungee jumping. For example, they want to see the ocean, drown in it and learn how to dive in its deep water. They feel in their heart of hearts that only if they accomplish it, they will truly be fulfilled and exhilarated. Such people would like to live fully instead of a dull and tedious life without risky and adventurous situations. If I had to choose, I would go for a mediocre but longer life rather than a spectacular but shorter one. I would like to enjoy life and people I love day by day for a long time, taking advantage of each single joy.

I live in a small city in the Netherlands called Goes. Goas has a small museum. In this museum you can find information about the water disaster. This disaster occurred in 1945. Goes is a very beautiful city and there are very important landmarks around the city. One of the famous landmarks you can find here is the Delta work. This is a series of constructions, built in 1945 after the water disaster. These constructions protect the city and other cities in the region from the water.

Hi Billal, Last week I went on a trip with some students from my class. We went to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is one of the most beautiful museums in the Netherlands. They were all very excited by the paintings from the 17th century. They enjoyed it very much because of the main painting "De Nachtwacht," painted by Rembrand van Rijn. There were also paintings from other masters, such as Vincent van Gogh and Pieter Paul Rubens, Vermeer and so on.

This year, I really want to improve my English skills. In particular, I want to improve my speaking ability and my writing. How would I like to improve this? I'd like to spend more time on reading and writing to improve my grammar. I find grammar very difficult to remember, but I'll not give up. I'm really pleased listening to English podcasts on Spotify and watching movies on Netflix and YouTube. In my opinion, it offers contact with real English, I mean the accent and pronunciation. I know that the only way to improve speaking and writing is to learn more using different methods. I'd like to continue my online lessons with native speakers, which is a good opportunity to improve my speaking and helps my self-confidence. I also want to spend more time on reading texts and doing grammar exercise. Let me know what you think about my strategy of improving English in the upcoming year, please.

What's the future of travel? Nowadays, people can travel around the world almost without any limits. During the last 100 years, people have changed the way they travel. Even our grandparents spent days or weeks travelling between continents. Ships were the fastest mode of travelling. Then airlines started to offer their services and now we can fly in 24 hours around the globe. People are trying to developed new ways of transport to minimise the length of travel. On the other hand, we are looking beyond the horizon of the globe, we are interested in travelling into space. There are two companies which work to make travelling in space more accessible. There is a big chance that in the short-term future people will start travelling into space. At the beginning, it could cost a fortune for ordinary people, but it will change when more companies will developed their technology and services. It will still be that we move from one place to another, but we will use different modes of transport. Maybe we will sleep during the trip to minimise the effects of travelling in space because we still don't know the impact on our body and mind when travelling in space.

First, I would like to say thank you for requesting me to write this article in this amazing magazine. As you already know, I will write about "The School Of The Future." I will especially write about in what ways I think schools will be different in the future and in what ways they might still be the same. I think schools will be different in the future as regards accepting ICT equipment, such as projectors, sound boxes, and so on. I think by using this equipment school will be very efficient and both students and teachers will be able to facilitate their classes very smoothly in the future. On the other hand, schools will still be the same as regards offering school lunches. I believe that we need a school lunch dietitian to ensure students' individual health. School lunch dieticians should also keep a good hygiene during school lunch time. I think a good hygiene is very important when it comes to ensuring students' individual health. Plus, school lunch time should be a lot of fun! I think we need some nice topics to talk about and we need a lot of laughter during lunch time! It must be a lot of fun for students! I like schools today, but I believe that future schools will be better and better by having a great balance between accepting new technology and maintaining the old schools' tradition.

My best holiday ever. A couple of years ago, I went with my family for a summer holiday. We booked a trip in a German office for a two-week stay on a Spanish island. We started our trip in Dresden, where we entered a plane and after a three-hour flight we arrived at the airport in Palma, the capital city of Mallorca. We stayed in a three-star hotel close to the beach. We enjoyed delicious food in local, traditional restaurants. We spent a wonderful time travelling across the island. Mallorca is not a big island, so tourists have an opportunity to visit almost every corner of this amazing place. We enjoyed sunbathing in the evening when the temperature had fallen. Travelling by car, we had a chance to stop in every place we wanted. In my opinion, everyone will find something interesting to see. I really recommend e.g. Closter, the colorful harbours, beautiful small bays, caves, and mountains. I do believe that due to many interesting places, the tasty food, nice weather conditions, and friendly people this was our best holiday ever.

I need practice, the practical process is the most important to be good at any language. Beside that, I must find a new environment where I can use it daily.

---"Television entertains, but can it also educate?"--- If I were to answer this question, I would say "Yes.." I have a reason to support this statement. Firstly, I of course agree that television entertains by showing audiences variety shows, quiz shows, comedy shows, and so on. Usually, this kind of TV shows are very popular among kids and teenagers. In fact, I also enjoy watching these types of TV shows. I laugh a lot, or sometimes, I even cry because I feel impressed or I am moved. Moreover, TV can also educate by broadcasting recent news, science, social studies, and so on. Of course, learning something in school and learning something from workbooks is also important, but I think TV shows will also be part of education. On TV, you can learn things that can't be taught in school, and they can sometimes be very educational for kids like us. In conclusion, I think that we should live well with mass media like television, and I believe that will lead us to a better life in the future.

Money can't buy happiness or serenity. It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. I am in total agreement with that. Health can't be replaced by anything. There are a lot of rich people who are ready to give up their wealth just to become healthy. Some illnesses cannot be cured even with all the money in the world. Sick people have to go through pain and the fear of losing their life. They wish there was anything to do to help them. I remember one of my dad's friends had a rare disease. He travelled around the world and spent all of his money just to find a cure. But sadly he died after a tragic journey of trying to find the medication. Eventually, I learned from that situation that health is the most important thing in life . Besides, it is a gift from God that deserves to be grateful for.

In my opinion, television lost its educational role to entertainment. Since TV has become a cash cow for advertisers we watch more ads than valuable television productions. People watch more low-quality television series and reality shows instead of educational programs. People become lazy; we are busy and overworked and we expect more fun and joy. Solid productions are less popular than shows and soap operas. I think the reason is only money. A more valuable production costs more and demands more commitment. Only a few TV stations try to go the extra mile and create highly valuable productions. I am really concerned about the fact that TV has changed in this way, but we should remember that even the world has changed too and event TV has adapted to the market. Every country has a government TV station and in my opinion governments should use this medium to educate citizen. The smarter people we are, the fewer worries we have.

It's a very good subject. What trips will be like in the future. I am not good at wondering about the future, but I think travelling will be easier because we are going to have many sorts of transportation. In the future, maybe there will be flying cars or automated vehicles. As drivers will not be necessary, everyone will be passengers and enjoy the trip more. The most important thing will be the security. Without any war we will be able to travel in peace. People, especially women, will be respected, so to travel alone will not be dangerous. Airplanes will be able to fly longer and distances between places will be nearer in time. That means, trips will be less distressful and tiresome. Probably space travel will be available. So we will have some travellers to the Moon or other planets and we will come back safely. On these trips we will admire the stars and the sun. We will have another point of view of our solar system and be astonished with our big blue earth.

Computers and tablets will completely replace books in schools and universities. Because we are in the age of technology and ethernet. When technology improves, people are going to use every area of technology in their lives. In my opinion, books are the most important things in our life. If you want to learn anything, you should read a lot of books. Using computers or tablets instead of books will be very expensive for some countries. When students are going to schools or universities, using books for teaching process. For education not only use a computer or tablet. Every tool should be used at the same time. Books, computers, tablets, ethernet, etc. This is useful for students. This is a methodology for teaching. Books and technology are not separate from each other. This is impossible. The new generations are reading a lot of books and at the same time using the latest technological instruments.

In this century, a mobile phone has become an indispensable part of our personal and professional life. We use it to connect and communicate with our loved one, clients, boss and other people around us. And with a smartphone, some people use it for a business purpose. Young millionaires have been using mobile phones to create customer engagement and sell products worth more than million. Many employees also use it as a main tool for working remotely. Banning mobile phone usage in public spaces will interrupt a main channel for communication respectively and cause a massive inconvenience. However, using mobile phones in public spaces can trigger several joint problems. In some spaces, like libraries and movie theaters, a mobile phone ringtone and blue light can disturb people nearby and ruin the serene environment of the space. Having long and loud conversations via mobiles on public transportation disrupts the peace of the journey and distracts others' concentration. And the loud noise can spread negative emotions. Another drawback of using a mobile phone in public spaces, especially in government services and hospitals, is that it annoys professional officers who are focusing and doing their job. In my opinion, instead of imposing bans, the town council should allow people to use mobile phones with some restrictions and encourage people to use mobile phones and other electronic equipment with consideration for others.

Each class and club does various things such as staging a drama or selling some food. For example, I make some reports and show the planetarium as a member of an astronomy club. Surprisingly, we prepare almost all things by ourselves. I’ve been learning the Japanese tea ceremony at my school, and I made Japanese green tea in front of the guests in the school festival last year. Though I was very nervous, I could please the guests. Second, I like to see the autumn leaves. I think yellow, red, and brown leaves are one of the most beautiful things in nature.

It's a debatable issue whether one opts for a calm life, where they are following the same routine every day, or an intense life full of excitement and challenges. I personally believe that life should be challenging and deep enough so that we can be remembered by all other people till the time when life exists in the universe. To embark with, an intense life has its certain benefits. The one most common one is that such a life teaches you new and different skills required to solve issues, further boosting your confidence level and making you famous. To illustrate this, the famous scientist Einstin belonged to a small village and accepted the challenge and invented the bulb which further made him a famous scientist, who is still remembered by all of us. Secondly, such a life is more happening and lively to live till the end, as compared to a calm and steady life which is good for an initial time but after some time you easily get bored with such a life as we are following the same routine for many years. For example, a recent survey conducted by The Times newspaper shows that people living in hilly areas are those who are doing the same kind of work and do not have any excitement for life as compared to city people. To sum up, it's only the intense quality of life which helps an individual to learn new methods and techniques, further boosting their confidence level to accept new challenges in life and making them famous personalities.

It is like the Internet. We humans choose on our own. If it educate them or not. It depends on its users, interests, and his cooperation to engage with it. It sure isn't like teachers teaching at school. So it educates you in your interest and desire. The question shouldn't be, "Television entertains, but can it also educate?," it should be, " How good is television to learn stuff?" Maybe ask as well if it's useful. From my perspective, I can say I have actually learned some stuff from television. Like recently, it has opened me. The idea to request a burger at MacDonald's and put in some fries. Just for the knowledge of, how it will taste. I mean I wouldn't have gotten this idea by myself. Also, documentaries can educate you quite well and in maybe more useful topics. Even so, I would suggest have a notebook by your side, so you can note down interesting information.

English is a global language. That's why millions of people are learning it every day. In my particular opinion, I decided to learn English when I was a teenager because a lot of my favourite programmes were in English. After I started with my English lessons, I realized that English was easy for me and each time I got more interested in it. A couple of years later when I graduated from high school I started to study English as a major and I realized even more that English is an important and interesting language to learn. English in my opinion is important because thanks to it I have learned a lot. I also think that I found something when I'm good but the most important, I expanded my dreams and goals to achieve. I'm creating new opportunities for me because English is a wonderful language and it gives me the opportunity to grow as a person and future professional doing something that I love and also doing different projects in my life.

How we travel will certainly change in the future, and now I'm going to tell you what my opinion is. I think cars will no longer work with petrol: the pollution level will not let it be possible. In my opinion, cars will be charged with electricity. In fact, nowadays, scientists have begun doing research into this topic and the first prototypes have already been made. I also think that cars and buses will have an automatic driver. I think that this is a negative thing as lots of people will lose their work because of that. I think trains and aeroplanes will be faster. In my opinion, scientists will soon develop a prototype which is able to go from London to New York in a very short time. Around Europe there already are some trains that go at high speed. I think there will be devices on ships that consent not to do accident and there will be more comfort present on cruise ships. Moving from one isle to another will be easier and will take less time because of better ferries.

In this decade, we ran into many innovations that were improved by technology. Many of them are used easily by people because the producers of those products have been providing new models every year, such as computers, tablets, or smartphones. People get used to these devices and use them their whole lives. Hence companies increase their sales figures. Everyone is grateful for technology and they do not want to turn back to old techniques like books, magazines, or newspapers. For example, nowadays children prefer computers, tablets, or the internet to learn something. So that situation reminds us of the question, “ Should computers and tablets replace books in educational areas of study? ” In general, technology has a lot of magnificent benefits. If we talk about educational situations, it has even more benefits. For instance, tablets and e-readers are very useful for students because you can take notes of anything without a pen. It stores as much information as 3 or 4 libraries do. Simple, quick, and useful. Furthermore, using that product is a good way to prevent deforestation because every year many trees are cut down to publish books. On the other hand, many scientists suggest that books are a good guide to learning because when you look up any information but you can not see it quickly review, you have to keep scanning until you find it. So, you have more chance to memorize it after you finish your search. In my opinion, both sides have good benefits, but I support the idea that books should still be in schools and universities.

Hi neighbour, I shall give you a key of the house so you can always enter while we are on vacation. There are some plants which need water once a week. We have got pets like fish, guinea pigs and parakeets. Feed them every day in the morning. The fish need only dry food. The guinea pigs need fresh water and kibble. The parakeets need seed. You can find the seed in the plastic bowl. Would you like to get the mail in the mailbox? Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone, First, I just want to introduce myself. My name is Ali, I am twenty years old and I am a student at the Syrian Virtual University and I study an information engineering major . So let us start . The Future of Travel; I think travel in the future will be very different from before. It will be faster than before because we are in a world that has a lot of changes . In the future, we can travel virtually like in virtual reality. By imagining climbing a mountain or going through a forest we can overlay different stories and experiences of that . Imagine going to Vegas in the year 2050, it is an experiences you think is real. So the technology will interact and change many things of our experience without having an impact on the environment and inform us more about that experience and what we are about to see and do. without having an impact on the environment and informs us more about that experience and what we are about to see and to do. will be different in many things, like in fast and in modern travel .

Books and technology I am a music teacher. I work at a small school. All the students receive their music notes in paper form. But the newest trend is to work with a tablet. We do not need paper and this is good for the environment. At the moment, my biggest job is to scan all the music notes that I need. My tablet is very good, but I have to learn to use it. The biggest question is, "What is the easiest way to find my grades on the computer?." only I have a computer, the students do not have one. Also, a problem is that not all schools have Wi-Fi to send a message to print what I need. At the moment, this is the future for me. Primary schools have the facilities and the students learn early to work with a computer. I see the problem is not at school but at home! The children are often alone at home and they do not only work for the school on the computer; the temptation is to surf on the internet. We all know what happens next.

Dear Charlie, Today, I'm writing this email to tell you about my favorite film. My favorite film is "The Sound of Music" starring Julie Andrews. Because I'm a music lover, I like this movie very much. It has lots of singing, dancing, and most importantly, the actors' acting skills are very high and they're very talented. I was impressed by that. As a music lover, I watch it over and over again, even now. I think it's one of the best movies and it won so many awards, including Oscars, Golden Globes and so on. I remembered that you also like music like me, so I'm sure that you are going to like the movie very much. Watch the movie whenever you can, and give me a comment on the movie in the reply. I'm looking forward to it. Can't wait to hear your comments!

My favourite film is "The hate you give." The film is about a young black man who got shot by a white cop without any reason. The white cop shot him because he thought that the young black man had a gun, but it was only a cump. When all this happened, there was a young black girl with him and she saw all of this injustice. But after all that happened the cop didn't get a clean bill of health because he only shot a black man. Then the girl stood up for the right of the dark skins and sought justice for her friend who had been shot. I love that film because it shows real life and injustice. It is a real story and very significant and I think people can learn from the film.

Do you ever imagine the school of the future? Schools in the future will certainly be different from the school of nowadays. What will they be like? Will they be better or worse than now? Firstly, I believe that new schools will be more digital. Pupils will study on computers and teachers will work with videos and other digital devices. I think that this will have a positive effect. The positive effect is that students will have fun while learning. There won't be any homework. This will be very good as students will have more time available for their hobbies and to do what they want. Teenagers will also be able to get a little job, in order to earn some money. I would be very glad about that because teens would be able to work and study at the same time. Moreover, I think that students won't only study traditional subjects . This will be nice because pupils who aren't keen on studying will have the possibility to learn something else. I hope that school will improve in the best way.

--- MY REASONS FOR LEARNING ENGLISH --- By the School Newspaper Hi everyone, How are you? Today, we are writing in this school newspaper to report the result of a questionnaire. We asked other students the following question. What is the biggest reason to study English? Many respondents answered, "To make my life fruitful." 65% Some said they learn English, "To expand their field of activity." 25% Others said, "Now we're living in the 21st century and its society of globalization, it will surely come in handy in the near future." 5% The rest of the students had a different opinion. (Other) 5% From this questionnaire, we can see that different people had a different opinion. I think that's good. We must accept each other's opinion. In my case, I'm studying English because I have a certain aim that I want to achieve in the future. I strongly believe in saying "Hard work does pay off." I am going to study English hard, and I hope that I will be able to achieve my goal in the near future.

I always feel that the new school year will be better than the one before. I hope to be better in the subjects that I am not really good at. Most students have favorite subjects. My favorite subjects are math, English, and Arabic. Now, I am thinking of changing my way of studying, like solving more menistery books or taking more lessons in the subjects that I am not really good at. I could also search on the internet for videos that explain the difficult lessons. Another way is to write a summary of each lesson. I may also have a partner for studying, this will be interesting and it will be useful for both of us. This is useful because of collecting ideas and information. There are some subjects that are not my preferred ones, like French and social studies. I want to be more clever and I hope that I will become the first again.

Hi, I think in the future school will be different because in the future everything will be able to change . So school will be changed in many ways. It will be different in the learning and in the things that schools use, like the books and notebooks will maybe change to a smart device. And the whiteboard will be a smart whiteboard, and the markers maybe will be changed chaenged to touch and the school bags will be lighter for children, and the subjects of the school will be different in many ways, and this will develop the learning environment of the future. Learning will be smarter and more smart and the food in the school will be healthier, and the school will let the student think like a computer, and the subjects will make the students smarter, and the students will have smart exercises to make them smarter.

In this article I will tell people how the future of travel could change. In fact, I think that cars will be able to fly and they don't need a driver, because the cars will have a computer that will speak to them and will tell them where they will have to go. At the same time, travel will be the same because people like going around the world with their friends and also like visiting a historical city with an old castle and an amazing square and meeting people. In the future, if you wanted to, you could go to the moon and spend a few days with an astronaut and eat lyophilized food. But at the same time you could go to a typical restaurant where the cook will make you her special dishes and she could help you to cook with her. I hope that this article looks smart to you and that it will win the prize. Thank you because you had to read it.

It is often said that health is wealth and we should give it more importance than money. I agree with the statement because healthy people can live independently. However, I believe that money is equally important to live a healthy life. Some people believe that healthy people are less dependent on their family. It allows people to concentrate on work and quickly learn new things. Nowadays, big firms prefer to hire people with new skills and good health. This helps them earn money for a longer time. In this way they save money for later and use it wisely. For instance, a report from 2012 at Oxford university found that healthier people learn 5 times faster than the people who cannot concentrate. Therefore, health must be taken seriously. I think money plays a vital role in keeping you healthy. People can buy organic food which is healthier but costly. They are less prone to most of the diseases born from food items and stay healthy for a longer time. For example, a survey, in India, found that 90% of the rich people eat food items grown on their farms organically. To sum up, for health it is important to be rich. We should not ignore money.

My favourite film Hi Sylvi, Yesterday evening, I was watching the movie: "A Beautiful Mind." It was not the first time. I have seen the film three times. The best about this film is that it is the truth. When I saw it the first time I did not understand everything, but every time I understand it better. The story tells us about a young man at university. He has a very good friend, but in reality he does not exist. You need a long time to detect that he is schizophrenic. But the life means good with him. He has a wonderful wife and with her help he quits university and is appointed professor. The highest point was the Nobel Prize in mathematics for him.

My best holiday ever was on December 3-4, 2019. I went with my family to Barcelo Montelimar Beach, which is an all-inclusive three-star hotel. It is located on Montelimar Beach at Nicaragua's Pacific Coast. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday. My husband and me decided to not celebrate with a children's party because it is more stressful for me, so I wanted to rest and enjoy a vacation. The hotel has 4 pools, one of them is the biggest pool in Central America. Also, the hotel has a pool just for children from 0 to 8 years old. It was fantastic for my daughter, who is only 5 years old, but then she got bored. My son enjoyed eating many fried potatoes and hot dogs a lot because I usually don't allow him to eat junk food. Also, he swam in the pool all day long and played baseball with his father on the beach. Also, we had fun as a family in the restaurants and talent show activities where my daughter danced with clowns.

I liked this trip because it was the first time that I visited France. But this trip also had a negative side. The transport that the school had arranged was a bus, as you know I get travel sickness so I had to vomit. this, I can say that I enjoyed this trip. Would I like to go back to Paris? I will definitely say yes. I'm learning English because I want to pursue my dream. I would like to follow a master, and to apply for a master your English level must be at least level C. Pursue means try to achieve something, it could be study, sport or work. I need to choose whether I want to follow an English course in the summer or not. There is another word that I can't distinguish if I 'm reading a text, namely, persuade. The definition of persuade according to the Cambridge dictionary is do or believe something, for example, if she doesn't want to go on holiday, there is nothing that you can do to persuade her.

Today, I introduce my study strategy for writing in English. The way I do it is by using a free site on the internet. More specifically, I usually use the site "Write&Improve." It offers us a place to practice. With the site we can type an essay and submit it and receive a score like a real TOEFL test. I partly like this way of studying because you can study for free if you have a PC and connect to the internet. But I don't like this way because it was too harsh to continue for me, since I am very lazy. Of course, I want to play and drink with my friend. But if you really seriously think about a way of studying, I undoubtedly recommend it. Because the structure is very sophisticated, it leads you to the next level and you will be good at English if you try very hard. If you decide to try it, please inform me. I will give you an introduction. Thank you.

What I want to achieve in this year is to get a score of 100 at the TOEFL test. To achieve my goal, I have to enhance my reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills. Especially the speaking skills are my weak point. So I have to improve my speaking skills. Luckily, I like to communicate with people so the score of speaking will be better with joy. To improve my English skills, I have made 4 rules for myself. First, I have to read the newspaper for 30 minutes every day to improve my reading skills. Second, I have to speak with my friends in English every day to improve my listening and speaking skills. Third, I have to do "Write and Improve" tasks; at least 2 tasks every day to enhance my writing skills. Fourth, I have to take a trial test of "TOEFL" every two months to confirm my ability at that time. If I can do these things and make great efforts, the result will be good for me. I'll start to do it today to achieve my goal.

Telling the truth Most people I know believe that you should never tell lies, which is completely correct and understandable. Nevertheless, in my personal opinion it is not always possible to tell only the truth. In some cases I even believe that it is acceptable to tell a lie. Some lies can save you from bad situations. Complex situations need complex solutions. Other lies can help you to achieve your goals, but I do not support these kinds of lies, because it is not right to lie in order to get what you want. This is just rude and unfair towards people who are trying to achieve their goals, but without lies, like normal, good human beings. I would like to give you some examples of situations in which I feel like it is acceptable to lie. There are not many of them, but they exist. The first situation is when you are in direct danger and someone threatens you. For example when you called the police, but when they ask you if you called someone, you say that you did not call anyone. Otherwise, if you told the truth, you could put yourself in even bigger danger. The second situation is when you do not want to hurt someone. You heard your best friend gossiping about your sister and because you do not want to hurt your sister´s feelings you do not tell her about it. She would be extremely upset by it. But in general I do agree that lies are bad.

I think the following three things may be more important than exercise for our health. The first is diet. We have to eat a meal to get good nutrition, like protein, fat, vitamins, and so on. Because nutrition is the source of power, we cannot move our body perfectly without a good diet. The second is rest, especially sleeping. If you run short of sleep, you cannot control your body and your mind correctly. Besides, short sleep is bad for your health because your immune system weakens. Third, I think the most important for our health is keeping good mental conditions. First of all, you have to keep your mental health if you want to get good physical health. To get good mental conditions, you should maintain your thoughts. You should sometimes refresh your mind, for example, playing with friends or drinking with colleagues or having dinner with your family and so on. Good health is where there are good mental conditions.

Greetings Jack, Birthdays are not very different in my country. People celebrate their birthday parties in restaurants, at the cinema , bowling or in shops! Furthermore, there are some particular parties celebrated on ice skating rinks or on the beach. However, for me, the best birthday is with your family, blowing out some candles and eating a big piece of cake! I hope you can write soon. Bye! Inés

A new year has started, here in Liceo Classico. We are all returning back from our vacations, and it's now time to focus on the goal we want to reach this year. I am really interested in Greek. This year we will start studying Greek poetry and I can't wait to do so. Saffo's words have always enchanted my mind and now I am really excited to learn something more about her style and her living. However, I am not interested only in Greek. I know this year we will start to study English literature too, so I know it is a really great opportunity to improve my English. I would really like to be able to get the English certification this year or maybe the next. To achieve my goals I will work hard, because I know that nothing comes from nothing. I want to build my future day after day, learning as much as it is possible. Every new skill I get is a bigger chance to get what I want in life.

I really like to travel around the world, especially with my boyfriend. For the moment we go for low-cost vacations, we don't really have much money. We went to Krakow two years ago and we stayed there for a week. Although Poland became part of the European Union, they still don't have the euro. For this reason it is really convenient for us European people to spend a period there: one euro is worth four of their zloty. Moreover, Krakow is rich in history: we saw lots of interesting buildings, from synagogues to castles. In Krakow there is a strong Hebraic culture, they have seven synagogues, all set in the same district. In the oldest synagogue there's now a museum, but other ones are still used to pray and to celebrate religious functions. The Kupa Synagogue, very small but very colourful, is one of the most beautiful monuments I have ever visited. One hour and a half by bus from Krakow there are the Birkeanau and Auschwitz camps, two of the infamous German camps where Nazis imprisoned Jews during the Nazi regime. I strongly recommend everyone to visit these places to realize how human beings can be cruel and not to forget.

I think the following three things may be different in the future. First, the way of accesseing and its speed. The train and the car may be faster than now and new machines which we cannot imagine may happen to appear someday. Second, the places where we can go. In the near future, we can go to the Moon or Mars. Besides we can go to other planets in the future. Third, sight - seeing spots and traditional spots may decrease due to worldwide globarization and the number of information. Otherwise, the following three things will be the same in the future. The first is communication with people who live there. It is one of the main purposes now and in the future. Second, troublesome packing is always tiring. Third, we are very tired after coming back home. The different points may be more different than I thought, but the same point may be true. Because the journey is what changes you and it is very hard.

Although my experience with "Write and Improve" is too short (I started a week ago), I have learned and progressed a lot. First of all, I like how this website can correct your common mistakes, because I realize that I have to pay more attention. Furthermore, the improvement of my English writing is efficient and fast. However, there are some things I can't deal with. Looking for help, I have thought "Write & Improve" doesn't help very much, and it bothers me because sometimes I don't know why a thing is wrong or another is right. Moreover, when my feedback says "you need to improve more..." and doesn't say what I have to improve, it's very annoying. In conclusion, even if there are some errors in this app, I think it's a good help for people searching for training to do Cambridge tests, so I recommend it to my classmates.

Telling the truth could be painful. However, it's always more valuable than telling a lie. Honest and truthful people are always loved in their communities. Therefore, lies that have been told by dishonest people probably could lead to greater problems and trust issues. Societies always respect and adore truthful people. Moreover, it's not acceptable to tell a lie even if the truth will be difficult to deal with. Being an explicit and straightforward person is more preferable than being known as a liar. I remember one time my friend lied to me about something. When I found out that she was lying and that she had told me false information I was enraged with her. Furthermore, the respect and trust that I had for her was broken. I could have really appreciated it if she had just told the truth. The matter could not adjust any more suitable by telling a lie. Nevertheless, it will make the situation even worse. Some people choose to be implicit to avoid facing a specific problem. For example, my friend Sara had a problem with our friend Suzy. For that reason, their relationship was imperfect, so Suzy asked her what the problem was? Having no problem with her was Sara's response to the question. Despite the confrontational choice, Sara just ducked Suzy. As a result of that, ultimately they stopped talking to each other, which they could obviously have avoided by being honest with one another.

In my opinion, exercise is important for our health, but it isn't enough. Our health is the key to our happiness. First of all, healthy food is more important than exercise. We must eat fruits and vegetables. For our health, we must cook healthy food: chicken with vegetables, fish with rice, soups, and only fruits for dessert: apples, pears, pineapples, kiwi, or grapefruits. Secondly, I think that our happiness is more important. Life is all about problems, stress, running and running again. I think that we must stay calm every day and in every situation and we will find the key to success and a happy life. In conclusion, exercise is important for our health, but it must come with healthy food and a happy and peaceful life. Our happiness depends on our smile, so smile every day to become a healthy person!

Today is 1 September, today is autumn. This summer was incredible. I visited tree countries: France, Italy, and Romania. I like Romania very much, but Paris is my favourite. I think that French people are happy all the time. They really smile all day. I love their food: pizza, pasta, burgers, and croissants. This country is amazing. I saw the famous "Le Tour Eiffel" and the cathedral "Notre Dame." I visited a lot of parks and gardens. Italy is very beautiful too. But I think France is my favourite country because France is cleaner than Italy and people are more educated. Romania is home for me and that's all. Home is love, home is the most beautiful thing that I know. Romania has beautiful places with smart people and Romania is growing every day. I was in Sibiu, Brasov, Constanta, and Sinaia. These are 4 of the many perfect cities in Romania. The clean air of mountains was my happiness last summer.

Yes it is. Health is important, but it is not more important to be healthy than to be rich. I think both are important to live a good life because health and wealth can make our life happy and easy. For example, if you have a lot of money and you are a rich man you can buy a car to go everywhere and every place you want at any time. Also, when you are rich you can marry and make a family. You can even buy an apartment and you can eat healthily every day. Also when you are in good health you can sleep very well and you can work and exercise and play football or any game you want. But when have one of these "heath or wealth" that means you will have trouble in your life because if you are not rich that means you are a poor person, and when you are a poor person you do not have money to buy a car or eat well or buy an apartment. Also, if you are rich and you do not have good health that means you do not sleep very well and you can not play any game. Also you can not work and walk. I think you should balance the health and the wealth in your life to live a good life. So that is what I have today. See you next day with a new essay. My name is Ali, and thank you.

The best holiday that I ever had was my last summer holiday. I and my boyfriend Andrea went to Spotorno, in Italy. We booked a big house in front of Bergeggi island. The house was very big and there were a lot of facilities, such as a big swimming pool, a sea view, and a gym. We stayed there for one month. This house was next to the beach and we had a private beach with all facilities. We played volleyball all day and in the evening we organised a lot of parties on the beach. We also ate a lot of delicious Ligurian dishes, like pasta with pesto sauce or "focaccia." But there is another thing that I'll never forget in my whole life. It was the best holiday I ever had because the 21st of the month it was our 6th anniversary and Andrea asked me to marry him in front of our families and friends. Now we are officially engaged!

There is no doubt that having a fortune could be one of the most important reasons to make you happy. However, the question is: what is more important, to be rich or to be healthy? It is considered one of the controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of the argument there are people who argue that being rich is more important than being healthy. The main reason for believing this is that they think to have a completely wonderful life nowadays you need to have a lot of money, or you will just live a less than ordinary life. Moreover, it is also possible to say that those people also claim that you can have the perfect medical assistance by being wealthy. On the other side, there are people who argue that being a healthy person is much better than being wealthy and losing you health. People often have this opinion because they believe that your health is priceless and it is the most important factor to live a good life at any time. A particularly good point here is that by being healthy you can try and be rich by studying and achieving your goals. It is much safer for you and your life.

Thanks to the spread of the internet we can have many choices in the way of studying. We need not go to school because we can study subjects connected to the internet. We can enter a school which is located far from us or abroad. We can make the style of our school of the future autmatic using the internet, but I think the real school of the future doesn't change a lot. Because what we should do in school is not only study subjects but also develop our social mind. For students, what is most important to learn is how they face difficult problems. They learn it with their friends and classmates and sometimes with people who they hate. Their social mind cannot learn when they are alone. So the school of the future will be convenient thanks to the internet but will not change its essence at all.

There is no doubt that these days technology is becoming a magnificent tool in our life in all aspects. However, the question is: should we depend more on technology than on traditional materials? It is considered one of the controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of the argument, there are people who argue that the advantages of technology outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that using computers and other devices could save a lot of different sorts of information in a very limited space and you can search for the things you want. On the other hand, it is possible to consider it with the opposite opinion. People often argue that using technology could damage students very badly. People often think that it could hurt their eyesight, especially at an early age.

There is no doubt that these days the world is becoming a smaller place due to the improvement of the latest technology. However, the question is, has learning a new language become more important than in the past? It is considered one of the controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of the argument, there are people who argue that learning a new language is an extremely important thing to do, especially these days. People often have this opinion because they believe that learning languages could give you incredible results, such as getting smarter, gaining self-confidence, and most significantly opening the door for you to discover the differences between cultures and people's way of communication. On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it from the opposite side. There are people who argue that learning a new language is not completely an ideal idea. The main reason for believing this is that they think that you can get the benefit of the language you speak only in the country which speaks the same language. So its use would be limited by geographical differences.

Dear Gheorge, Last weekend I was at a music concert. Guess whom I saw? Exactly! You know my favourite music band is Carla's Dreams and I didn't have the patience to wait to hear their voices before the concert started. It was a unique experience. Obviously, I decided to go because I am so keen on their music, but my sister decided to go with me to have fun. I had no doubts that the band's singer, Sergiu would be performing and it was exactly like that. The boys sang a lot of their old songs, but the surprise arrived when they decided to share some lyrics of their new song with us, 'The wings'. The atmosphere was incredible, people danced and sang with the band. I cannot describe my feelings about that concert, and I am so sorry I could not share those moments with you. How about going to another concert together? All the best, Corina

I am writing about my best season of the year. I do believe that all seasons of the year are important and we cannot possibly remove or change one. However, I do prefer two seasons to the others. Firstly, I like summer and that is seemingly quite common, the majority of people have constantly chosen this season as their favourite one. There is no doubt about that. The summer season is commonly preferred due to the weather and the temperature. Summer weather is always the perfect weather, with less rain and sunlight brightly shining. Most people see it as a great period of time for a picnic or playing outdoors. The temperature is another factor, people find it comfortable because they do not have to wear many clothes because the temperature is more than perfect. Moreover, summer is considered to be the time of holiday, which is excepted to many people; it is the perfect time to go to the beach and do sport or swim.

English is very important for our future. There are many reasons for learning English. The first reason is if you want to immigrate to a country where they speak English to study or to work or live there, like Canada, the USA, the UK, or any other, which means you should learn English to connect with people there. And the second reason is English these days is everywhere. If you want to learn about technology, you should learn English first because every technology uses the English language. Almost every technology is made by the countries where they speak English. And the third reason is that presently English is a global language, which makes people around the world learn English to connect with each other to buy things and to sells things. Also, when you learn a new language it will make your mind be at a high level of intelligence and will raise your communication skills to a high level and So that is what I think, and this is my article. See you in a new article and with new information. My name is Ali.

It depends on how people think about this. An extreme argument is quite meaningless here. For example, even if you are very rich, it is meaningless to be bedridden for life or even if you have a good condition, it is meaningless if you have no money. It is nonsense. Of course, both of them are important. For me, I have come to think that to be healthy is important as I am older. It is clear that I cannot live and feed my family if I can't earn enough money. Of course, if I am not rich, the choise the way of daily life and what I can do on holiday. But the basis of daily life is family health. Because we are healthy enough, we have come to have a desire such as being rich. If we are not healthy, all we want is to be healthy, I guess. Therefore my opinion is that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich.

Furthermore, I have planned English lessons in the summer holiday. Perhaps you heard it from mum, but I'm going for four weeks to Belfast to enlarge my English knowledge.

Hi, So, I will introduce my favourite film to you. It is "The wind has risen." It is a famous Japanese animation film produced by Hayao Miyazaki. It shows a real love story and the great efforts that a man made for his dream. The reason I like this film is that the man's daily sustained efforts cheer me and give me courage. And the reason I think you should watch it is that it may be important for you now. Because you are studying to be a doctor, you must make great efforts like him. He is a good example of who you should be someday. Next time, please show me your favourite film. Thank you.

The reason I must learn English is that it is the minimum requirement for me to be a doctor. To be a doctor I studied for 4 years to go to university, but I couldn't pass the exam. When I gave up the dream of being a doctor, the only way left for me was to study at a medical university in Bulgaria. So, all the lectures are given in English, I must study English. Generally speaking, learning English gives you some good results. For example, because the number of people that speak English is the biggest in the world we can learn a worldwide common sense through communication with them. Another reason why it is better for us to learn English is to make many friends. To make friends who are from various countries is good for you because you can get chances that you think about other people and it can spread or change your mind. This is why learning English is important to us.

English is the most studied language in the world and it is a compulsory subject in all schools. I have also been learning English for eight years at school. So why is learning English so important? Firstly, English may be very useful to you for your work. The world is getting even more globalized, and you will need to be able to interact with people who come from all over the world. If you cannot speak English, you won't be able to apply for an important position in your work. So English will be very useful if you want to succeed in your job. In addition, learning English is vital if you like travelling. When you go abroad, no one will be able to talk to you in your mother tongue. So you need to know English to communicate with people. Otherwise you will get in big trouble. Finally, English is essential in your life, so begin learning it!

I know you're very keen to hear about my favourite film. The best film I've ever seen is "The Go-Between." This film is set in England, in 1900. It's based on the popular novel "The Go-Between" by L. P. Hatley. It is a story about a child who goes to his friend's house for his summer holiday. There he meets his friend's sister who wants him to be the go-between between her and her secret lover.

Since the date of its invention, television has become even more important in our life. In fact, we love it because it is able to entertain us. Many people claim that watching television is unhealthy and useless. However, it can also teach you something. Children spend a lot of time watching television. While it is true that there are programmes for children which are poor quality, there are some good cartoons which are educative. Children may learn a foreign language from them, or you can find programmes which teach vital values, such as friendship and loyalty. Obviously, parents must limit the time their children spend watching TV. Moreover, there are also wonderful programmes for grown-up people. They might be about sports or cooking. In addition, there are programmes about health, politics, economics, and so on. There are also great documentaries. They are about all types of science, so they can be very interesting. However, in my view, too few people watch documentaries, also because they are not advertised enough. To sum up, TV programmes can be good or dreadful: it is up to you to make the best choice.

It is widespread and common that people think it is not a problem if they lie once or more often. Other people think differently and are convinced that telling the truth is one of the most important things. In the following I am going to explain my opinion whether lying is acceptable or not. In my opinion, telling the truth is a very important thing. It is a great character trait that many people have lost. I believe in the bible which tells me that lying comes from the devil. The devil is the biggest liar on earth. It means lying is not acceptable for God. The question is why. For sure, at first, lying doesn't look like a problem. There are advantages of lying, too. When I did not do my homework and my teacher wants me to read it out, it may be logical that I lie and say that I cannot find it or whatever. And even if other people ask me something about a secret for example and I cannot tell them, then it is also common that people lie. Is it not understandable? Sure, it is hard to answer. Especially, when it is not just about my advantages but about others'. But all in all I would still think that lying is not the best way. Basically you can hurt people with lying and it cannot be the way to lie because of loving. Who loves, tells the truth. I am convinced that telling the truth is a good way to improve the world. How many problems are created, just because people decided to lie? Yes, it is not acceptable. To lie is a sin.

I think that learning to speak a foreign language is more important than in the past . Of course, because of the invention of the high quality translator we may not need to learn a foreign language. But when you meet someone for business or you make friends, communicating with each other face to face is the best way to make and keep good relationships. Learning a foreign language also leads to understanding people's culture. It will be your legacy. Another reason why we learn a foreign language is that we get more and more chances to speak to people from various countries. The invention of the airplane and the bullet train means we can travel all over the world. And the improvement of information technologies (mainly the internet) can make us communicate with each other even if we are in different countries.

Hey dude, How are you going? Have you had so much fun in your holiday? I must also study hard to improve my English. I have the time schedule for it. I am going to learn English 2 hours each day: one hour for spoken English and 1 hour for writing English. To improve my spoken English, I will watch Game of Thrones, one episode each day and try to imitate the pronunciation of the actors. Furthermore, I will do a writing exercise on the platform of Cambridge every day. I don't have so much time to do it. Actually, I have to improve my English as soon as possible because it is necessary to write and speak English very well for my internship in the summer.

Hi Billal! Last week some of my classmates and I went to compete in a competition in London in the UK! We went to see some of the historic and touristic places in London, and stayed in a school with students from all around the world. It was a long journey from Mexico to the UK, but it was worth it. We also won 2 competitions! The first one was a talent show and the second was about writing. I enjoyed this trip because I got to learn a lot about English and made new friends. Bye Billal!

Nowadays, we know well that if you have a healthy life you will be more delighted with yourself. Firstly, it is undeniable that exercise is important for our health and to have a good physical appearance, and maybe to have a good quality of life because if you move your body you will get distracted from the thing that you have been doing before. Secondly, having a balanced diet is an important point to consider because if you eat healthily you will be fit. Therefore, you might increase your fitness and also your psychological condition. Last but not least, the relationship with friends should be mentioned since if you have a problem, your friend can help you with it. Beside that, friends could be very necessary in your life because with them you can improve your lifestyle and your psychological condition. In conclusion, from my point of view, I think that exercise isn't the most important thing about having a healthy life because there are a lot of things that could be more important.

I completely agree with this statement. It's more important to be healthy than to be rich. Health is more important because money could run out, and also money enables people to exert influence over others, and this isn't a good thing. But, sadly money is vital for survival. Money, in my opinion is a little consolation to those who are suffering from health problems. Despite the fact that with money you can pay for the best medical treatment and care available this is no guarantee of a longer life. Even if an individual is extremely rich, this does not necessarily lead to happiness, in some cases, it is the opposite. Rich people think that with money they can buy everything, sadly love too, but genuine happiness cannot be bought. In the end, money can be an important thing in life, but health is more important than that.

Learning a foreign language is more important these days than it was in the past. The cause is globalization. Now, English is the most widely spoken language all around the world, it is the language of economics and of science. Now, when you are looking for a job, companies look at language skills, because nowadays companies cooperate with foreign companies and speaking a foreign language is very important work-wise. In the past, learning a foreign language was only for rich people, who could pay for expensive language courses. Now, for example, English is beginning to be taught in elementary school and continues to be taught until high school, together in some cases with other foreign languages. The foreign languages that can be taught in high school are French, German, and Spanish, but also Russian and Chinese in some cases. In sum, learning a foreign language widens knowledge, also in the world of work.

Books and technology make for an interesting essay. Nowadays, technology is everywhere in our life. This development, however, has pros and cons. Technology can help us, but I think that the human mind cannot be replaced. Sadly, now computers and tablets are slowly replacing books at schools and universities. Now, the students prefer to "google" a resume of a book rather than read it. They prefer to translate a piece of a novel on the net rather than use a dictionary, and this is a very sad fact. Almost all the young people have never been to a library, because nowadays surfing the net they can find everything they are looking for. At university almost all the courses are composed of multimedia material too, that In the end, technology helps students to raise their knowledge, but the parents of young people must involve children in reading books and going to libraries, too!

Hi Matt, This year, I have a plan to take English online courses and practise English by myself. Every morning, I speak in front of the mirror by myself and study an online course with Thai teacher to improve grammar and reading skills in the evening . Moreover, I listen to English podcasts when I do exercise like running, yoga and cycling. I have been learning speaking through video calls with a Singaporean teacher for a week.

Hey, Elena, How are you going? I haven't heard so much from you in the last two weeks. I hope that you are well. In the last semester, I had such a stressful time, so I used the winter semester break to relax. In the vacation I watched lots of films, most of them are science fiction films, criminal thrillers, and Japanese animated films. Actually, I really found my favorite one: Spirited Away, a Japanese animated coming-of-age fantasy film. Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro Ogio, a 10-year-old girl who, while moving to new neighborhood, enters the world of kami (spirit) of Japanese Shinto folklore. After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world.

In my honest opinion, it is so important to always tell the truth with your partner, parents, boyfriend, girlfriend or whoever. For example, when you are dating another person it is so beautiful to be honest. If you are dishonest, it is so bad, nobody will ever believe you, because you're always lying. The truth is like a dish, if you break this dish just one time, this dish will never be the same. You have only one chance, never two or three, just one chance. Furthermore, it is so incredible when you find a person, when you can always believe in this person with your eyes closed, and your family too. In addition, always everyone should never lie to their family, because our family are our reason to live, when you're sick or whatever, you have only your family to take care you. If you do not have a family, it is not a problem, because I'm sure that you have a person who cares about you. If you live alone, it is not a problem either, we must love ourselves. If you do not believe in yourself, who will believe in you? Therefore, this is my opinion about the importance of always telling the truth to whatever person in the world. I recommend that. It is good for mental health and for everyone.

I am very happy about this new school year. I want to be perfect, not only at English writing but also listening and speaking. Here, teachers have a very sound knowledge and they are teaching very well. As we know, if the teacher is good and he knows how to teach then it is very easy to learn the subject. My English writing and speaking is not as good as that of native Americans. In addition, I am also facing issues at the time of listening. I want to be excellent in these area. As we know, English is a language and to improve any language you should do work on all the dynamics of a language, like listening , speaking , writing, and reading. Hence I have to focus on all parameters of learning. Practice is very important to get a better output. I will do daily practice for writing, listening, and reading as advised by the teachers. And I have made the resolution that I will not speak even a single word of my native language for one month.

I have had many great holidays, but the last one was the best. This one was different because it had a learning purpose . Instead of going to a hotel we went to a camp. The trip was in Spain. There we met a person called Mr. Jackson, who sent us to camp to learn how to deal with a forest and its wild animals . There was a tall man called Mr. Browne who taught us how to treat animals and how to prevent them from harming us if they were hungry. We learned what to do with animals. We also had a lot of fun like watching the sunrise in the morning. It was the most beautiful sunrise I had ever seen. We took many pictures. When we finished learning we had a week to explore things about animals, to fill a book of facts about the forest, and we should present it to the teacher after this week . When we were going back to Egypt we felt upset because we left the camp. It was the best holiday ever.

For my last birthday, I got a concert ticket from my boyfriend. It was an open air concert of Andrea Bocelli, a brilliant Italian singer. I love his songs so much. And our visit was also very pleasant. However, my family doesn't celebrate any birthday except that of my grandpa. The reason is that in China people think only the birthdays of grandparents are important enough to celebrate. But this doesn't mean that I'm less important to my parents. Furthermore, my parents don't celebrate their birthdays either. So it is just a cultural difference.

Write and Improve English is also known as the language of the world, because it can be understood in nearly every country. But not only is it important to be able to speak it fluently, it is also very important to have the ability to write in an appropriate style. Therefore the writing tool Write and Improve was invented. It should help to develop your written English. Feedback The tool is very easy to handle because the only thing you have to do is to write and press the "Check" button. Write and Improve works surprisingly fast and you will have your result within only a few minutes. The feedback you are given is actually tremendously helpful and it tells you very precisely how you might improve and what exactly you did wrong. Furthermore, it is not just a pre-programmed critic, but it really checks every individual task somebody sends to it. You feel quite like sitting in the classroom and getting your essay back. Writing on an electronic device A problem that occurs when writing the first time with a keyboard in English are lots and lots of mistakes due to not being able to write as well as with a pen. Of course this problem can be solved by doing it more often until you get used to doing it, but it would be great to have another opportunity. Even if electronic devices are an everyday gadget nowadays, not everyone is completely comfortable with working with them. Recommendations It would be very helpful to have the chance of sending a hand-written essay via an email, but, nevertheless, this tool is perfectly suited for improving your English.

Nobody wants to be one who is told a lie to, but hardly anybody avoids telling them. Even if this is true, it is, in my opinion, acceptable to lie in the situations I will consider now. It is totally appropriate to lie if the truth would hurt someone so badly that it could not be forgotten again. Imagine the grandfather of your child is already dead and your beloved son is asking you whether he would have liked to play with him or not. If you tell him then that his grandfather would never have done that, because he was against your pregnancy from the beginning on, he would be tremendously hurt. Of course, you know best who can take the truth and who is not strong enough to do so. The second case where a lie is better than the truth is when the truth would cause unnecessary trouble, tension or fear at the wrong moment. People are used to reacting very outrageously in certain situations. If your wife has a skiing accident you had better not tell your children while they are still taking their skiing lessons. The only result would be lots of tears and that would mean more stress for you. Of course, you should tell them in the end, but at the right moment. Telling the truth is not always easy but still hardly ever the wrong choice. Yet if one of the situations above is the case, telling the ugly truth is not the only choice you have.

The school of the future will be very different from today's school in a lot of ways. Firstly, in the future we will have jobs that ask for different skills than now. I believe that we need people who have good computer and technological skills, so the jobs in the future will be different. So the schools should also be different, otherwise we will get a society where most people don't have the skills that we need to run our economy. Nowadays, most schools use books, but in the future we will have schools without books. Every student will be using something like a laptop or tablet to write notes and to do schoolwork. Furthermore, I believe that we can have schools where robots and AI are teaching the students. To have teachers who are able to use these technologies, we have to start learning the skills that we need in the future now. For example, learning how to simulate a program to solve problems like climate change. However, I don't believe that the schools in the future will be significantly different from now, because the base material of most subjects like chemistry and maths will be the same.

Dear Sir, Your plan to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants has come to my attention. I think it is a great initiative to talk about the use of mobile phones in public spaces, but I do not think that the phones should be banned. Most people use their phone for a variety of tasks so they need to have their phones on them while they travel. I do think it is important that people become aware of the fact that it is antisocial to use your phone in shops and restaurants. It is a matter of education, in my opinion. We shouldn't focus on banning stuff. Everybody should be free to make their own decision. Children in school should be taught how to deal with the constant distraction of phones as opposed to telling them to put the thing away. I am convinced that in ten years' time we will have a better understanding of how mobile phones work and what they do to our social life. We should not forget that it is a very useful machine, it allows us to keep in touch with people we love, and gives us the opportunity to look up anything we want to or need to know. I would like to come and talk to you at the council. I'm looking forward to your reply. Kind regards, Leonie Patterson

I know from my experiences that exercising is a vital part of human life. It is not just about being physically fit. It is a lot deeper. Of course, if you are fit, most things are easier for you. You feel better and you even feel better about yourself, and it improves your life. But it is not the most important part for me. What I see as the key aspect of exercising is improving your mental strength. You have to suffer to grow. Nothing easy can make you better and if you can do something physically demanding every day, you can improve your brain and make yourself stronger and better. You can use it in aspects of everyday life. You need to get out of your comfort zone and feel the pain and most importantly handle it. And the best way to do it is by exercising. So, I doubt that you can find something really more important because exercise is a basic part of your life and you need proper basics.

I am an English learner who is doing all his best to pass the Cambridge C1 exams, and I always look for every tool that can help me to get my goal. I jumped into a new internet site where the opportunity to make some improvements is given, especially in the part where students are weaker. This is because I am practicing some types of writings with the help of the new site I discovered. The site seems well-managed and it gives all the tools whose use is expected to get satisfactory results. The main feature I appreciate is to choose what kind of writing I want to practise: an essay, a report or an article, in other words all the tasks that I could be required to write. It should not be forgotten the section "task timer" that makes you sure about the time you are spending on every single writing so that you can organise your time in a risk-free way. However, I must admit I have some difficulties, for example, when I must decide which task to do, and it depends on the length of the title task; it had better be a shorter one. On the whole, I strongly recommend surfing the site, doing the registration process and being patient before seeing all the improvements you want to make. Hard study is the key to success. There are no doubts about its usefulness, tasks are sent to an examiner who will write back to you with the corrections and the stressed mistakes.

Write and Improve is a simple tool for improving language skills. I just started using it and I have to admit that it can really help you. By entering texts to provided tasks you train your ability to use a foreign language. Moreover, it is possible to get feedback in the end. Due to the correction, you can focus on your individual weaknesses in order to turn them into strengths. Though some of the topics may seem a little bit out of context, it is a good possibility to train yourself. Concerning the tasks themselves it would be necessary to focus on relevant topics for exams in my opinion. Maybe I just have to explore whether there are any tasks I would like to do. Still, I would highly recommend using "Write and Improve" since no similar program exists at the moment.

The school of the future To start with, it has to be mentioned that school has nearly stayed the same for decades. However, a real change is definitely needed. What may this look like? Nobody knows yet, but some ideas already exist. First, grades in general will be abandoned because they do not lead to higher student motivation any more. What is more is that they only create a lot more pressure that keeps students from being interested in school. Therefore, I think the emphasis should be put on how to get kids to learn voluntarily. If there is a good relationship between teachers and students the results will be better as well. On the other hand, some structures will possibly last. Organising classes in separate rooms is still up to date. Furthermore I think that books will also stay for a few more years just because kids should remember how it is to use them. Maybe there are even other changes we could not imagine nowadays. Let's just wait and find out.

My reasons for learning English An activity is always started because of an initial intention. Going to the gym in order to get fit or watching TV to learn something about other countries, for instance. For me, learning English is something I do not want to stop doing in the near future. The main reason may be clear: improving language skills will help me in my future business as well as in my general work life. However, for me, there is more than this side of the coin. First, I want to travel a lot and the language needed is English. Of course, other languages would be useful as well. Still, I think that English is the most important one. Due to the many people who have at least a basic knowledge of speaking or writing English it is the most required language. Communication is necessary, both in private life and in the world of work. Therefore, do not let anyone stop you from learning English and always try your best!

I think that banning the use of mobile phones in public places is a terrible idea. It is nonsense to ban everyone from using mobile phones. Of course some functions of mobile phones in particular situations should be prohibited. Talking on a mobile phone on public transport and in restaurants and theatres are good examples. But almost all functions that mobile phones have should not be prohibited. Because mobile phones have many functions so as not to annoy people in public spaces. We can do many things with mobile phones silently. We can communicate with friends or business partners by using e-mail and enjoy watching SNS or movie sites like YOUTUBE. We also can study or work while connected on the internet. Today we pack many things in mobile phones. If you totally ban the use of mobile phones, you must ban reading a book, listening to music, writing something, solving crossword puzzles and so on. This is what you are going to do. Banning the use of mobile phones in public places will give us only negative influences. It robs us of thinking about cases whether it is right to use mobile phones or not. Total banning of the use of mobile phones is a kind of insult to us. If you think of us seriously and you treat us as not ridiculous, please give us the chance to think of using phones in several situations.

Having a healthy lifestyle is nowadays important for everyone and though everyone knows how to accomplish that goal, it is not happening that often. The problem is that school children or university students often do not do enough sports during the week. But still it would not be a solution to force them to do sports activities at least three times a week. Everyone should be able to decide on their own if they want to do sport and how often. Of course, school children often spend most of their time inside with their mobile phone or else, but not all of them. If you force those who are inactive to be active and do some sport, it might happen that they hate it afterwards. They are taught about the necessity of health and sports often enough to decide on their own. A total of sports activities three times a week while having two different exams in one week leads to a lot of stress. It occurs often that young people want to be active but simply do not have enough time for it because school and university can be so physically demanding. Of course going for a run can be really relaxing because you can organize your thoughts. But when you have to think of analysis it can be really stressful as well. Especially if you are forced to do so. It basically produces a lot of pressure and you do not have as much fun as you could possibly have. Still sport is very important for everyone of us and therefore there should be other opportunities instead. To motivate young people in school or at university to become active you could introduce different kinds of sports to them. One possible way would be to simply organize a trip to a climbing hall and show them how wonderful this sport could be.

Here comes a new school year. It is my last year in this school. I am looking forward to the graduation, I am already fed up with this system. I have got some challenges in this year and I have to pass them all to graduate. The first one is to reach level one in the STANAG6001 exam for German. Then I have to reach 100% of credits. For that I have to serve for one month in Prostejov. That is the most exciting part. After school, I will serve there so I have a chance to learn a lot about my future working place and about my subordinates. After that comes the hard part. I have to finish my diploms work and if I pass I would be allowed to finex exams. Once I pass everything, I can start the next phase of my life. However, it would be great to improve in my English before I go, so I will try to reach a higher level in my English by taking part in the STANAG3 exam.

I think it is acceptable to tell a lie. Of course I don't like a lie which is told for selfish reasons or helping only myself. But you need to tell a lie in several specific situations. For example, the situation is that your grandfather or grandmother is in a hospital and the rest of his or her life is only a month. Do you need to tell the truth in this situation? I want them to live vividly without any concerns instead of telling the truth. Of course, his or her opinion should be a priority. Another situation is that you and your classmates take a bus to go on a picnic. Then one girl feels bad and gets carsick but it takes more than an hour to arrive at the destination. Then you should tell her that we will arrive soon and take it easy. If you think it is important to always tell the truth, it is very easy and simple to live. But I think that you throw away the chance of thinking about other people. If you take part in a society, you should treat others more preciously. Do you think that always telling the truth is not for everyone but for only yourself? I think that if you tell a lie to people, it is more important than if you always tell the truth.

At first, you should set goals as to when you want to learn a new language. The goals of learning a language is known which are, you should be fluent in listening, reading, writing, and speaking. In addition, you should acquire some vocabulary every day. So these are the most important things to learn any language. So if you want to start, you should begin with listening. Listening is very important for someone who begins. If we look at a kid, he begins listening in his family, then he speaks, and in the end he enters a school and starts to learn to read and write. In fact, learning a new language is important for your IQ because when you learn a new language it means your IQ will be on a high level. And it is up to you which language you should learn, it is up to which goals you want to achieve. But I think English is the most important of all languages because it is an international language. So in each country around the world you can speak English. So this is what I have today, see you next day with a new essay. My name is Ali.

Hi Billal, I am writing an email to tell you about a trip I went on last weekend. I know that if you had not got sick, you would have come with us. Last week, we went to a beach instead of a floating market. Yes, we changed the plan of a one day trip because we had a lot of time to stay at the beach for one night. In the morning, we walked along the beach and took many photos. That day was windy and sunny. We played volleyball on the beach near the homestay in the afternoon. Then, we went to a seafood market to buy shrimps, oysters, and crabs to cook for dinner. The seafood was very delicious and fresh. We were singing while Brian was playing the guitar. It was a good time for the last school year. I hope you get well soon and join us next trip. I miss you, Por

My favorite subject is math. I never get tired of it even though I have been studying it for ten hours every day. Racking my brain about math problems gives me pleasure. But I have some problems. I can solve difficult problems if I have a lot of time, but the exam I'm going to take is a time-limited one. This is because I want to reduce the amount of time I need to come up with the solution for problems. On top of that, I'd like to improve my arithmetic ability, which also reduces time loss. To achieve this, I will do a problem-solving exercise every week. In this exercise, I must solve six problems within 150 minutes, as I do in the exam. Then, I will analyze the causes of loss of time, and consider feasible measures for them. And, I also make it a rule not to give up on a calculation in the middle.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? If I were to answer this question, I would say, "Yes." I have reasons to support this opinion. I know that traditional books, such as textbooks or workbooks, are very good for both students and teachers' learning and teaching methods, but, recently, there is a movement that supports the use of technological textbooks or workbooks. (I will call them "e-textbooks or e-workbook" now). I totally support this movement because by using "e-textbooks" or "e-workbooks," I believe that there will be a lot of benefits. For example, I believe that e-textbooks can help visualize some complicated things, such as chemical compounds or body mechanisms, and e-workbooks will be able able to do answer checks automatically. Plus, by accepting this method, I believe that there will be less burden for both students and teachers and they will be able to focus on some other things. I think it's full of benefits, not only for students, but also for teachers. For these reasons, I think there is a high possibility that school textbooks and workbooks will be replaced by technological ones.

My reasons for learning English Learning English is almost obligatory nowadays. When you speak English, many things are open to you, such as jobs, studies, or even friends! For instance, I personally spend a lot of time surfing on the web, and during all of this time, I have sometimes met new people from all around the world. Having learned English the way I did permitted me to talk to those people and to debate with them! I became interested in new cultures, new ways of thinking, and countries. Yet learning English is also important to me for my studies. I would love to be accepted in a prestigious high school with anglophone students. Maybe I'm too ambitious, but it's important to have dreams and to follow them! Furthermore, I just love learning languages, especially English. I don't know why is it so special to me, but I don't always need a reason to do something, right? Just go for it, and have fun !

The school of the future An exciting assumption: the school of the future. There's something that always makes me wonder. Why do schools have the same profile since I was a child? They try to update the schedule, try to improve the qualifications of teachers, but the hours are always the same. Today, parents, especially mothers need to work not only in the house. So they need to leave their children in a safe place where they know their children will have many educational activities. But the hours that schools offer are rarely in accord with parents' timetable. If they supply this necessity, they are very expensive. So it's important to adapt school hours. They should be flexible with hours. They will need to offer activities related to computer technologies. If they don't, students will be bored and not interested in classes. Some professions will be replaced by modern ones. So, schools will need to offer courses to qualify workers for these new tendencies.

I partly agree with the opinion to live a long life because of the possibilities to see something I can't imagine now and to watch the world cup soccer in Japan increase as I live a long life. Besides, if I knew my life span was 100 years, I could make various life plans. I think that It may be more useful to know my life span than to live a long life. But I mainly agree with the opinion to live a short but much more intense life. There are two reasons. First, I know who I am. I'm not a good man nor being diligent. If I have a long-span life, I will definitely become lazy and just live in vain. I have no confidence that I will make my life fruitful. Second, if I can live long, nobody knows my healthy life span. If I were in a hospital more than 50 years, it would be the most painful thing for me. The life that is short but intense is so cool. I think that a past great person's life is relatively short. Like them, I want to live actively and accomplish something great. To be honest, I don't want to know my life span. In spite of the length of span, I will be disappointed with everything and can't do any more. I manage to live my life because I don't know when I'm going to die.

Two months ago I went on a sightseeing holiday with my family in Italy. That was the first time I had ever traveled abroad, so I was very excited. It was mostly because I had to convince my parents that it was the perfect moment in our lives for such a holiday. The flight there lasted only for about two hours, although it felt like an eternity to me. Once there, we went to the hotel to leave our luggage. Then we visited Vatican City. I had such a wonderful sensation walking through the galleries like I could see Michelangelo and Raphael working. The guide made us feel as if we were a part of that extraordinary piece of art. We also saw the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and La Fontana di Trevi, and we couldn't avoid eating pizza and ice cream. Although I liked everything we saw, I felt a deep attraction for the Vatican's art galleries. The paintings looked so alive, like I could transfer myself to that period only by staring at them. All together it was the best holiday I have ever had because, after all, I visited more than one place and learned a lot of things.

Hello. I think I have a lot of goals that should be achieved in this school year. And one thing is for sure, I did some foreign language courses, but I never stop improving my level. Besides, I would also love to learn something else to enhance my journey on the path to a creative career. The best point is that I would learn to play instruments, so that I can write my own songs and perform them on stage some day. An image of a little girl playing the guitar very well has been built in my head recently. Though I'm not sure it's easy to learn, but if I achieve it as well, that will be the most wonderful feeling I have ever experienced. Thus, this motivates me to get it as soon as possible. I'm going to register for a guitar course tomorrow thinking that will lead me to a new skill at a level of my life where I can cope with problems more creatively. Currently, I don't know how to play at all, so I should write down for myself a process to track my learning speed, so that I can appreciate my progress. Hopefully, the process should be got right as the way it is intended.

In my opinion, every student should have at least a few lessons of music. Of course, there are schools that prepare students for a career in the music business. Due to this, more lessons are needed. For "normal" schools though I think that music should be a relaxing session to calm down and forget about the daily stress. I think that music really helps to get into a good mood again. So everyone should have music courses in school. Music is not a subject you necessarily get a grade in, but it should be a group-building, free time activity. There should not be any restrictions, so that teachers can create individual experiences for every class. I am sure that music has a good influence on everyone's health and it could also help to prevent illnesses. Burn-out, for example , which is common among pupils, could be eliminated. Therefore, every school should offer some music courses!

Yes, I do. I like to exercise very much because I want my body to be stronger than before and I want to lose weight. I exercise every day in the morning and evening. In the morning I work out for 30 minutes following a trainer on Youtube channel. I run for 30 minutes every day in the evening. Normally, I prefer exercising outside because I can breathe the natural air that is good for my health and better than the air conditioning in a gym. Actually, air conditioning is not good for health. The second reason, my house is far from the gym. I like running and swimming because I use every part of body to do these exercises and use fewer accessories.

I think that studying abroad is the best choice that a student can make. Studying abroad, especially for foreign language students is the right opportunity to improve a language and speak a lot. It's an opportunity to grow first, far from the family, but also to make friends with students from all around the world. But there are also disadvantages to this type of opportunity, like the accommodation. In some cases, the accommodation for the students abroad is very far from universities and high schools and they must take a lot of buses to go to school. Another problem is that, nowadays, young people are very spoiled and so some of them maybe can't do housework. Studying abroad means that you must follow the school lessons, do homework, run the washing machine, cook, and a thousand other things and not everyone, in my opinion, is capable. So, studying abroad is an important opportunity, but if a student decides to take this opportunity he has to roll up his sleeves.

I think that all students should have to study music. Why I think so are the following 2 reasons. First, studying music can bring some good influences on other subjects. You know when we play music, we use another part of the brain compared to studying maths, chemistry, biology and so on. Using the parts which you usually don't use, you can activate your brain and you may break through something. Second, I think that all students should study as many subjects as possible. Of course, college students and students who decide to major in a particular subject may not need to study music. But for other students there are no reasons why it is good to regurate their subjects. Studying music they can feel their talents that they couldn't notice before. I think that it is important that we should offer whatever opportunities because all students may have an interest. We should not cut their curiosity to study something. And all students may not like studying music. But it is necessary for them to experience things which they don't like. School is the place for not only studying subjects but also having experiences with your classmates. Students should experience various things for their future.

Of course there are many people who have no choice where to live because of financial reasons. But if they can choose the place, I partly agree with the opinion that students move away and live on their own. There are two main reasons. First, students can experience various things. They have to do all the chores by themselves. They also must control themselves and judge everything they are related to. Whatever they experience is useful for the future. It is efficient to live on their own earlier so that they will leave their home sooner or later. Second, it saves time that if live near their university. I think that commuting time is one of the most meaningless. If they can save their time, they are pleased to live on their own. But I mainly agree with the opinion that students live at home with their family because the time that you live with your family is the most precious in your life. Besides this time is limited. When you want to be with them or you want to do something for them, they may not be there. Almost all the students will leave home in the future. So they should be with their family as long as possible. Many things that you would experience if you live alone aren't needed for you in your college days. You should be with your family and you should make precious memories.

Zoos are one of the most interesting attractions for children, but also for their parents. But there are a lot of different opinions about zoos. Many people believe that zoos are good places for children to learn about animals and I completely agree with them. A zoo is an important place where kids can learn and discover many different and also uncommon animals. On the other hand, many people believe animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. This is also an important point of view. It is true that it is wrong to keep them in zoos, but lots of the animals that we see in zoos, are animals that were taken away from difficult situations, where they would not have survived outside captivity. If, on one hand, I agree with people that believe zoos are a good place for learning about nature and animals, I completely disagree with circuses, where animals are forced to perform funny scenes to amuse spectators.

Nowadays, video games are an important part of children's life. If, on one hand some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, and I agree with this feeling, on the other hand, there are others that believe that video games may have some positive effects. It is a complex question. It is true that video games may have some positive effects, such as improving certain skills, but I'm completely sure that new video games can have a big negative impact on children. Now, there are a lot of war video games, where children must kill each other to win, and this, in my opinion is sad. Educational video games are not attractive for children, they prefer violent video games. In the end, parents of young children must try to tell their children that video games can be dangerous and also they must try to avoid children playing for many hours.

When I am too busy, I also go for a walk for about 15 minutes in the evening. I prefer outside activities. Going outside is more interesting. I can exercise and be relaxed at the same time. When I walk outdoors, I can breathe fresh air, enjoy the atmosphere and watch people's daily activities. Going to a gym is not very comfortable for me. Many people gather at the same place. Sometimes, it is very noisy at the gym. People who go to a gym could not enjoy as many things as when you go outside. I like outdoor walks. As I mentioned, when walking outside, I can enjoy many things at the same time. Walking is actually very beneficial for your health, both physically and mentally.

MODERN SCHOOLS The older we are getting, the more technological progress we can see. We create flying cars in our heads thinking about the future. But how about schools? What will they look like in the next hundred years? When you turn back a hundred years, you see how many changes have happened since that time. We already learn with different devices in school. The teachers show information not only on blackboards, but also on electric whiteboards, on which they can freely turn to the next topics. So what's next? It is believed that in the future robots will take over human work. So this is how I see it... Teachers will be replaced by robots, but they will still look like real human beings. I also think that in the future students will have to give their fingerprints to prevent burglaries. We may also have special applications with our school achievements. But I suppose sitting in wooden chairs in front of a desk will never change, because it is the only way teaching can be done. I also think school canteens will still operate giving delicious dinners to students.

Dear workers in the town council, I’m writing to you regarding the issue with the use of portable devices such as mobile phones in public spaces. Recent research indicates that the number of users in the last few years has rapidly increased and mobile phones have become an integral part of us. On the one hand, due to the usage of mobile phones in public places, citizens are showing disrespect for their companions and other individuals. This conduct leads the population to become introvert. On the other hand, for many people mobile phones are a necessity due to work or a private matter. For our ancestors it was unimaginable to have a piece of cutting-edge technology in their pocket, but for us, the descendants, it means that sometimes the usage of cell phone in a restaurant is unavoidable. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a need to take measures regarding this matter. The burden of responsibility lies in the hands of any of us. As regards the most appropriate response to this situation, one suggestion would be to start a campaign to show the nation the disadvantages of overusing their mobile phones in public places. In my opinion, it would be wrong to take the law into your own hands and completely prohibit using cell phones. It would be great to put all factors in perspective before concluding. The world would surely be a better place to live in if we all have respect for each other. After all, we are only humans but have all the time in our hands to think over and create a better tomorrow for our successors.

Dear Mark, As I mentioned in my previous letter, at last I convinced my father to go to the cinema with me to watch my favourite movie "The Matrix." I have watched The Matrix six times so far. Each time I watch it, I find some new information. I like this movie because it gives me a sense of why we are here in this world as humans, and it makes me appreciate the beauty of my life. Especially the character of Neo is fantastic: the way he is presented and how he fits into the story. I believe if you give The Matrix a chance, you will love it as well.

This is a great question. I have a 10-year-old boy. He loves video games and computer games. I do agree with both. It all depends. There is nothing wrong with technology. When you play games, your imagination works in an amazing way. It builds your creativity. On the other hand, some adults and kids suffer from addiction. Not every situation is the same. I believe we are living in an amazing time in history and we can use technology any way we want to use it. It is very important to know your limits. Everything has to be balanced. Playing games and playing in the playground has the same importance for kids. Both are important. My son is doing both . He's a lover of games, but he also enjoys meeting friends and cycling .

I think this is very difficult question because if you think deeply you can easily agree with both . Some of the questions are not possible to answer just in one word. Yes, I agree. Animals belong in nature , but from another point of view we learn a lot during an observation in a zoo. I think all places like this have to be well prepared for animals, including a huge, extra space for certain animals. Yes, in a perfect world all animals will be living free outside. But we are not living in the perfect world. We are still learning and we are still improving . This is what has to be done: improvement. Another important subject is to make sure the right people work in the right departments, especially if we talk about places like zoos. They have to love animals, this is important to make sure these people are responsible for all standard and they are doing what is good for animals.

Studying abroad is a fantastic life experience. I can understand how difficult it is to live alone in a different country without friends and family. Anyway, in my opinion there are a lot of benefits to doing this . First of all, if you study abroad and you are alone, the first thing you learn is a responsibility for yourself. I believe if you live in a different country you become a more open-minded person . It is very interesting to meet different people and try different food. This is a great time to learn or improve a new language. Of course, there are a lot of disadvantages and not everything is easy. You may feel lonely sometimes and you are not able to pop in for a dinner at your grandma's . Everything has positive and negative sides . I have lived abroad for 10 years.

Well, of course now I don't think every student must learn music. It is not the basic important thing in our lives. Some people have a big passion for music and art and they should have an opportunity and chance to study whatever they want to study. Not every one is the same. I remember myself as a child in primary school. I didn't like music lessons. I had a very bad teacher and she pushed everyone to sing alone in front of the others. It was one of the worst experiences in my entire life. When I was a child I was very shy. This situation didn't help me at all. It was traumatic for me. Some people are great in activities. Some people had a mathematical mind. Some people love technology. There is no rational point for me to push students to play or sing.

There is no better choice. I think it all depends what type of person you are. Some people like to be independent and they are mature enough to live alone. Being alone gives them more space and they learn more about life and themselves. Some people may need extra support and attention from their parents or family. This is up to personal circumstances. I think it is nice to have a free head , free from worries about food or washing. This is helpful if you study a lot. But from another point of view I believe it is great to be an independent person. This has the same importance, equal to education. Which one is better? Living on your own while you attend university or living at home with the family? If you have a nice and helpful family, I would say " why not "?

I don't like video games. But a year ago, my son asked me for a PlayStation 4 as a birthday gift. My husband convinced me to buy the video game machine, considering that it was his birthday and we had the capacity to afford an expensive present. I remember that I had video games when I was a child, but I never enjoyed them much. I never was a very good player. I think children should spend time playing games that involve physical activities. For the children's development it is important to run, to jump, to dance, etc. Video games are addictive. The children who play video games usually don't go outside to exercise. Also, video games don't allow the social interaction that children need. In order to create a balance, my husband and have decided to limit the video game playing time. Also, my son has to do his homework before playing video games every day. He is in a baseball league. As a baseball player, he practices sports regularly. Also, we go outside as a family every weekend.

Greetings, I would like to state that I support this policy personally. Nowadays, even though the appearance of the mobile phones does really have a huge positive impact on our everyday life in the aspect of convenience, we unfortunately have a few more issues due to the over-reliance on mobile phones. That is, the reasons for banning phones in public areas will help people to live a healthy life. First of all, people will acknowledge the risk of not paying enough attention to their surroundings. For example, last week's accident in a coffee shop near my apartment was because the victim's attention had been drawn to his mobile phone. This makes them unable to react when it is still not too late to do so. Therefore, if we decide to forbid mobile phones in public areas, it will save a lot of people from scalds when they can notice it early. Second, it is not hard to find out that a lot of people tend to have humpbacked poses while using their phone, it may be common to everyone. Nevertheless, the potential risk it may cause to our spine is definitely one thing no one ever wants to run into. If people don't correct their posture while using a phone or just prevent themselves from using it too much, it is reasonable to have such a strict policy to protect our citizens. As a result, restricting people from using phones might be inconvenient, but it is still a good idea for public health in the long run.

First, she sang in English, but now has already changed to Dutch. I think she is the best and nicest singer of the Netherlands. And I can also do almost all of her songs.

People have always been told that honesty is one of the most important virtues since they were little, which means they should always avoid lying to others. Even though no specific reasons were given at that time, teachers prefer to tell children moral stories. People think of their childhood while reviewing old photo albums. These memories might be reminiscent of the importance of being honest, as their teacher once told them. People will have to face several consequences if they are found being deceitful. There is a really simple fact about lying to others: they will choose not to listen to you next time. It can be troublesome when you need help in the future. What's worse, if there are fraudulent criminals who disguised their conspiracies as charity all over the place, it would have a devastating impact on people's faith in giving a hand to those in need in the long run. When it is becoming harder and harder for them to receive any help, it could be one of the most desperate things that can happen to our society. Also, bragging about yourself, as a form of lying, always makes your feelings hollow eventually. Not to mention trying to cover up these lies with other lies, and it will end up out of hand. Last but not least, lying will make you blind to where you can improve to be a better person. Not knowing their shortcomings, some people create a false impression of themselves by lying to others. Those are my thoughts about how unacceptable it is to tell a lie.

Recent research indicates that people's lifespan has increased through the last decades. Even if we live a way more dynamic life than our ancestors, through all the mod cons a huge development in medicine has been made. What impact, if any, have these developments had on the general public’s opinion? There is no doubt that most of the population would want to live a long intense life. However, it is an act of God how long we can stay on the earth. Anyway, we can decide if our remaining years will be intensive or not. Let’s consider two situations. Firstly, we could have a relatively long life indulged with plenty of leisure time. We should change our tune towards being less career-oriented and abandon ourselves to more pastimes. It doesn’t mean being couch potatoes, rather spoiling ourselves with more time for socializing and bringing our friends and acquaintances together. Secondly, if we consider a shorter life filled with intensity, in my opinion, finding the right work - life balance is the masterwork. Our lifestyle needs to be so aligned that we can combine having a successful career with taking time in our hands to hang out with family, spouse and friends. The world will surely be a better place to live in if everybody has a life fulfilled with enjoyment and happiness. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel, we just sometimes need to live on the spur of the moment.

I am very satisfied with my marks in English and philosophy, as I have got an A+ in both the subjects. However, I think there is still space for improvement in the latter, as I do not quite feel comfortable in that subject. I often perceive that I just do not understand the context of the philosophers' theories, for instance. One of my worst subjects is music, yet unfortunately it is, besides German, my advanced course. I am not bad in it, though, at least it is still an A, even though with an appendaged minus. But I must have high expectations, due to the difficulties you can come across when getting a rare place at university. But how to improve in music? I could ask my music teacher if I do not understand her explanations. It is also always helpful to become more devoted in the lessons, as the written examinations only count a third. Just raising your hand more frequently can work wonders, I guess.

In 2017, we spent a fortnight in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was an important experience for me, because I had just started being interested in the English language and culture. We did a lot of standard tourist programmes, including two bus trips through the Highlands. Even though I normally despise mountains, I could not help being fascinated by the magnificent Scottish mountains and their light green tinge. Furthermore, we visited the famous Edinburgh Castle, which lies exactly in the center of the city. We even hiked in the bosom of Edinburgh, as there is a vast stretch of land containing large rocks only a few bus stops further on. And believe it or not: there was access to the North sea as well! Sea, mountains, and a capital city, all in one! Moreover, that holiday gave me a first-hand experience of how multifaceted the English language with all its different accents is. Even being a complete layman in that language back then, I was able to notice that the Scottish people spoke differently from what I had so far heard. All in all, that stay was one of my best holidays I ever had, maybe even the best of all.

Nowadays, it is a fact that the vast majority of children like to spend their time playing video games. I think that is a good way of entertainment, but only if it is done with control. Firstly, it is understandable that parents do not like video games, because it can bring about several problems for their kids. For example, it can make them more violent, antisocial, addicted, .... On the other hand, I believe that this hobby can help young people because it can bring some benefits too, such as improving their creativity, developing their imagination, and helping them to make friends... A further point is that the most important facts when deciding if video games are good or bad are how much time you use them and what type of video game you are playing. In conclusion, from my point of view, video games are not such a negative thing like most parents think, but it all depends on how much control you have when you are playing them.

In my opinion, animals belong in nature, but I am not against zoos. Please don't confuse my words. I think zoos are important. Zoos allow people to learn about animals, their environment, and what they eat. Furthermore, zoos are a family space where children can enjoy nature without the risks associated with wild life. Also, the most important zoos in the world have helped to preserve some animal species which are disappearing. For example, many animals in danger of extinction have reproduced in zoos. On the other hand, I don't agree with people who have wild animals locked in cages. In my country, there are many people who have exotic birds in cages. Other people have squirrels and turtles as a pet. I think this is animal cruelty. Ordinary people don't know about healthcare for wild animals. Also, these people don't supply suitable food for their animals. These animals can't reproduce in captivity because they don't have a mate.

Governments need to respect and support art and give the opportunity to live art and people will have the opportunity to develop their abilities. Nowadays there are countries that don't care about art. All the countries could be responsible with the population and give the opportunity to everyone to have the chance to develop their abilities and learn about new things.

We are not going to pay humans when technology can do exactly the same work. However, it will be harmful because the teacher's sensibility will not be present in the classroom. Fortunately, the programs will be chosen by the students and no longer undergone by them. There will be a lot of work to do from home and less work in class. The aim being to limit meals in the canteen, the heating, and human relations with lice. Everything will be possible online and checks will be done by email.

Following a study at another university during your high school or university will increase your cultural knowledge. A student who opts for a course abroad has a good chance to meet people who have a different cultural and educational background. You can see the world outside your homeland. This will have many advantages for students because as we know we live a world where globalization is accelerating. There are companies which demand experience abroad to fill an open position. So, in a globalized job market it is very important to have international experience. Different studies show that the students who followed studies abroad have more chance to find a job within six months than those who do not have this experience. Furthermore, if you have knowledge of different cultures you can better communicate with all types of people. It helps also to understand the emotional aspects of other people. Because of studying abroad you can discover new foods. Furthermore, you can make new friends. You also have the chance to learn a new language. If you speak more than one language, it means you have better job prospects than those who speak one language. For example, in my homeland, the Netherlands, it is very important to speak English, because in the Netherlands we have a lot of companies which have an international network, for example Unilever and Philips. Furthermore, there are companies who demand you speak the German language, because we export a lot of goods to Germany.

Nowadays, in almost all cities around the world we can find a zoo, but in my opinion, zoos are places where most animals suffer and we should close most of them. Firstly, people think that zoos are places where kids will have a very enjoyable time because they can see exotic animals, but they do not think about how stressed and scared this will make them feel. On the other hand, the fact of being able to see such wonderful animals so close to us, is an awesome experience, because you can realise how astonishing nature is. A further point is that animals in zoos are locked in, usually not in very ample spaces, and these animals being wild animals must be free in their own habitat. Moreover, they do not receive the best feed and that is why most of them die. In conclusion, from my point of view, I believe that zoos must be closed because although we can see a lot of incredible animal species, while we enjoy it, they suffer and we should let them live free.

Last century was the era of fossil energy and in the next few years electricity will be the king of energy because cars will use this energy to move. In some applications, such as heavy transport electric engines need to develop better technology such as batteries with more capacity to give them more autonomy. However, in cars we have already got enough technology to make it the method of transport for ninety percent of the people going to work. To travel by car, despite the fact that the autonomy can be for five hundred kilometers, next year's service areas on highways will have a lot of points to charge our electric car and give us more range to travel in one day. In fact, long trips by car can be more comfortable for us because the artificial intelligence applied to cars can make them autonomous and give us a safe way to travel. Ultimately, the next few years will be amazing for the transport of people and heavy trucks.

Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, like me. When I was a university student, I went to another city for my university education. This time improved my character and helped my personal capacity. In my opinion, university life is the most important thing for people. Humans are improving their capacity for university education and life. Some university sections are useful for living another city, like management schools, engineering, nursing, etc. But medical universities don't approraite this type of life because a medical education is a harder education than the others. Medical students must work hard for their success so they need a comfortable life for their education life process. These students should live at home with their family to complete their university education. Absolutely this type of choice interested in people's expectations for a university education.

A greater incorporation of electronics is required to happen, as it will offer you a new scope of possibilities. You will be able to attend school in spite of a slight cold, as online teaching will be an inevitable change in education. But the consequence is a rising lack of social qualities on the side of the students. Instead of communicating by sitting beside each other, their only way of talking to each other in their online-school takes place through text messages. Everyone is aware of the negative result originating from that. Being isolated in your room, staring at the screen several hours in one go, runs counter to active and often sociable children. Furthermore, the lacking opportunities of sports lessons would aggravate the problem of lassitude, as physical exertion would get constantly less important. Many students would soon need glasses, too. To conclude, I regard the physical school we are still used to nowadays as substantial for a child's education.

Music is a subject that is not required in Brazil, but in other countries it is considered essential for school graduation. I think that music classes are very important, because they improve the IQ and are a good way to relax. So, I think that having music classes is very important. A study at Northwestern University shows that the students who study music have an increased IQ compared to the students that do not study it. The reason is music is a great way to memorize things, make you feel happy and works on most parts of the brain, like memory, creativity and critical sense. Because of music some students can develop more than others and this does not look fair, some parents do not have money to pay for music classes, and the instrument and private classes are very expensive. Improving the brain of children is a first step to change the quality of a country, because they bring money for the country with the culture and entertainment or can increase the economy, because they learn better the subjects that they had in school, because music helps them to memorize.

I'm not sure whether I can call it a holiday or not. It wasn't an outright holiday, but in that period of time, I and my friends spent a lot more time together and had so many activities, such as studying our major subject at one of the best schools in Vietnam, getting around Ho Chi Minh City, joining some club at BK Dorm, and meeting many new friends . So I will talk about it. My favourite holiday was in the summer of 2019. I was in the school physics team. In this team, we learned a lot about physics. It was really hard to join physics competitions and get awards. And we got support from my school, they provided money for us to learn in the High School for the Gifted in Ho Chi Minh City. Of course, we moved to Sai Gon that summer. At that time, we studied physics with an excellent teacher, his name was Pham Hoang, and his class was in the morning. They were the worst mornings of my life. He taught things that I couldn't understand at all. But after that, everything for me was like heaven. I had all the time in the afternoon and evening to do anything I liked. Usually, we would have lunch after class time and go back to BK Dorm to take a nap till 3 p.m. And then, sometimes we went to the mall together, sometimes we just stayed in our own room, played guitar, sang, and told stories. And after 5p.m. , I went to the sports room and played table tennis with students in BKU. I met some new friends, they were all really kind and friendly. And it was my best holiday.

When I was a child, video games were launched. It was very exciting and it was considered an encouragement for neuromuscular and cerebral exercises. But they became very popular and sometimes took so much time from young people that they became a concern, not only for parents but also for educational professionals and public health. Some of those young people are so involved in video games that they forget their responsibilities, like studying and working. If they are not used so much but only for leisure, to enjoy time with friends, they are healthful. But the problem is that this is such a fine line. Beyond these problems, they increase the risk of obesity and its consequences. In my humble opinion, I think parents could establish some limits for their children, like allowing time for enjoying video games, but also time for their studying; they would also encourage physical activities or playing physical games.

In general, most students meet many different teachers throughout their student life, which I think is great because it helps them a lot. Firstly, dealing with various teachers will help students because they will learn different methods of studying, like for example, in mathematics. On the other hand, having the same teachers during many years can benefit pupils because they get used to their form of teaching, to the design of the exams, .... And also, they build up a better relationship between them. Another point is that meeting several teachers during their life will help young people to meet and get used to numerous personalities and cultures and that is such an important thing to keep in mind. In conclusion, I believe that it is really important for students to have new teachers each year, because they can learn so many methods of studying and they face different ways of thinking and distinct cultures, and that is as significant as the other subjects.

In this day and age, most of the time young people feel that the educational system is not suited to them. Some students can learn things very easily and find that they are not using their abilities to their fullest or the other way round. This second group of students cannot have good grades regardless of how much they study, as they do not have the capacity to make the most of it. If a school is considering these possibilities when giving the title of graduation to their students, they ought to be aware of the opportunities in the surroundings to better facilitate the connection between both sides. Youngsters sometimes have low self-esteem which makes it difficult for them to decide what to do, fearing the approach they have with others. As far as adults are concerned, they should stimulate creativity, giving youngsters tools to develop their integration, and last but not least, to help and motivate them to demonstrate their points of view. Clearly, this type of work will help young people not only to engage in society but also to develop their mindset. When learning by doing, people create intergenerational bonds, which are beneficial to get everyone closer to each other. Lest we forget that here is always the opportunity to find solutions for problems when there is solidarity. Bearing all this in mind, volunteering could create a space for alternative means of community support, it could also help the economic system and raise humanitarian values as there is no technical obligation. It would only require people to respect one another.

Understanding is one of the main concerns in teaching. NA,. there is a good relationship between a student and teacher that develops and they can understand each other's psychology. I think one teacher is sufficient to teach students well. I feel this way for two reasons which I wish to explore in this essay. Firstly, I would like to discuss the point of psychology. If people live together for a long time then they can very well understand each other's body language and way of giving a presentation or teaching . Grasping study material is not so easy if students are unable to understand the teacher's personality and it takes time to build this up between a student and teacher. If the same teacher for a long time then he could understand the that which subject or speciffic point to be focused more. Secondly, if the teacher is changed each year then he will teach students professionally.

All people want to see live animals, but it is not to easy to make plans for a jungle safari for most people due to many reasons, like insufficient time and money. My country is a developing country where spending money on a jungle safari is not easy for most of the public. If they want to enjoy seeing live wild animals, a zoo is the most appropriate option. There a person can enjoy the feeling of being in a forest in their own city . A zoo is one of the best picnic spots for not only kids, but also elderly people.

It's an interesting question. We have the same family and parents for our whole life. And it's important to build relationships based on respecting and loving each other. Regarding teachers it could be like that. But the question is that in our life we will have to relate to many kinds of people and their different personalities. So we need to have experiences with many different people in our childhood to strengthen our knowledge about relationships. Doing that, we would learn to respect others' opinions, understand their feelings, their cultures, and why they are so. Having different teachers in our life will contribute to having contact with different techniques, behaviour, and speakings. Another special point is empathy. So if you don't like someone you don't need to be with this same person each year. In my opinion, I think we have the right to know different people, so it's important to have different teachers each year.

There are 2 main reasons why there are few doctors in rural areas. First the total number of all doctors is not enough. If the problem was its imbalance, there would be many doctors who don't earn much money in cities. Seen from doctors' it is natural that they live and work in convenient places unless they have special reasons to go to rural areas. Next rural areas don't have many support systems so that doctors can keep working there. I think a good business is made from a good relationship. Once I heard the following news. A doctor went to a rural area to work there. This village has only 500 people. The locals the doctor and they ignored him. After all they couldn't communicate well and the doctor came to get a mental disease. The medical system collapsed. To solve this problem, cooperation between the government and a doctors' association is needed. Of course we should increase the number of doctors, but it is meaningless if the quality falls. And it is similarly important to spread the range of co-medical workers' jobs. It is quite important to do well as a team. It leads to more efficient work. Considering the specialities of doctors, government should assign doctors to specific areas. Having 'public' doctors may improve this situation.

I think that students benefit more from having new teachers every year, because students should be able to socialize with different kinds of teachers to improve their social skills. They need to learn different ways to solve problems, or to learn about another point of view from their different teachers. They also need to learn how to manage themselves with different kinds of teachers. The students should also be able to learn to work in different ways with different kinds of teachers, and they should be able to experience different kinds of teacher's, works, learnings, problem solving and a lot of things more. I think that for all these reasons, the kids should have different kinds of teachers every year to experience different things in different years so they can be more prepared to deal with different kinds of situations in the real world, so they can get through them.

I often use a laptop. There are various reasons that I use a laptop for. Firstly, I use a laptop for schoolwork. I am a university student, so I need my laptop a lot of times to write, for example, a report. But I also use my laptop to follow online lessons. Sometimes we use online books. Furthermore, I use my laptop to conduct research. In my school I have to write a lot of scientific reports, thus I have to execute online research to find the definition of some words or research that is related my subject and is conducted earlier. Secondly, I use my laptop to follow news, both Dutch and English news. At the moment there is a disease that has infected more than 1.5 million people around the world and the death toll of this disease is above 100,000. I use my laptop to be aware of all the news around this new infection that first emerged in the Chinese province Wuhan. This disease has had an enormous global impact. A lot of countries have chosen to shut down all public events, including restaurants and football matches. They also imposed significant measures in order to confine the spread of the virus. For example, people are strongly advised to stay home, only those who have vital work are allowed to go to work. Some countries, including the Netherlands, have decided to prohibit visiting nursing homes because this disease has most affected elderly people and those who have underlying health conditions. Lastly, a laptop helps me to find online tasks that I can use to enhance my English level. On internet there are a lot of sites which provide English lessons. Furthermore, I use my laptop to watch films via YouTube or Netflix.

In some offices, employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles. It is like this in my work place. These types of offices have different advantages. All units work different areas or offices.

In fact these office types depend on your job or sector. The office design depends on your work sector. Some jobs need silence, like accounting or finance jobs.

I agree with the opinion that high schools impose on students to attend a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate because students can grow up through volunteer work experience. Of course I know some objections: that it is far away from its essence to make students take part in volunteer work as a requirement of graduation. It is the best to do it from their spontaneous volunteer spirit. But why schools dare to do so is that they have certain thoughts that volunteer work is definitely good for students' life. When I was in high school, I took part in volunteer work as a kindergarten teacher. It was really fun to play with kids. But I felt some kind of difficulty. And I thought that it was quite tough to smile all the day as a professional. Generally the salary of kindergarten teachers is not high. I really felt their professional spirit and their job ethic. To experience outside of your world through volunteer work, you can realize how small your place which you usually live in is. This discovery is the most precious for you. There is a saying in Japan, "No matter how much you may spend money, you should experience various difficulties or troubles." An experience is a treasure. I think it is good for students that schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate because it may be a trigger to realize something.

In contemporary society, volunteer certification is considered as a compulsory requirement for students to graduate in some high schools, which remains a compulsory requirement for students to graduate in some high school, which remains a highly continuous public discourse. I strongly believe that although there are many benefits that this trend has brought to students, its drawbacks should not be ignored. On the one hand, volunteer work plays an essential role in helping youngsters not only develop their social relationships but also become more active and sympathetic. Nowadays, adolescents live in a close- knit family with high standard of living, so some of them might not understand the difficulties the poor have to experience. Becoming a volunteer will get youngsters out of their comfort vibe because they have a chance to do something that they have never done before: help the elderly and the disabled, such as collecting old stuff, raising funds, teaching disabled children at an orphanage, etc. Thanks to these activities, students can broaden their mind and know how to get on well with other people, no matter where they are from. Moreover, teenagers also become more empathetic towards their parents and appreciate the time all members live together. The Green Summer is a good illustration of volunteer work in Viet Nam, which attracts millions of students every year with many unforgettable experiences. On the other hand, those whose argument revolves around the disadvantages of obligatory volunteer certification might contend that students can only receive real value when they participate in volunteering without being required. It is undeniable that some volunteers feel exhausted after doing volunteer work and they just think about their graduation certificate, in lieu of the precious value of volunteering, thereby not able to focus on helping communities. As a result, helping communities to get over the obstacles in life indeliberately becomes a tedious task for youngsters, instead of useful work for developing both knowledge and a positive personality. In conclusion, the rise of compulsory volunteering has both advantages and disadvantages. From a personal perspective, the aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for me to believe that the downsides of this trend outweigh its upsides and more encouragement should be made by schools and society to interest students in volunteer work.

I think it is good that children play video games because with certain types of video games the children may get some skills by playing video games. Like they may be faster at reacting if something doesn't seems right, or lots of other things. But if children play video games that are not appropriate for their age, or when some of the video games that the children play contain violence that the children are not supposed to watch, contain violence thst the children are not supposed to watch. Also, there are some types of video games that challenge the children's minds by asking them challenging questions, or giving them a mystery to solve and ask what they would do if they were in some type of tricky situation. If there is a video game with all the characteristics that I mentioned, but the video game is not appropriate for your child's age it is best that you don't buy it. That is my opinion.

I think that in some part it is good to keep animals in zoos because some of the animals are endangered species. By keeping these endangered animals in zoos we may help them not go extinct, and when there are lots more animals of this kind the animals can return to their habitat. Although the animals should be free to stay in their habitat and have a special area where they cannot be hunted by hunters. Also, zoos should provide more space for their animals so they can be happier. Zoos should provide enough food for their animals to eat. Zoos must clean the animals' cages so they can't get sick. Zoos also have to clean up their animals' poop. If these measures are taken then the animals should be happy. That is my opinion about animals that are kept in zoos.

As you know, I am a great admirer of his music and when I got to know it was organized in my place in Bangalore, I could not miss it. There were many famous musicians who performed at the concert. To mention a few, there was Ramesh, the renowned drummer, Sundar the pianist, and many others. All musicians performed at their best and made the evening a memorable one. On a few occasions, members of the audience performed along with the musicians. It was indeed a treat to our ears and eyes. Hope to meet you soon. All the best, Akila

At this time of an unequal world, a big round of applause must be given to front-line volunteers who have been battling poverty and the health issues for underprivileged people. We are in desperate need of more volunteers in order to continue the fight and win this poverty war. Forcing high schools to complete the volunteer work might increase the number of volunteers in the short run, however, it is not sustainable in the long run. This requirement can impose students to take positive action for their community, but it can't highlight their concern over the struggle of the underprivileged in their community to cope with the worsening air pollution, drought and hunger. Forcing students without educating them about volunteer work can mark a new point of conflict. They will solve the problem without emphasizing the beneficial living conditions. I suggest the school should initiate a volunteer course. This course will make the students believe and interested in the volunteers' work story given out by guest teachers who have adopted volunteer work in their routine life. This course will mention possible ways to start volunteer work easily. If the students are educated, it will be easy to convince them to put small steps in action. To make the volunteer work contagious, the school needs a wisely communicated campaign and intriguing reward. The school might offer certificates for those who have finished this volunteer course. This purpose of this course is to mitigate the damage from misunderstanding action. Enlightening them about the value of volunteer work instead of imposing it as a school requirement seems to be an effective and sustainable approach to ensure that every student can access a set of knowledge before taking on meaningful work for others.

My town is relatively quiet. We have some landmarks, an urban lagoon, a statue of Christ on the top of a mountain, which is very common in Brazil. We don't have big stores to shop in, but small stores, with everything that you need. Unhappily, we don't have museums, but the town has good restaurants to go out to at night and meet friends.

The trend of globalization increases every day. It's an important dominant if you know as many foreign languages as possible. It reveals that the ability to speak a foreign language is one of the main elements to be development and succeed socially nowadays. But in the past, learning to speak a foreign language was not as important as it is these days. Commerce just happened in a small area where they spoke the same language. Learning a foreign language was not popular and there were not many foreign language teachers, so if you wanted to learn a new language, it was extremely hard and expensive. People didn't have any demand to deal with foreigners or travel to another country, so they didn't have any reason to learn a new language. Only when the world war happened, European countries, like England, France, Germany, Italy, and some other countries, like America and Japan were strengthen colonial aggression, learning foreign languages just started to get focused.

Obviously, to perform optimally, an office should provide a quiet and calm workspace, so that the employees can focus on their jobs and they won't be distracted during work time. Therefore, closed workstations or cubicles seem like the perfect solution to optimise the employees' performances. On the other hand, how long can you really stay focussed on your own in a boring room? Employees in enclosed workstations often catch themselves staring at a blank wall, while people in open floorplan designed offices are more motivated to work. The reason for this is that seeing other people work is very motivating and increases your own productivity. Despite the fact that there is more noise and employees can easily get distracted because of small talk and chats with co-workers, they will probably work harder than they would in an enclosed workspace. In addition to this, it is easier for the boss or manager to check in on his employees in an open office, since they can just walk through the workspace. The employees will feel more pressure to continue to work when they know they are being watched, whereas the temptation to play a game on your computer in the enclosed workspace, since no one notices anyway, is much bigger. To summarize, an enclosed workspace might seem to improve employees' productivity at first sight, but in my opinion, an open office is more effective. A little chat once in a while is not that bad, as long as employees are inspired and motivated most of the time.

Hi Teacher! So far, I have liked Write and Improve. It has really helped me better my writing and I have learnt some new vocabulary. I now know how to use certain words to say certain things, I know how to write some words that I had problems memorizing, I know how to use dots, commas, a colon, and a bunch of other punctuation marks. What I didn't like about Write and Improve was that I have to write a lot of words, and I don't know what more to write about! Sometimes I don't understand why the program says that some of the words are wrong, but I search for them and they're right. And sometimes I write about what I am supposed to write and it says that I should have written about what it told me to write. I would recommend it to my classmates, it is a really good program.

How employees feel at work is becoming a main focus nowadays. Managers admit that workers are more effective when they feel comfortable at work, and in recent years have wondered how to make it happen. In order to make workers comfortable, a lot have ideas that have seen the light. New work organisations have appeared, like homeworking, new open spaces, relaxation rooms, and many more. In my opinion, all of these arrangements are an excellent thing. The new open spaces are one of the best ideas of these new organisations. First, open spaces brought coworkers the chance to communicate much more. They are now able to exchange information much more easily than before. In cubicles people had to phone their coworkers or go to their desk in order to give them information. Also, open spaces is a good way to reinforce team building, and to create an even stronger team spirit. When people are in enclosed workstations, they easy can forget they are a team. With open spaces relationships between co-workers are stronger. Of course, open spaces can offer some difficulties for some employees. Some people find it too noisy and are having trouble concentrating on their work. Other people will regret their intimacy, and might feel uncomfortable in a space with no walls. For the first difficulty, employees can use headphones to reduce the noise, and not be disturbed for a period of time. For the second difficulty, it's up to every employee to decorate their desk with photos, or souvenirs to make it more intimate. Regarding these different points, I believe open spaces are a great new way to organize the workplace and should be encouraged.

I think that the advantages of studying in another country are that you get to visit other countries, you can learn new traditions or cultures, you get to learn other languages apart from the ones you already know, and you can learn in different ways from the ones you learnt in your own country. You can make new friends and visit lots of the touristic places in the country you're visiting. The disadvantages of studying abroad are that going to study in another country is expensive, you are going to leave your friends and family, you have to buy hotel tickets, get a scholarship, or stay with a host family in the country you want to study in. You need to be responsible while you are staying with your host family and you need to behave with your host family. That is my opinion of the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad.

Nowadays, more and more people learn foreign languages. They need it for a better job and travelling abroad. In my opinion, it is very important to speak a foreign language; it's as important these days as it was in the past. Firstly, we need language to communicate with each other. Knowledge of grammar rules improves these skills. What's more, in the past knowing a foreign language helped to survive during the war. If you knew the language of your enemy, you could rescue your family. Secondly, in the past, somebody who knew a foreign language very well, could earn a good salary. Because of a lack of books and money not many people were able to learn to speak a foreign language. As a result, they could find a better job than ordinary people. These days we can observe a similar situation. Many employers are looking for people who can speak a foreign language fluently. Lastly, people who know a foreign language very well are always better travelers than people who know only their mother tongue. To sum up, learning speaking skills was and is the main reason why people learn a new language. They want to communicate.

As per my opinion, I don't think students need to do some specific work because then it will be unfair for the students who have got less work, if you really want to do this type of work. The same work with the same topics is given to every child. To graduate you do need to do some work and this could be one of the ideas which could be chosen by the school. Overall, I would nether say yes or no for this statement because there can be advantages and disadvantages on both sides. I could also say yes to this statement because you need to do some hard work to get something. You can't just sit there with no work done and say I graduated, so you do need to do some volunteer work in order to graduate and achieve what you want. You can choose any one of the options from the school authority.

Yes, I highly agree with the statement because physical and other activities are as equally important as studies. They are very important because only studies can make the students' brain a bit annoying, and if someone is highly educated he should have some other qualities which can impress people. Musical training helps develop language and reasoning. Students who have early musical training will develop the areas of the brain related to language and reasoning. The left side of the brain is better developed with music, and songs can help imprint information on young minds. It helps the brain more creative ideas as the person becomes a professional player in playing music. This can make the brain development better for the person and it works even faster. This means that it will make him intelligent in all ways. If the students are only taught only one thing their brain can be damaged by having so much information about only one thing.

Nowadays, a lot of students choose to study abroad in countries with another language and culture, which I think is a great educative and unforgettable experience to live. Firstly, studying in another country for a year or even some months will benefit students by giving them a great deal of knowledge and experience of a language and the traditions of a country. Because while they are learning and studying at a high school or university, they are also discovering the way of thinking and life in a completely different country. On the other hand, being an exchange student can be not as exciting as it seems. For example, if a student is too shy , he can find adapting to a new country a very harsh experience. Also, they can feel homesick, which can be harmful for their school course. A further point is the fact of travelling alone; at first you find yourself alone in a place you have never been to. It's also a great chance for young boys to become more independent, learn how to look after themselves, and also to meet and make new friends. In conclusion, despite some disadvantages that doing an exchange year in another country might bring, I believe that if someone has the opportunity, he must take it. Because I bet it will be an astonishing year, which in addition to making you learn a lot, will change your life completely.

Nowadays, people who live in the affluent countries are getting older. Therefore, the demand for the medical access is increasing swiftly. However, there are fewer medical doctors in the rural areas compared with cities. There are various reasons why a medical doctor prefers to work in a city than a rural area according to different research that is executed by different European medical hospitals. First of all, research that is conducted by Erasmuc MC in the Netherlands shows that medical doctors prefer to work in cities because of their family. Both their spouses and their children are against living in a small city. Moreover, it turns out that the partner of a medical doctor has a job that is settled in a city. Secondly, there are problems associated with transport. The roads in a lot of wealthy countries is getting busier, so the traffic jams are increasing rapidly in those countries. This problem daunted the medical doctors to work in rural areas. Many medical doctors show that they are willing to work in a rural areas, however they avoid these areas due to the traffic jams. On the other hand, the research indicates that there are medical doctors who avoid working in rural areas because the care demand in a rural area is lower than the demand in a city. In a big cities there are a lot of people , therefore there are a lot of people who visit the medical doctor. To summarize, a medical doctor will earn more money if he or she works in a city than a rural area. To solve this problem the government has to encourage the use of public transport. If the people who work for other sectors used more public transport instead of cars, the traffic jams would decrease. This will make it easier for the medical doctors to travel from a city to a rural area. Another solution would be that the health insurance companies pay more to those working in rural areas to encourage the medical doctors to work in a rural area.

INTRODUCTION Telling the truth has been an issue that has been always argued about for centuries, and all men have always wondered about the importance of it. Poets, philosophers, musicians and, more generally, every kind of artist have posed the question. However, I think that neither themselves nor their audience can give en exhaustive answer. WHAT IS THAT? In accordance with some of the most prestigious philosophical theories, we cannot find a precise statement to sum up what truth is, in other words, they argue that truth does not exist. To be more precise they assume that there is not only a single truth, but thousands or billions of examples of it. Everyone of us knows what is real for him and the underlying reasons that lead him to believe in something. EXAMPLES As I see it, not always telling the truth is the best thing to do, in the same cases a lie is a way to protect people, especially our dearest and nearest. On the other hand, every one of us should be intuitive enough to know when the moment is to lie or tell the truth, and above all recognise who is ready to accept a difficult and harmful truth even when it could convey a big sorrow. Some examples can be related to relationships or diseases where your doubts do not let you decide what is better for others. CONCLUSIONS As I said before, we require a large quantity of braveness, but also a sharp spirit of observation to decide when the moment to speak clearly is.

Learning English is for our future. I have seen an article and it says that learning a new language can develop and bright your brain.

It is very important for me to learn English because I want to follow a career in languages, I like them very much, especially English. English is spoken in a lot of countries and by a lot of people and this is our advantage, because we can visit many countries if we speak English. I think we have enough time to learn a language.

My favourite season of the year My favourite season of the year is summer. Even though I was born in the autumn, I like summer more. In this season we can go on holiday to the sea, or mountains, and everywhere you want. We don' t have to go to school anymore, so we can relax our brain for three months. We can spend more time with our friends and family. We have a lot of time to take care of ourselves, read a book, watch a film, be fit, and do our workout. There are a few reasons I like summer the most. It is very special for me because when I was younger, I was very happy when it was summer.

The purpose of this report is to tell you about my writing experience with Write and Improve. Firstly, I really appreciate how fast Write and Improve can check my work, give feedback and evaluate my writing skills. Another fact to consider is this program is totally free therefore everybody can use it, and I must also mention that I can use this program at any time, which means I can practise my writing as much as I want. However, in spite of the fact that it is well-programmed, I would rather have a person who can give more advice and explanation, even though it is already clear, such as examples or synonyms. To sum up, I have no hesitation in recommending Write and Improve to my friends, because it really helps me to improve my English and be more confident in using English words. Otherwise, this would not improve.

You will not believe that one of the most important holidays I have ever had was the one when my sister got married and I was the bridesmaid. It was in Thailand and believe it or not, there is nothing in the world like this wedding. For a start, the organisation was well-planned. Every detail was perfectly neat, such as the choice of flowers and meals. I must also mention that there was an orchestra for the reception. The music was chosen by the bride and it was full of emotion, particularly for my parents. Apart from that, the theme of the wedding was about Thailand, therefore, all guests were wearing traditional costumes and it was proudful. Personally, I believe that my sister's wedding was one of the best holidays I have ever had because it was full of joy and tears. Unfortunately, I had to get back to Switzerland two days later, but I will remember that party forever.

There was a giant chessboard game also, there was a big pool, and a restaurant that let you choose whatever you wanted to eat; I got ice cream every day at every meal! We ate tacos, chicken nuggets, and other Mexican dishes. I also collected seashells. We swam with dolphins! It was really fun, we even got a memory photo to take home. It was sad to leave that marvelous place. We got on an airplane and ate some snacks on the way home. It was an amazing experience, I hope to go back to the beach soon and return to this hotel.

To get a proper education is a must for everyone and wherever you can get a good education you should join an education centre, whether it is in your country or not. I have two chief reasons to support my view, which I wish to explore in this essay. Firstly, I would like to say that good education is a fundamental right of everyone and everyone is free to take education anywhere as per his circumstances and rule regulation. Nowadays, every one is getting an excellent education for a job and updated better carrier. If you want to do a good job you have to prove your skills and as we know these days there is a fierce competition. If you are not well educated and excellent in your area/subject you can't do an interview well. Hence a good academic education is a must. One example I would like to discuss is that one of my younger brothers is doing a job in an American company as an economic advisor with a good salary package in India because he got his education at an Oxford business school and his thinking is very clear on the wake of economics that which step is good.

There have been a lot of proven studies that an open space office is better than enclosed workstations or cubicles. Furthermore, there have also been articles about the advantages and disadvantages regarding open space offices. First of all, I would like to write briefly about enclosed workstations or basically offices with a lot of walls to separate the employees from each other. A cubicle is mostly a small and quite dark room. If the employee is standing, he might see over the walls. As soon as the employee is sitting at his desk he will not see over the top of the cubicle wall. You might feel a bit claustrophobic. In worst case, there will be no welcoming and bright sunlight around you. Besides dark walls and the feeling of being in a cage like an animal, people may also get easily distracted. No one would notice if you are on your phone playing games or buying clothes online. This provides us with the conclusion that an open space office is the better solution for the employees and the whole company. Beginning with the sunlight around everybody and no dark walls around you and your co-workers, people can be more productive if they see how hard their co-workers are working. It is true that you will have more noises around you because of the other people. But there are a lot of solutions to provide quiet surroundings. People can listen to music or attach little walls around their desks. These walls help to minimise the noises around you but do not cover the whole view of the person sitting at the desk. The final reason is socialising with the co-workers. All employees will have a strong bond, if there are no dark walls surrounding them.

Here in Italy, we go to school for thirteen years, so we have the chance to meet a lot of different teachers. I don't think students can benefit from having new teachers every year, but neither from having the same one for their whole school life. The best choice is always the one in the middle: having the same teachers for a limited period. Having new teachers every year would mean changing methods too often and there would be no continuity of the work done the previous year. Moreover, students and teachers wouldn't be able to build a lasting and solid connection. On the other hand, keeping the same teachers for all school years could become a limiting factor. Different people can offer different methods and perspectives. Remaining together for ten years could mean creating a connection which goes beyond the limits of a student-teacher connection. The best option is staying together for several years; in this way students and teachers get to know each other and to cooperate together, and completing a school program becomes easier.

My computer is my tool for working and I guess it's the same for many millions of workers and people in the world. Computers are essential in many areas. Today, flights, machines in industries, labs and, sometimes, health services are driven by computers. Many people trust schedules recorded on computers. They make knowledge available and spread it through writing, speaking and videos. We can even study and work on computers. Computers have more potential than our brains so using them is amazing but worrying.

There has been an ongoing debate around enclosed workstations versus open design. Open offices tend to enable collaboration while enclosed spaces tend to encourage more focus. However, every space has been designed for a specific purpose, like our house where the living room is an open space for family gatherings while our bedroom is an enclosed space for private activity. Office should be designed in the same way. Employees do many activities in the office. Clearly not all of these activities are effectively done in a single type of a space. This is the main reason why I support the company making multipurpose working spaces. Meetings and training might need an open space for enhancing collaboration and discussion. On the other hand, cubicles will be a peaceful space for doing complicated work which needs a deep focus. Diversifying the environment of a working space will give the employees the choice to choose the space for completing their specific task in a productive way. Well-designed working spaces can increase creativity, innovation and proficiency in the company. In my opinion, I would suggest combining the cubicles and open spaces because every employee has their own preference. Let them choose their working environment to deliver a highly productive task. Many innovative offices make a radical change by offering their employees non-fixed seats. Employees can freely choose to work in a quiet room, garden, kitchen, co-working space or any spaces that they feel comfortable working in. Unbelievably, the variety of working spaces can promote employees' productivity when the office is designed based on collective data.

Schooling is a big part of someone's life. During this time you meet a lot of people: teachers, friends, supervisors, and more. Some will come into your life and will never leave, while others will follow their own path. On this journey, some people will have the same teacher for several years, while others will have new teachers each year. In my opinion, having different teachers each year is the best way to collect new skills and to learn from different places. Everyone is unique, and every teacher also is. Having a new teacher each year will give you new skills and will help you to develop yourself in different manners. Also, having a new teacher each year is the best way to confront students with real life. When you go to work, you will meet a lot of different people with different attitudes. Meeting different authority figures when you are studying is a very good way to prepare the future. Another main point is adaptation. Changing teachers will help young people to be adaptive in different situations. I might be 100% sure it is better for students, but I also understand the disadvantages of changing teachers each year. First, some children need time to get used to someone. And for this kind of people changing each year is very challenging. They might even suffer from this turn-over, and see it as if they were abandoned by their teachers. Also, for students that have been developing a trustworthy relationship with their teachers, they could be more motivated for their work if they have the same teacher each year. Anyway, there are a lot of sensibilities, and my opinion is not a sure thing, even if I believe in my reasons.

Hi Cristina, I'm really sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you. It's just awful to hear about your accident. I hope it wasn't too serious. If you want any help you can call me at any time, such as carrying bags or cleaning your apartment. I can probably come to your place this evening but I have to go to the supermarket first. Anyway, I must dash now. See you! All the best, Donlaya

We live in an age when most of us have a bad lifestyle. Not because we do not exercise, but it is because we eat a lot of junk foods, which involves a bad health condition. There are some reasons that I can explain this statement with. First, people can do exercise inside their own house without going out whenever they want even though sometimes they are poorly equipped. Even,. you have to drive or walk to the gym to do some exercise, which means you still have to go out. Secondly, exercising outside your house can have its benefits, such as taking some fresh air. But on the other hand, you cannot do it all the time, for example, in the case of bad weather. Therefore, an indoor workout is not that bad. Another thing to consider is that eating healthy food can keep us fit without doing any exercise. However, healthy food can cost a lot. When it comes to eating healthy food, we have to provide the ingredients ourselves. To sum up, doing exercise is not a bad thing. But you need to have time. For me, I prefer eating healthily.

From my point of view, 60 percent of the teaching process depends on the way that a teacher presents the materials and lessons. What strategies he uses and what exercises and methods to navigates ths benefits of the course. In addition, how he makes an assessment of the students to make sure they are understanding the lessons. Second, 40 percent revolves around the teacher, the charisma and the techniques he provides to attract the attention of the students. In my opinion, it is not about the years the teacher teaches them or having a new teacher in each year. Many students tend to a good teacher reputation. Also, the views of his learners. Are they satisfied regarding his teaching or frustrated because of him? the scores the students got when he taught them. Obviously, it is more than the teacher, it is got when he taught them. obviously it is more than the teacher it is learning organziation, teaching procedures and skilled teacher in the end of the circle.

Nowadays, the computer is very popular. It plays an important role in our life. Like other people, especially teenagers, I usually use a computer. I use it 2-3 times a day. The computer has a lot of functions that make it becomes popular. Firstly, we can use it to study. We can study online on the Internet and study by ourselves through many websites. Secondly, we can read a lot of newspapers or magazines without going to buy them every day. The computer is very useful, right? Thirdly, the computer is also a device for us to relax. We can watch a lot of films and movies on the screen of the computer, or listen to the music we like or chat with our friends. Sometimes, we can call by video to someone we love. In my opinion, what I enjoy doing most with a computer is studying. I can learn a lot of things and lessons are extremely useful all the time. The computer has many benefits but don't abuse it and depend on it much.

My favourite season of the year is summer. Summer is special for me because I was born in this season and my family, too. I love summer because of the warm weather, the school vacation, and the endless fun. I really enjoy the warm weather because it’s the perfect atmosphere to do outdoor activities. My favorite part about summer has to be the fact that school is closed for two months. During summer, you’re free to do whatever you want, not worrying about curfew or waking up early for school. Summer time is a great time to relax with friends and family by soaking up the sun at a beach or simply having dinner together. Also, another fact why I like summer is because I'm a tennis player and the season starts in summer so I can go to tournaments, meet new people, and play tennis with them. This is my favourite part of the year, what's yours?

I think animals belong in nature. The idea of forcing animals to live outside their natural environment is not good to me. If we want to learn about them we could prepare and adapt natural places. We could enjoy a safari too. There are different things we could do to enjoy them and learn about them. I firmly believe those animals suffer in captivity. Why make them suffer? The answer based on the learning experience isn't to my liking. In the end, these zoos are businesses. Should we trade with these animals' feelings? I don´t think so. I think we could do better as a society and we should respect their place in the world. Our children and scientists would agree with a different way to manage this situation for sure. Please, let them enjoy themselves and live free in their environment. This is the only way we can grow as a society.

Learning can be difficult if we don't use appropriate tools. For example, learning English with many tools at the same time will make learners confused. Different tools have different unique features. This text is a suggestion to learn English using a web-based tool, namely, Write and Improve. Write and Improve is an English learning tool developed by Cambridge University. It has many features which allow English learners to get the most benefit from the tool. At first, it invites the learner to write in English on broad topics within different levels, from beginner to business level. It also offers a preparation for IELTS test, a test that is used for University entrance in some Commonwealth countries. The learners can create their own workbook or join other workbooks. This feature also can be used for English teachers to share homework with their students and to make online assessments. Let's take a more detail example. When learners enter a Write and Improve workbook, for instance at the beginner level, they are asked to choose a topic and write an article (which can be a review, summary, or argumentation) for that topic. Write and Improve (W&I) requires minimum word numbers to qualify a task is done. When learners accomplish this requirement, they can submit their work by clicking the "Check" button. W&I will assess that work and give feedback. The learners can revise their writing based on the given feedback and submit it again to obtain such improvements. W&I will show the score of writing sequentially.

As the new year starts, I have a few resolutions to make. First, I have to say that I am pretty satisfied with my school performance in general. Especially subjects like accounting, math, and informatics are the ones in which I am on top already. The minor subjects could not work better either. I am a very ambitious student. That is why my grades are always As. On the other hand, improvements are still possible. Language courses are the ones that would need the most improvement from my point of view. I would really like to be able to speak unprepared on every topic that may come up. Moreover, I also want to focus on grammar structures and my writing skills. In order to reach these goals, I intend to revise every day, using the help of certain online platforms. Aside from this, I really want to keep up the work I already do for school. Never give up!

In my opinion, offices in separate rooms are more comfortable than offices where most employees are in one room. Indeed, it is easier to help each other, but if an number of your colleagues have to call important partners of the company the whole time, it can be really disturbing. Therefore, employees are not able to focus and concentrate on their own work and that is very inconvenient. Due the fact that the most people are working slower and more carelessly while they are being disturbed, not only the company suffers from it, but also the staff themselves. For instance, my dad is a clerk in a company, where all employees work in one room and he describes the situation as very uncomfortable and annoying, because his colleagues are on the phone the whole day. It takes him twice as long to finish his projects now. To put it in a nutshell, an office with an open design is not quite right for employees who have to focus on their own work.

I think that it is better to work in enclosed workstations for different reasons. First of all, it can be very destructive if there are no walls between the different offices. There are employees who prefer to work in a calm environment. It is very important to protect those employees and give them the right to work a suitable environment. Furthermore, not all employees in a company conduct the same work, so it is illogical to put all the employees in an open office. Secondly, because of the new Coronavirus it is very important to maintain the social distancing rules. To preserve this rule, workstations would be a good idea. I know there are people who are thinking that the new virus would last a limited time. However, the medical specialists are saying the likelihood that we get a new virus like this is significantly high. Moreover, there are companies who are struggling to maintain this rule, because of the open design. As we know it will last a minimum of 12 months to develop a vaccine, and the question would be if the vaccine would work.

I like to play table tennis because you need faster movements than your opponent to get points, which makes this sport a quite dynamic game.

I think that the future of travel is going to be less polluting for the environment. I think that soon we are going to have flying cars and robots that are going to tell us to stop. All of the usual things that we are doing today are going to be done by robots. I don't think that human beings can be replaced by robots, I don't think that is a good idea. We don't know what they are capable of. I don't trust robots with artificial intelligence. So I think the best thing to do is to keep our head on our shoulders, to try to think more about the dangers and less about the money, to think more about the humans and less about some bills. I think that our safety is more important than what robots can offer us. I think that what recommends them is the speed, the fact that they will not be paid, that they won't be late for work, and that they are never tired.

I think that this subject is a very boring one. I just woke up and my head is full of other stuff. I think that the "School of the Future" is going to change. Some of our schools have already changed, some of them have improved their teaching methods, some have invested lots of money in order to improve and make education easier for their students. The only problem is the big difference between the levels of the schools. Some schools have invested lots of money and are using technology to get closer to their students. For example, in Romania we still don't have toilets in most of our schools. We still don't have drinking water in our schools. We still pay for our education, even if the government should pay for it. So first I think we should change the people that are responsible for those things, then invest in education.

I think that the first purpose of television was to bring information closer to people. After a period, the TV channels started to produce entertainment, videos, and movies. There are a couple of channels that can bring education closer to the audience, but most of them are used to control the masses. A couple of them are TV news channels, other are specialized only in playing movies, and there are a couple of channels that are doing all in one. The most-watched channel in Romania I think is Pro TV. It is one of the oldest channels. Sometimes I watch Digi TV, but most of the times I watch movies on Netflix. As you know, Netflix is an online platform that gives you access to hundreds of online movies, the only condition is to pay your monthly bill.

In my opinion, I think a zoo is a good place to let people learn about animals. For example, families take their children to the zoo. Also, schools take their students to gain information about animals, because of the high level of safety and security. But In other words the way to protect animals' rights and people's rights is by putting animals in the zoo during a specific period of time to let people see them and take pictures to learn, or whatever. The reason is if we allowed people to visit animals in their habitat or forest it would be dangerous to their life, due to there not being any barriers or cages to prevent an attack by animals, and the rate of risk is too high. To find a good solution and create a balance between that is letting the animals live in their place and create a schedule to transfer them to a zoo to be available for visits by families and schools.

Video games are a double-edged sword. If we use them in the right way, is allowed to the children play 1 to 2 hours of video games. The advantage of video games is that they allow children to interact with an electronic device and learn the basic words and steps of using any electronic device. Also they can be of assistance to parents using the video games as a reinforcement if their son or daughter completes their homework or task. The disadvantage of using video games is that they allow children to sit for a long period of time, without tell them what the consequences of that. Like eye problems and the stress on their bodies,, and a lack of concentration. In my opinion, to create a balance, it is necessary to create an activity schedule for children to manage their time and distribute the activities over specific periods of time during the day. Furthermore, take into consideration the priorties what should they spend the most of their time on it.

If I had to choose between money or my health I would chose my health. Money is not so important if you can't enjoy it, if you don't have time to spend it. I think that we should keep a balance between work and our personal life. Life is too short just to make money, life is passing by and no fortune can buy it back. I think that the biggest fortune is our health. If we lose it, it's very hard to get it back. The strange thing is that people are running after money all their lives and after they have it they are using it to be healthy again. Then they are running again after money, but this time they can't get their health back. After that, most of them are dying and have many regrets about how they lived their lives. I think our biggest treasure is our health and we should try our best to keep it.

Studying at university is a challenging time for both parents and children. Very often children have to move from their parents' because a university is in another city, whereas children who live in a big city, where they have their university, decide to stay at home with their parents. However, sometimes even if the university is in the same city, children prefer living without parents. In my view a better choice is to live without parents while children are attending university. First of all, this is an excellent opportunity to help children to mature. Children start to live on their own and they have to take responsibility for their decisions and choices. They can ask their parents for advice, obviously. But they have to dot their i's. And another thing is the fact that, as we know, students' life is a time when children get to know new friends. In consequence, children want to invite new people to their house, for instance to a party. Therefore, it's more comfortable to invite them to their own house not to their parents' house. Without a doubt, a more enjoyable meeting is with age - mates. Nevertheless, as we know, there are two sides of every story. In a results, living with parents during studying has a positive side too. While children are students and live with their family, they needn't worry about many things such as money. After all, not everybody needs a free house to invite many friends to. In summary, I honestly believe that is better to move away during studying time. It's a start of new, independent, adult life. Everybody ought to have time to grow up and mature. To me, the best time for that is studying time, exactly.

It is maybe the most challenging decision for every student to find the university where they want to study. Besides the question of what they want to study, they will also question themselves where they want to study and, last but not least, where they want to live. After the students have successfully applied for a university, they might need to move out. Luckily there are plenty of options where they can live. For some students the campus life will be their first choice, because they need other students around them. They like to share a bedroom and spend as much time as possible with other people. On the other hand, there are also cozy single bedroom apartments near universities. Some students are more introvert and do not like to have a crowd of other students around them. However, living on your own will help you also learn how to take care of yourself. There will be no mom, who cooks a nourishing lunch for you or washes your stinky, dirty socks. This will be all part of your experience. You will learn how to deal with it and it will be the best time of your life! Your family will always be by your side and they will also support you.

Today, video games have divided the population into two sides. The first side is made up of people who think that video games have a negative impact on children and adults, while the second one is made up of people who think that video games are a thing that can allow you to be whoever you want. Honestly, I'm in the second group because I think that video games are not negative. There are negative aspects if you play for too long. For example, playing 10 hours or longer without taking a break can do serious damage to children. This is the true problem. I do not know why some people think that video games are dangerous, but everyone is free to say whatever he wants. There are so many scientific studies showing the benefits of playing video games, such as letting you make difficult decisions in less time, or maybe making your eyes more powerful. By this I mean the ability to see more things moving etc... However, there are negative effects. As I said before, playing for too long can have a negative impact. It can make people have bad eyesight or suffer from strong headaches. Personally, I love video games. They let me go to places where I cannot go, do things that normal people can only dream of. I consider them a playable book.

A teacher is an important professional in the school environment. They are an important entity because they can teach you many important things. In my opinion, on one hand, having the same teacher every year is a good thing because this allows a student to study without problems. On the other hand, having a different teacher every year makes things more difficult for a student because he has a different method. I remember when I was in the second year of high school, my French teacher changed. So my classmates and I were very disappointed because we had to learn French differently. Our new teacher was strict, but also fair. We liked her, but 2 years later she left her job because her husband died. Then we had a different teacher, but we had a lot of problems with her because she made things too easy. Our grades were high, but our skills were very poor. In conclusion, I think that having the same teacher is better.

I think that doing exercise is important, but there are some more important things like, a wedding, your kid's ceremony, or a ceremony of a loved one. Or do you prefer to do exercise rather than attend those important events? It is better to attend those very important events to show that you care. When you have free time you can do exercise, you can do sports with your children, which is doing exercise, and you can do a competition to make it more fun. Also, it is very important to exercise because it is important for our health to keep a healthy body and a healthy mind. You need to do exercise when you have free time to be healthy. You can also enjoy exercise by listening to your favourite podcast or music. I think it is better to attend special events than doing exercise, but you should do exercise when you can.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Volunteer work can offer a large range of diversity. It can be to help homeless people, to teach a language to foreigners, or to pick up trash on the beach. They don't need to be in a large non-governmental organisation to discover what volunteer work is. Students will encounter many opportunities, and can choose a realm which they feel comfortable in. High school is a period where children become adults and are questioning their beliefs and opinions. In my opinion, that's an excellent idea for many reasons. Volunteer work presents many advantages for students. First, it's work experience. And as any work experience it will help students to develop new skills and to build a professional network. Secondly, some teenagers might discover a new interest while working as a volunteer, and find their path. Finally, volunteer work will lead young adults to meet people in need and will make them realise in which society they are living. It will open their minds, and their beliefs, and it will help them to become more responsible adults. Even though I believe that's a great initiative, I think it might be difficult for young adults to manage their time. High school is already very demanding in terms of homework, adding volunteer work can lead them to some difficulties. The lack of free time can be very stressful for some teenagers. High schools demanding a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate must keep in mind these difficulties. Nevertheless, I am convinced that's a great idea.

Whether people should always tell the truth in any situations remains a highly continuous public discourse. Although it is undeniable that honesty is a worthwhile policy, I strongly believe that in some circumstances, not revealing the truth is an effective choice to protect both speakers and listeners. On the one hand, honesty is a valuable personality that everyone should have in order to archive a better life. In contemporary society, people are likely to broaden their horizons and develop their soft skills by working with people. This fact has demonstrated that people can only co-operate one another through trust and honesty, which play an essential role in building a long-term relationship. Honest people will never flatter another and make progress by their own qualification. Moreover, telling the truth is considered as one of the most effective ways to not only increase understanding and sympathy among people but also help people respect and appreciate differences of others. Therefore, many companies today choose employees who are both qualified and reliable because they believe that these people will become powerful workforces for the development of society. On the other hand, in some situations, lying is a better method to keep a relationship and avoid hurting one's soul. People were born with one mouth and two ears thereby being really easy to vulnerable when hearing bad things. Before saying anything, people should think carefully and find another suitable time to express their own opinion. It cannot be imagined how many patients will become negative and devastated if they directly hear about their serious illness from doctors. Another impressive example is the way Napoleon Hill taught his deaf child, thanks to his white lie, his child could overcome any obstacles and become a successful man, who everyone extremely admired. In conclusion, telling the truth can have both advantages and disadvantages depending on specific circumstances. The aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for me to contend that thinking carefully before saying anything is of great importance.

Studying abroad is very popular nowadays. Many students decide to go abroad to high school or university. It's a fantastic way to make your CV better. However, it doesn't have only advantages, obviously. Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, I'm a person who would like to go to university abroad, too. First of all, as I say, studying abroad is a very good way to make your CV better. Nowadays, many companies prefer to take a person from a foreign university rather than a local one. To my mind, that person can seem to be bolder and more self-assured, which are meaningful attributes for directors. Equally important is that studying abroad is a valuable life lesson. A student goes abroad on his own, so he or she has to take control of his or her life. There will be no one, of course, who will do things except for him or her. It doesn't mean that he or she will be alone, obviously. Studying abroad is a superb way to make new friend, of course. But friends will not make dinner, clean the room or do laundry. Actually, we have here another paramount advantage which is making new friends and exploring the world. As we know, people who have travelled the world are more open-minded than those who stayed in one place all their life. But on the other hand, studying abroad can be stressful. A student goes to a place where he doesn't know anybody. It is a new place, a new world for him. Another disadvantage may be a language problem. Sometimes students can have a big problem with understanding something, and of course, it makes them stressed, as I mentioned earlier. In summary, I honestly believe that there are more advantages than disadvantages. Due to this, to my mind, students should study abroad, if they have a chance.

Every school class has at least two students who love to practise sports activities. On the other hand, there are also some students who are very lazy and hate sports. Many schools offer a gym or classes but not all of them are compulsory. The hard part of every school or university is now to find the ultimate balance between forcing their students to be active and not to overdo it. Before I write more about the amount of sports activities, I would like to catch up with the main importance of sports. Many clinical studies have proven that any kind of physical movement can boost your immune system, improve your cardiovascular system and prevent depression. Those three examples are just a brief insight into the benefits of sports. Of course, no school or university has the ability to offer thousands of different sports options. They may give you a choice of select classes. For example a running group, football team, cheerleading classes or even a small gym with free weights. However, it does not matter what kind of sports you prefer, it just matters that you focus on your well-being and health. Now, we can talk more about the amount of exercise per week. First of all, there is no golden rule for this. It really depends on what kind of sports you practise and what goals each person has. To come back to the main question of forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week, it would be a miracle to follow this system but it's not realistic. Students should have at least one to two classes in their weekly school calender where they need to do some kind of sports activities.

I'm used to using a computer about two times a day, I need to do it for my English practise and because I have to write a big variety of documents. These are not the only reasons I use a computer, its usefulness is also related to the way I keep in touch with my friends. The most enjoyable thing I do is to play chess and follow online English lessons, apart from when I do not have a good internet connection.

Well, I think it's better to have the same teacher for several years. It's better for the educational process. You know, the teacher can create something suitable for a student, an individual educational plan for him. I think the relationship between student and teacher must be close, from an educational point of view. If that relationship doesn't work, if it's uncomfortable for the student or the teacher, just in that case, there has to be a change. Education has an emotional side that is important. Some experts that I have read said: "emotion goes before reason," which means, emotion influences rational thinking more than we suspect. All the things that we think, we feel them first. If we have a comfortable space to learn we'll learn how to think better. But despite that, people grow and need a different educational strategy, and that has to come with a different teacher. A different teacher who will guide the student as he gets older.

I agree with the opinion that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Because we have a lot less chance to touch and think about animals if zoos are prohibited. We also might not be concerned about various animal problems. Of course, some people worry about animals which are tamed in a zoo. But unfortunately nobody knows if animals really feel sad or have bad feelings. This is just the imagination of humans. Then what we should do for animals is to think about animals and to take actions like conservation. I think that there are mainly two tasks for zoo managers. First, they shouldn't run the zoo only for their profit. They should take part in some actions for animals. They should never forget that they run their business with living creatures and they should partly work for animals. Second, they must tell visitors the true stories about each animal. There might be a future zoologist. I hope that managers help children be more interested in animals. Anyway I want managers to run their zoos with social responsibility. If they keep this condition, the above two things will come true.

I think that foreign languages are very important these days. If you manage to learn one or two foreign languages your changes to be hired are increased by more than 50%. If you want to learn a foreign language I think the best way you could do that is by following an English course. To learn the language more easily you could watch movies and try to find a native person that could help you learn more easily. Doing exercises at home will help you a lot. I recommend you also use Duolingo to learn a foreign language. It's really helpful because you can write, learn, and speak using Duolingo. One of the most important aspects if you want to learn a new language I think is your determination. If you have the ambition to learn it you will succeed.

I think students benefit more from having new teachers each year rather than having the same teacher for several years. Each teacher has their speciality and character. If students have the same teacher for several years, they can't get new knowledge which the teacher doesn't know, they can't notice other points of view which the teacher doesn't have , and they can't feel comfortable if the teacher's character is not suitable for them. If students have new teachers each year, they can get new experiences from the new teacher each year. These new experiences change their opinion about something, the purpose of their life, and their future dreams. Even if the new teacher isn't suitable for the students, they just bear it for only one year and they can meet a new teacher next year. It may take several days or weeks to become used to a new teacher every year, but it should give students a great opportunity to know how to interact with other people.

I'm not only a generous and introvert person, but also a social person, so I really want to be a volunteer, especially when I am sitting on a school chair. I felt really happy when I saw that requirement. In my opinion, students like me will have a lot of benefits when they take part in some social work and become volunteers. Firstly, they will feel happy when they help people or protect the environment. From that, they will be more and more motivated to do many good works and have good behavior. Secondly, they will have lots of chances to practise many skills necessary for their future such as community skills, problem-solving skills and so on. Thirdly, they will recognise their advantages and also their disadvantages through real work. From that, they can promote their advantages and fix their disadvantages. Fourthly, if they become a volunteer, they can contact many people so they can improve their ability in teamwork. Fifthly, through what they do when they were a volunteer, they will have a lot of good memories and many useful experiences. Finally, after graduating, they will have many good relationships and more friends. I hope students could be a volunteer before they graduate.

When I was a child, I loved zoos. Animals are so amazing. We could learn about life, seeing them. And we could also learn about respecting them. But today I have another opinion, because, in some zoos, animals can't be happy. They have the right to live in their own environment, just as we have. And in some zoos it's not possible because they don't offer good living conditions. But at the same time, visiting them in their habitat, will be impossible for many of us. We will be an intruder in their home. So the zoos will continue to be an option. But they have to be bigger, to provide a home like their environment. It won't be cheap!! But if we think it will be the fair option, I can't see another one. But this structure has other problem. Maintaining these zoos is very expensive, so who will be able to pay for seeing the animals? Will it be available for poor children? Well, they have the internet but it it will not be the same, of course.

My opinion is that it is good to study abroad for a time during high school or university. There are 2 advantages. First, you can learn something abroad which people living in Japan cannot experience. You have some different experiences so that you have your own strong points and you can be successful in the future. Those who can think up original ideas are always needed for every field. Second, you can learn another language. It is difficult to learn a language effortlessly as we get older. No matter what language you may study, it will be your strong point if you can master it. And if you can speak some language, you can communicate with many people. You can improve your personality with this experience. Apart from that, there are also 2 disadvantages. First, no one can know whether you can fit in with the environment where you will go. The risks associated with leaving your hometown are bigger than you expect. It is not a big problem for you to check some information in advance, like diseases or a culture. But you cannot check what the locals are like and how the weather and the humidity influence you. These are serious problems. Next, if you think you will be successful as a member of the elite in Japan, I don't recommend you to study abroad. It may be not good for your career. Because the Japanese culture is really unique. And many Japanese people become conservative as they get older. You don't need to take an additional risk. You'd better enter a high school and a university in Japan. Anyway, I approve of the opinion that students should study abroad in their young days. The experience you get there is your treasure.

To be honest, I think that video games are dangerous. They reward you with too much dopamine for tasks that are too easy. Everything else is very hard in comparison to games. Children do not want to do something useful because the dopamine rush produced by video games is so high. Everything else seems too boring and it decreases their productivity and development. One of the biggest problems is that video games can result in increasingly violent behavior. Soldiers are learning about their huge responsibility with their weapons. It is strictly regulated when they can use violence and they know all the consequences. But in video games children are receiving good points for killing a virtual enemy with no punishment for killing innocent people. They are used to killing. They are being nurtured to kill without consequences. Another thing is that video games do not reflect reality. You can drive a virtual car at a speed of 200 mph and there is no danger while doing it. So why should you drive responsibly in real life if you do not know any better?

I have never liked zoos, the animal abuse is sad to see. New technology will change things. People can learn about animals differently nowadays, for example, in Japan they have created a 7D Holographic Projection Display Zoo where you can get close to animals safely, both for the animal and for the visitors. This technology uses different dimensions to capture an object (7 D). Reality has a 3-dimensional space, we know that, but the reason why we are talking about so many dimensions here is because the hologram is captured from a large number of positions and each position is described in a 3-dimensional space. Each position captures a variety of viewing directions in 2-dimensional space. Two additional parameters are captured for each direction: image intensity and time. In other words, a 7D technology is like having a bunch of photographers surrounding an object. This technology is fascinating and can help us to get into the wild and learn about it without animal abuse. In the past, zoos were important to us, opened our minds and helped us to see nature in a fantastic way, but time has changed and we can do things differently.

I have heard music accounts for 80% of life. In my opinion, we should learn music or learn how to play a musical instrument. There are a lot of musical instruments so if you don't like drums, you can be interested in the piano or guitar and so on. I think there are many benefits if we know how to play an instrument. Firstly, music will make you feel happier and love life more. You will be more motivated to do more and more good works. Your soul will be relaxed and comfortable and have more energy than before. Secondly, music also helps you love yourselves more. You will respect yourselves and behave well with them. If sometimes you feel stressed, you should close your eyes and listen to some soft music. You will feel better than before. Thirdly, learning a musical instrument is not only good for morable, but also improves your IQ. Fourthly, your reflexes will be more sensitive and you can solve a situation or problem quickly. Finally, learning a musical instrument is a way to discover your talent. From that, you won't miss your chance to grow yourself. Therefore, we should learn them.

My reasons for learning English I started learning English when I was 5 years old, but it wasn´t until I was 11, when I realised how much this language means to me. Firstly, talking about labour stuff, speaking English is such a useful way of communication that it will bring you a lot more prestige when applying for a job. That means that nowadays, speaking English is a big advantage that will help you to get better jobs. Secondly, English is a really important thing in my life because it has helped me to figure out what I want to do in my life. (something I was struggling to discover). Thanks to that, I have learned a lot about the awesome American and English culture and their delightful people. To sum up, I really think that English is a very important language to learn nowadays, not only because it will bring you a great deal of opportunities, but also because it will help you to grow as a person and will open your eyes to the real world.

Television can educate us, but only on the surface. You do not know the sources of the information from television. You have to watch with caution and check the information and make comparisons with other sources like books. The problem is that television needs to get your attention. So it has to be exciting or funny. And real events sometimes seem boring, so the directors make them a little more spicy. For example, they combine two different events into one or they may double the number of foes in a historic battle. Education by television deeply depends on the quality of screenwriters and advisors. Usually the most capable scientists do not work for television. They write books and teach at universities or work in business. So I think that television can educate us, but it can't be a primary source of knowledge.

As we know, health is wealth and it is a well-known fact and universally accepted. If you are healthy, then you can enjoy your life as you wish. for a healthy life you have to allow sufficient time for exercise. Meanwhile, there are many more things which are as important as exercise in the different age groups of a human being's life, which I wish to explore in this essay. As we know, there are the three basic stages of life: childhood, adulthood, and old age and every stage has its own importance and liabilities. When one is a child , one has to learn things for which one has parents and teachers. No doubt, at an early age in life, like during childhood and the teenage years, one does not have family and social obligations and one can arrange a lot of time for physical activities like exercise and playing outdoor games, while a lot of time is needed for study, if one wants to beat any competition. In addition, most teenagers are healthy. Meanwhile, when you grow up and get married, you have a lot of obligations like social life, caring for your parents with their own personal family and also earning money and enhancing your skills and qualities to get promotion in your job or business.

I am going to describe my experience with Write and Improve. To begin with, I totally like it for four reasons. Firstly, its variety of topics. Since I can find many kinds of topics, I improve my writing skills more and more. Secondly, its marking speed. As soon as I push the check button, it marks and corrects my writings. It does save a lot of time. Thirdly, its score history. I can see my past grades. It allows me to know how I improve my writing skills and stay motivated. Lastly, its design. It is very tidy and helpful to navigate the service. However, I have one point I dislike. It is the degree to which it corrects things. It is very hard to understand where or how I can correct my writings to make them better ones. It adds shades to the sentences, but this is not helpful. I want it to add more detailed notes to my writings. Finally, I really rely on this service. I recommend you to start using it.

Have you ever thought that the means of travelling would change in the future? There is nothing in the world you can think that people are not able to do. Let us have a look at the progress we have made until now. For a start, smartphones are developing each days. If you compare to what we had twenty years ago, you will see that non-touchscreen phones don't exist anymore. Mobiles phones possess a lot of applications that can replace most of the devices that we use everyday, such as a calculator or a chronometer. I must also mention that cars have developed as well, particularly hybrid cars, which didn't exist two decades ago. Apart from that, some buses can work without a driver, it can detect people who want to take the bus via an application. Personally, I believe that in twenty years to come, there will be a huge change in the means of travelling. Maybe a journey through time will be possible. Who knows?

You can appreciate those feelings only in summer when the weather is hot. For a start, we can buy ice cream everywhere, especially by the shore, and with every flavour, such as chocolate, vanilla, or mocha. I must also mention that you don't have to wear a coat or tights, nor gloves or a bonnet. Apart from that, it is not really possible to catch a cold or have flu like in wintertime. Personally, I believe that summer is like a sort of holiday for everybody and it is not that bad even if sometimes we can have hay fever. But for me, summer is the best season because the daylight last longer than in wintertime.

There are four main sources for all our human life: exercise, diet, oxygen, and water. Our health needs a workout, therefore exercise is essential. However, if you are doing exercise without dieting it is not effective. Firstly, exercise is not only to improve our health but also to improve our body shape. Recently, all around the world, the obesity rate has become higher and higher because people don't have enough time to make a meal, they only rely on junk food which is loads of fat and salt. For example, instant noodles are pretty popular globally, most people take that instead of meals. Secondly, the gym is more and more expensive, which is why people also need money. Apparently, working hours are additional and competitive to get a better job or earn loads of money. Last but not least, diet is vice - versa with exercise which is can keep to fit. For example, some people do not do exercise, but they eat a balanced diet they have to stay more than one hundred years. do not underestimate a diet. In conclusion, exercise is essential for our health, exercise is essential for our health but some of this follow things need to keep up.

Hello, Today, I want to write to you about my favorite film. It is not easy to point out one, the favourite. So I have decided that I will write about the first film I remember when I think about my favorite film. It is called Vanishing Point. According to my opinion the main character of the film is a car. A Dodge Challenger. It sounds strange, doesn't it? But it is quite a deep film. The plot is simple. The driver, whose name is Kowalski, has to deliver the car to some distant place and the time is running. But there is a deeper meaning. It is about freedom and about the human soul. Kowalski reaches his breaking point and sets himself free of all conventions and just drives. He meets some interesting people on his journey, too. All together it is really a masterpiece. I guess you can try it yourself. Let me know if you liked it. I am looking forward to your answer. Best wishes, Kuba

The future of travel Nowadays, everybody uses a way of travelling. Whether it is by private car or taking public transport people need to go to their job because the majority of them don't work near their homes. However, I think that in the future travel will be different. Technology is developed every day in order to help humans with their lives, so why wouldn't creating new ways of travelling be possible? I think that travel will change dramatically in the future. Trams might be suspended above the streets and descend where people need to get off. Car engines will work on more ecological fuel, like compost or solar energy instead of gas. There will also be more express trains which will travel all the way around a continent offering, in this way, the opportunity to see the world to more ordinary people. Whatever the future might bring, one thing that I think will not be changed for a good amount of time is the way in which airplanes work and look. These are already quite developed and I don't see what changes might be applied to them. The truth is that nobody can know for sure what inventions will be brought to life in the future. But the thing I am sure of is that these will surprise us.

What I noticed in the first few days is the team's professionalism, they have plenty of subjects to cover every level, even if you are beginner or advanced. One of the thing that I like most on this website is the feedback which they give you after every activity. In my opinion, this feedback helps the students a lot because this is the only way you can know if you are right or wrong. On the internet I have found many websites where you can practise your writing, but not many of them give you the feedback.

In my opinion, studying abroad is the best way to improve your knowledge. As for improving language or any other knowledge, living abroad offers the opportunity to exchange some experiences, so we can learn more. The problem is that living abroad is not always good for everyone. You miss your family and friends. You have to adapt to new cultures and sometimes it's against your beliefs. And you need some money of course, especially if you are from a country where your currency has less value than that of the country you are moving to. But when you are far from your family and friends you can establish new relationships. You can reflect about how your life is going. What is better for you; the way people in your country are living or the way of life in a different country? Of course, studying abroad, you are going to expand your social circle because you will meet people from different countries. we will have more advantages studying abroad.

What is the most important thing our life? We have a lot of different answers for this question. Some say money, lots of money, other people say a happy family. For me, the important and precious thing in our life is health. I guess there are a lot of people who think like me but most of them don't care about their health much, especially the young people like university students and school children. I'm also a school student, so I understand a part of what young people think and the things they care a lot about. Before, I was a lazy person about taking care of myself, especially exercise and health. I just concentrated on studying, my goals and the way I could achieve these. I used to hate doing exercise in the morning very much because I thought it wasted my precious time. Even my mother always reminded me do exercise or play some sports. But I often ignored her. Then a little problem about health came to me. Suddenly, I realized my faults at that time and I started caring about my health more than before. There are a lot of reasons for us to be concerned about our health, especially doing more exercise at least 3 times a week. Firstly, health is the most important thing in our life. Our parents gave birth to us very strong, having good health, so we must have the responsibility to protect our health through doing exercise, playing sports, changing our bad habits and also our lifestyle. Secondly, a bad lifestyle affects our yield of work and study. We always feel tired, exhausted and don't have energy to continue the work. Finally, we are usually unconscious, so we will have negative thinking and make decisions that are not good. So young people should play sports at least 3 times a week. We will feel better and have more energy after each training session. We also have a lot of friends. It will improve relationships. There are a lot of benefits when we play sports. Therefore, we should play them more often.

In my honest opinion, I think that doing volunteer work is a good activity to do, but nobody likes doing volunteer work because this activity does not give an award or money. People that do this activity are makes this activity are solidarity, and they are always thinking about the next person that needs their help. Doing volunteer work is not mandatory, only those who want it, do it. Unfortunately, few people are trying do volunteer work, it isn't enough, we need more people help the old people, children with a deficiency or other problems. That's the best idea ever, and everyone needs to be a little bit solidarity with the others, because for example, in the future, probably we will need the help of the younger people, money, clothes etc. Nowadays there are non-governmental organizations that help a lot of places in the world with help and other people donate, some people do not have so much money but, if you help a little bit, I'm sure that this little will make all the difference in the world.

Firstly, their violent situation. Children cannot get to recognize the difference between real and virtual. Secondly, their time. Children may spend lots of time on playing games. As a result they don't make time to study, which is the duty of children. Well, don't we have a compromise? Yes, we have. It is intellectual games. I think this is the only positive point the video games have. By playing intellectual games, for example, study games or puzzle games, children can activate their brain. It is very useful to improve their structural thinking. In conclusion, I almost agree with the opinion that video games can have a negative impact on children, but I also have a compromise in which intellectual games can be valuable for children.

My favourite indoor activity is tennis. I usually take a racket and I play with three colleagues at the court wall. We don't have the same level, so we often play the best one with the worst one. We play for an hour and we are very tired when we finish each match. We enjoy playing this sport a lot but we haven´t been to play recently. We should go to work and we work at different hours, so it is very difficult to meet to play.

But when I go home I always switch on my computer and I usually use it for studying English. I hardly ever use my computer for playing computer games. I'd prefer to play with a game console. My computer is my best friend. I like it a lot.

Hello everybody, I'm Nael! Today I will talk to you about a website for learners of English. Many people say it is so hard to find a great website or a great tool to learn English but today I will present to you the best website to improve your abilities and skills in English when you are a beginner or confirmed. Its name is Write and Improve. This website was created by Cambridge University in 2016, it is free and it is very easy to access. First of all, in this website you can write about many subjects like global warming or your favorite hobbies according to each level and when you have finished a robot checks all your answers and it shows you all your right and wrong answers. Moreover, after that you can see your evolution and be better than yesterday, you can practise yourself every time and also be more confident when you write in English. Personally, I have used "Write and Improve" for two months and I can see a very big progression between when I started and now, I have also increased my vocabulary so now I'm able to write an email, by the way. I recommend "Write and and Improve" to you for many reasons but if I have to choose only one to come here, it will be because it's pretty easy to learn in "Write and Improve " and do not forget, studying is the best thing you have to do.

Firstly, Write and Improve provides me the opportunity to write in English. If you carry on every day, it is meant to improve your English writing skills. Learning English is sometimes quite solitary, so it could be helpful to receive the correct sentences. Secondly, Write and Improve corrects my wrong words and weird sentences. We, Japanese, are careless about articles so much because this idea never exists in Japanese. Meanwhile, there are many intricated words which have a similar meaning, thus we also struggle to find the appropriate words for each sentence. I think native speakers feel that Japanese English is weird. We sometimes really don't know which word is correct in each sentence. However, Write and Improve teaches me the correct word in my sentences. Finally, I got to look up these intricated words in a dictionary. Write and Improve encourages me to learn English profoundly. Therefore, I strongly recommend my classmates to try Write and Improve and keep practising English.

Since I always have plenty of projects to carry out, I do not have enough free time, therefore as soon as I find some spare time, I appreciate it and try to utilize it effectively. I really enjoy reading ancient novels. Reading such books takes me away from the present time and provides me with a new environment to spend time in, so I am able to find moments that I am living in another time, far away from the chaos of my life. This is a relaxing activity and a stress reliever for me. I try to read these types of books every day and make it a habit and the last time I tried it was a few minutes ago.

During quarantine, I found myself having a lot of free time on my hands. My English teacher advised me to practise my English with the help of " Write and Improve." I really like that everything is automated. Therefore, you do not feel the pressure of someone judging you, which gives me more freedom to write and practise. I also like it that the feedback is provided very quickly. This encourages me to write more and it stays enjoyable. The only thing that can maybe improve the whole project could be better feedback in grammar. I sometimes do not know why I am getting a low level score or why a sentence is wrong, even if the spelling is on point. Because I am dyslectic, it is very difficult for me to see my own mistakes in a sentence structure. I would recommend "Write and Improve" to everyone who wants to write more in English. I think the best way to learn English is to stay active with it.

I like doing exercises so much. When I was young I went with three friends to a court wall near our house. I wore a T-shirt, my shorts and my trainers. I took a racket and a ball. We played from eight to nine in the evening twice a week. When we finished we were very tired, but it didn't matter because we enjoyed it a lot. Now I do exercise indoors every day. I use an app from my smartphone. I like to be healthy.

First, I'll tell you the advantages of studying abroad, after that, the disadvantages. I have come up with three advantages. Firstly, you can study what you are interested in more deeply than in your country. It leads to you broadening your knowledge. Secondly, you can learn the language spoken there as well as English, which is an international language. It leads you to be a global person. Thirdly, you can feel the culture there, which you won't touch unless you are living there. It makes you understand the diversity of values. I think all of these are important or essential to be an educated person. It's not in vain for you to experience this life. Well, I have one concern, one disadvantage. It is that you may have to delay your graduation. It depends on the curriculum of your university. If you want to graduate with your friends, you need to take care of the system.

Volunteer work is an absolutely wonderful way to help others and grow within your experiences. People get the opportunity to help injured and sick children who are in hospitals or spend some time with animals in animal shelters. There are thousands of places where volunteer workers are hardly needed. I personally support the requirement from the high schools. The students should be forced to learn that there are so many people who need our help. I am not just talking about hospitalized or homeless people. I am also focusing on the staff working there every day. They will be, for sure, more than happy to get a helping hand. A most important point is to let the students choose their preferred working place. The motivation to complete a certain amount of volunteer work will be there as long as the student likes and enjoys the work he is doing. Furthermore, the students will be impressed how much joy it will bring into their lives when they could lighten up the day of another person. No amount of money could pay this amazing and heartwarming feeling off. Have you ever looked into the big, shiny and happy eyes of a thankful kid? Yes, it is amazing! Besides the joyful opportunity of helping others, the students will also learn how hard work looks like. It is the perfect preparation for the life after high school. However, the volunteer work will teach every student a lifelong lesson. They may even find inspiration for their future work places. I am very sure that some students will love the feeling of helping others and they could spend some month abroad and work perhaps in South America or Africa.

Now I have a lot of free time but I don't have enough free time when I go to work. I work one month in the morning and the other one in the evening. When I work in the morning I usually have a nap. After that I study English for about an hour. Then I go out with my family and we meet our friends. On Wednesdays and Fridays my wife and I go to our children's training. I like reading books in my free time and I also like watching series.

As every grown person in the 21st century ought to know, not every human looks, feels and desires the same from one other. Due to these facts, in order to respect each individual's personality, a considerable amount of freedom should be given to each person. Among the concept of freedom, free choice is an essential issue. On the one hand, although I might sound quite idealistic. I have to say that I strongly respect and understand the importance of rules, without them our society would be an anarchy and daily life would be like putting an elephant into a car. However, with regards to volunteer work I have a completely solid point of view and I will wholeheartedly defend it. The reason why I am so concerned about this topic is that I absolutely believe that there are certain things that appear from the deepest part of our soul, and forcing those feelings and emotions result in an awful ending. Volunteer work is not for everyone, those courageous people who dare to volunteer have some kind of magical attitude inside themselves. Therefore, including this activity as compulsory at school couldn't be more useless. Nevertheless, there are endless activities to do in order to teach solidarity and empathy, such as playing a team sport or planting trees. In conclusion, considering all things carefully mentioned above, as far as I am concerned, only those who hugely desire to volunteer should do so. It does not mean they are better people, they just have something special to give to those people who absolutely need their help.

Dear Billal, I went to Tokyo with some students from my class last week. As my wallet was worn out, I went to a department store to buy a new one. There were so many items that I wanted to buy.

It is kind of an interesting activity that gives me a chance to clear my mind and see the nature which refreshes my body and gives me energy. The last time I was hiking in mountain in Switzerland.

A NEW SCHOOL YEAR Introduction The purpose of this report is to think about and plan my new school year regarding things that I already achieved, subjects that I can improve, and to establish new goals to achieve during the year. My convenient areas of study Since I was really small, I've been good at mathematics, English, and geography. I have always been keen on those subjects so my plan for this year is to maintain that level, although it will be a little bit more complicated than last year. Improving subjects On the other hand, I'm used to struggling in areas like Spanish language, physics, or arts. So during this course I'll try to give more attention to those things in order to get better marks so the next year won't be that difficult. Motivation and effort Finally, encouragement and endeavour, these are going to be the keys for me this year . Working really hard during school time and relaxing on holidays are my plans so that I can achieve all my aims. Moreover, being organised and constant are indispensable too.

I think that the schools of the future will be a lot more modern, because I think that we will see robots that will be teaching class instead of humans. There will be screens resembling notebooks. A lunchbox won't be necessary, the parents will send droids to their children with their lunch, and pick it up. I think the homework will be all sent and done on a screen or on a computer. Maybe at recess time you will be able to use your cellphone to play video games all the time. And when you finish school, a mega-fast car will take you back to your house in no time while you do homework or play with your cellphone. The mega-fast car will be very comfy inside and have a table to work at inside! I think that's how schools will be in the future.

Dear Matt, How are you? I was really glad when I received your letter. The new school year is coming. I feel happy and plentiful but I also feel a little anxiety and nervous about my English. My listening, speaking and a little grammar isn't really good. I studied a lot last summer but it didn't improve much. So I am going to have a detailed plan to improve it this new school year. Firstly, I will listen to English 1,5-2 hours a day. Secondly, I will practise English with my friends or I will also use my free time to talk with myself in the mirror. Thirdly, I will do a lot of grammar in the book. Finally, I will take part in several online free websites. What about your plan? I'm looking forward to your letter. My friend, B. B

Both have benefits and drawbacks. When students have the same teacher for several years, the teacher is meant to know them very well individually. Therefore, whenever they need help, the teacher would give them a hand appropriately. However, a teacher who knows them very well, may be like their friend and would not be able to make a fair decision. On the other hand, when students have new teachers each year, they could remain nervous until they get to know the new teacher. However, once they have got round to having a good relationship with the new teacher, they have got round to take up a good relationship with the new teacher, they enjoy everyday life to keep or improve the relationship with the new teacher. Personally speaking, I think a new teacher would be better for education because all students get to learn how to develop a good relationship with the new person. I strongly think that it is an inevitable experience in social life.

I don't think so. I suppose we can learn by watching TV. It has shown many educational shows on YouTube so far. A lot of children are watching it and learning the ropes. It is a good way to drawn their attention to this industry. I like to watch drama & anime that involve science or philosophy. It makes my interest in biology grow more. So I learned about genes, microbiomes and pathology, which is hard. I'm feeling good about children using television to study. It's more interesting and enjoyable. We're feeling the sluggish of just reading a book that is full of texts. It has inadequate education and a deficiency of joy. And they readily give up studying as joy is scarce. Many authors are trying to come up with attractive methods for children to study. But it's a difficult things. Anime or manga will easy makes there happy quickly. For instance, NHK has broadcast education channels for a long time. It's helped me.

I want to work on three things in this school year. They are programming, bookkeeping, and English. Firstly, I would like to master programming because it is necessary for me to graduate from university. Without it, I cannot do my graduation studies any more. I am a totally beginner now, so I try hard to build a foundation. Secondly, I would like to master bookkeeping because it is necessary for work as of next year. As I'm going to enter a financially related company, I am forced to acquire the second grade of it. Thirdly, I would like to master English because it is necessary to live in this coming society. Furthermore, my future company is a multinational. If I use English fluently, I could get a more responsible job. Well, how will I achieve these goals? I've already begun online speaking lessons every day and studying them. However, I imagine that it is very tough to study them in parallel.

Recently, the world has dramatically changed. Due to globalization people have started to be interested in other cultures. I think that learning to speak a foreign language is more important nowadays than in the past. First of all, technological development has made travelling so much easier. If we want to communicate with other people while being abroad we have to be able to speak in a language which is commonly used, such as English or Spanish. What is more, studies have shown that learning languages helps our brain to work more efficiently. If we want to be able to speak fluently we have to be constantly exposed to the language and practise our memory. On the other hand, some people claim that the knowledge of a foreign language is not useful nowadays because of the technological devices which we have. The usage of online dictionaries fully enables us to communicate with other people in any language we want. To sum up, I think that learning to speak a foreign language nowadays is more important because it makes communicating with people so much easier and helps our brain to stay efficient longer. We should not be dependent on online devices because they can stop working in the least expected moment.

Nowadays, more people worry about their health than ten years ago. They visit doctors regularly and go on special diets. But they forget that without money they are not able to make their dreams come true. In my opinion, being healthy is more important than being rich. Firstly, if you are healthy you can go to work and earn money. If you are a good worker, you can be promoted fast. What's more, when you go to work you are staying in touch with your colleagues and friends. It helps to develop and balance your emotional health. Secondly, health is important when you have a family. Without health you are not able to bring up your children properly. If your health is not good enough you waste your free time on visiting doctors instead of playing with your children. Finally, you can lose the opportunity to build a special relationship with them. On the other hand, money helps to make your dream come true. Furthermore, with it your life is easier and more comfortable. You don't have to worry about the future. To sum up, health is the most valuable thing in our life. Without this our life could not be happy and full.

I think that students benefit more from having new teachers each year. When I was a child, I had the same teacher for two years; her name was Miss Matilde. It was in first and second grade. The teacher was a wonderful person. She was patient with us. Also, she was a very experienced teacher. In fact, she taught us to read and write. After that, we felt bad when we passed to third grade with a new teacher; her name was Miss Martha. Miss Martha was a little more serious than Miss Matilde, or I sometimes think that she was more serious because we were older than two years before and she treated us as third grade children. It was ugly of us. I think that all of us expected that Miss Matilde would be the teacher again. We missed Miss Matilde. We said to the Principal that we wanted Miss Matilde again, so she told us that the teacher should be changed every year in order for students to get to know new people and develop new skills. Now I agree with the Principal.

There is no doubt that there are a lot of great options these days to study different specialities at many universities. Some people say studying abroad has many advantages. Firstly, students can get to know a new country and culture and deal with other people. Secondly, they can improve themselves in science and literature. Lastly, they can have a lot of friends from these countries and connect with them. On the other hand, others believe there are disadvantages. After studying, some students decide to live in these countries and never come back home again. Also, when people live in one of the developed countries with all of its benefits it will be hard to come back to their developing countries. In my opinion, I believe that studying abroad has pros and cons, but it is really important to improve our developing countries by sending some student to study abroad.

I think that a lot of people would prefer to live a very adventurous and intense life. They think that studying, reading and such things are boring. Those things belong in a boring life. They will define a life that is calm, but long, as boring. Then there are the kind of people who would like to live a long and calm life. They think that they'll get all out of life if they live a calm and long life. In fact, I don't think that I want to choose either way of life. I want to see things in life. I want to hear, feel and experience things in life. I want to live life to the fullest. But that doesn't mean I don't want to grow old. I would very much like both of these to a certain degree. I want to live life to 'the fullest', but I want to grow old as well. I want to love. I want to read. I want to grow old with my partner. I guess you could see that as living a calm and long life. I don't think you have to make a choice between the two. I think that you could have a very adventurous youth, and when the time is there, you start to live calmly again. You'll settle down, have children, and grow old.

Throughout the years, we have been hearing that telling a lie is not acceptable behaviour, but why? I personally think that telling lies and being truthful is an essential quality maybe because lying gets you in trouble and makes you seen as not honest which ends up making you unwelcome in society, especially if you wanted to fit in. However, I believe that there are certain situations when lying is considered to be a good thing, nobody can not argue the fact that lying can be a necessity sometimes but being honest is also a necessity. I do not believe in white lies, they all are lies after all but it is totally acceptable if needed for making a small compliment, not trying to embarrass people and such things. I try to be honest as much as I can and I try to avoid lying, nonetheless I view lying as taboo in issues that require being completely honest because I find it much easier to accept myself, that is, if I lied in situations I should never lie in, my conscience would punish me so I could not live with myself any more. An example of when telling a lie is acceptable and OK for me is when a friend asks me how the food is and I find it too salty, it is one of these funny and small situations that won't do any harm or have any effect in the future.

I think there are two things that are more important for our health than exercise. They are sleep and diet. Unless we have a standard healthy body, we cannot do appropriate exercise to improve our health. In order to get this body, enough sleep and a balanced diet are essential. Firstly, without enough sleep, we suffer from disorders such as anemia. In addition to that, we will have rough skins. They make us sad to live a healthy life. Secondly, without a balanced diet, we suffer from less energy, which causes a lack of motivation. In addition to that, we will get fat. This makes us disappointed to do anything. On the other hand, with these two conditions, we are ready to get exercise. Exercise is the most important activity to live a healthy life in this condition. It is better to do only a little exercise than do nothing. As for me, I began to train my muscles to get a beautiful body. It is very interesting because I know how I changed my body. I'll keep motivating myself to achieve my goal.

I think the way of travelling will be different, however, the aim of travel might still be the same in the future. Firstly, the way of travelling should be different. It is going to be extreme, which is going to the further away or staying at home. Thanks to the advances in research, we will travel the universe, for example, to the moon or to Mars. Space travel will be popular in the near future. On the other hand, thanks to technological development, we will travel virtually, for example, via our own PC. In spite of sitting at a table, we can experience the scenery of where we want to visit. Secondly, the aim of travel would be the same. Travel is one of the ways to escape from daily life and enter an unusual life in order to take a rest. This is the human instinct. I hope it won't be changed. In conclusion, this is just my idea of future travel. I am looking forward to seeing the answer in the future.

It is clear that humans have their own behaviour and thinking. Some people think telling the truth is the main behaviour in your life but lying is the best way to cover your positive or negative things. From my viewpoint, telling lies is the most powerful way to cover your things. To begin with, every day people are always telling the truth. It will not be because you are optimistic as the manager or CEO, someone may ask you about your future plans or how to control your company. Will you talk to him directly about how to work? If he is so naive or out of his mind, he will talk about it. And also, some information I overheard from someone, he said that "using NOT everywhere, you will not lose your items and money will be rolling in." Likewise, I regard that, instead of saying something positive rather than negative. On the other hand, if you are always lying to everybody, people will be unfriendly or keep away from you and consequently, they will say that " he is a liar, do not make him a friend, if you make friends with him, you might not get real information." That's why every day you could not only tell truths and tell lies, everything fair and square is the most tremendous to behave in the world. Nevertheless, you have to use your words in the circumstances of the situation. In conclusion, you cannot change another person's mindset and thinking but you need to balance how the situation is and behave negatively or positively. Undoubtedly, lying is irritable to other people but good for you.

In terms of studying abroad, there are many reasons that encourage students to seek the opportunity of studying in another country. It boils down to the fact that some specializations are not available in their own country, and the students prefer a strong university to obtain their certificate from. Also, they want to get a chance to work and study in another country to improve their skills and experiences, as well as have relationships with other students or colleagues to exchange their knowledge and create opportunities to work together, which maybe helps them to depend on themselves. In addition, with their mission to get what they aim to it. The bad side of studying abroad is that some learners do not have goals for their choice of studying at a university abroad.

People use mobile phones everywhere, at home, in a park or street, on public transport and in cafes and restaurants. They use it to make calls, to use social media, or just to listen to music. This practice has grown from year to year. For instance, in public transport we see almost no one using their mobile phones. This habit often disturbs the convenient use of public facilities, including public transport. To reduce or avoid this practice, banning the use of mobile phones should be implemented. Among all activities using mobile phones, the use of mobile phones to make calls, including video calls, should be strictly prohibited. This policy will prohibit people from overusing their mobile phones. Other activities, like listening to music, including watching videos, reading books or articles and other activities which do not make any noise should be allowed. This rule should be clearly written in every pubic facility, including public transport. The implementation of the rule could be different between public facilities. For instance, we prohibit making calls in public transport and restaurants, but we allow them in the train station building. There should be an exception in which all people are allowed to make emergency calls, wherever they are. Furthermore, the exact rules should be discussed among different kinds of people: workers, civil servants, and students. By implementing the banning of mobile phones usage, the convenience of using public facilities like public transport and restaurants should be improved.

I want to tell you more about a new tool I discovered lately. As I am myself a learner of English, I am always looking for new support that can be instructive. Being curious is in my opinion the first step to achieve something, and looking for a solution by yourself is an excellent way to go. So, let me tell you more about my finding: Write and Improve.

For many people, honesty is one of the most important virtues. It is generally known that people dislike liars. But could it be true that in some situations, it is better to lie than to always speak the truth? In my opinion, lying isn't always bad. In fact, sometimes telling a lie is the only right thing to do, and I would like to explain why. To begin with, sometimes it is more convenient for yourself and others to lie than to tell the truth. For example, to compliment a friend's new outfit, although you don't really like the clothes, but you are just being polite. In this particular case, lying is the easiest way to avoid unpleasant situations. It would be unkind if you did not say anything at all but being honest and saying their clothes are ugly would be rude too. Therefore, telling a white lie like in the given example isn't that bad after all. Secondly, lying could also save lives. To illustrate, in the Second World War, some brave people had Jews in hiding in their homes. It is due to those selfless people some Jews managed to survive the war. If those people didn't risk their lives, lying to the Nazis and disobeying their orders, even more people would have died. Therefore, I think we should be thankful some people are dishonest from time to time. In conclusion, sometimes lying is better than speaking the truth Of course, people shouldn't be dishonest all the time, but in certain situations, it's acceptable to tell a lie.

In my opinion, it is better to have many teachers throughout the years. Each teacher has value, some problems teaching, so it is important for children and teenagers to have several teachers. I guess that any opportunity needs to be used. My daughters have different teachers, each one for each subject. My younger girl prefers the science teacher. My older girl rather has the math teacher, so for different children we need different teachers. In the future, they can meet other great teachers that will influence their whole lives. The trajectory of students, students, depends on the age, on the mood, and on the stage of life, so several teachers can help them. Despite these questions, I think that meeting different people is very important to learn to find challenges, so I think that the same teacher throughout the years would not be able to offer this for their lives.

Some people believe that zoos are good places to learn about animals, but belonging in nature is a good way. From my viewpoint, they both have their own benefits and drawbacks. To begin with, if a government provide zoos, people will have more chance to be in touch with animals, with the way they live and transformation. Even though you are not a zoologist, you can also learn about their life cycle and their strengths and weaknesses. For example, monkeys are almost like humans, they are 99.2% the same as humans. If no zoos are opened, people will never have a chance to study their behavior and features. On the other hand, animals should not be kept in cages which can affect their life cycle, reproduction, and even death. For instance, crocodiles, you can see that their life changing in nature and their transformation in zoos are thoroughly different. In nature, they have more strength and are wilder than in cages. Another example, keeping animals in a cage can affect their reproductive system due to the fact that the place is tiny and the mating is monotonous. I believe that if you want to research their lifestyles or life cycles, why not go to see them in their habitats? You can see not only their changes, but also natural landscapes and you can also take a selfie. For instance, in Singapore, they occupy people under ground water tunnel which was built under the Pacific Ocean. From there you can see any kinds of sea creatures, such as whales, sea cucumbers, jellyfish, etc. In conclusion, keeping animals in zoos has advantages and disadvantages, keeping in the zoos also have advantageous and disadvantageous, I prefer to keep them free.

The future school Do you like school, school life, the teachers, or the subjects? And also what did? I think some points might be changing in the future. Firstly, some schools will change to online classes, for example, rural schools. Usually, there are not enough students or the school is too far. Of course, the city or town schools will also change to the same thing. However, teachers who don't change to robots go on humans. Robot teachers can't make mistakes but they can't understand students' feelings. There are disadvantages to this type of schools. Students won't be able to talk to friends face to face or won't be able to get communication skills. And parent or grandparents need to stay home together with the children. In addition, I think the fixed school grade will disappear. If some students understand the subjects of a grade more than other students, they can go to the next grade quickly and they will graduate earlier than others. And then, their ability might be used by companies or politicians immediately. Schools are important for students. That's why they need to change much better way.

Health and wealth influence each other. In poor countries with no healthcare people try to stay alive and in rich countries they are healthy and change their body for beauty reasons. I agree with the statement: " It is more important to be healthy than rich." On the one hand, you cannot enjoy your riches if you are sick. On the other hand, you have no chance to get better if you do not have any money. In Germany, we have a really good health system and everyone can have a health insurance. It is different in America, with no access to healthcare for everyone. In that country, to be poor means that someone will eventually die. But I think health is the most important subject and we need to think about how to improve it. All in all, it is necessary to find a balance between wealth and health. Every person needs to find this balance on their own. However, it is also important to create or provide healthcare for more people. Nevertheless, health is the most important.

Working is inherent to our lives as when we reach the adult age, we need to get a job in order to earn money to survive. Only if you start your own company will you be more than just a simple employee, at least at the beginning of a career. Being a simple employee means you will have to submit yourself to the conditions the company you work for gives you. In some companies the employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles while in others there is a more open and modern design. For example, there are no walls separating co-workers from each other. Clearly, these two different models of offices have advantages and drawbacks: in the first example, you have more privacy and silence, and the environment promotes concentration; whereas in the second one you have the chance to take advantage of the interaction with your partners. It is easy to dialogue with the others and you never feel alone. Considering all I have mentioned before, if it were me, I would prefer to work in a cubicle as I would be more focused, and therefore, productive. If I needed help, I would go to the next office and ask for an opinion.

Hello everyone! Today I will talk about "The school of the future." I'm going to explain to you my personal opinion about this future school. First of all, I have two ways about the school of the future, the first is about technologies. Personally, I think the school of the future should be more technological because technologies develop very quickly in the world and also because technologies are really useful for many things; there is no doubt about it. For example, you can do your work more rapidly, you can search for everything, and also learn more easily thanks to the many websites on the internet. Moreover, in the future all students will have a computer or tablet for working in the classroom, I guess. On the other hand, I think school might be bigger and more big and more bulky therefore more students can study and improve their abilities. I mean it will be easier for a student to learn and exchange with his teacher in a bigger school.

Class dialogue is building a positive atmosphere for schooling, and better information is benefiting from effective communication between students.

Today I'll speak about education about the television show. Furthermore, for visual content TV is the greatest innovation. With technological development, school students are now engaged in educational entertainment. For starters, rhymes, videos for the children's science experiments, electronic games, etc. offers the students a varied education. Rhymes offer a general awareness and a greater understanding of culture. Images from the research initiative include a clearer picture of the laws of science and its method of practice. Study has indicated that a child playing video games has a broader adaptability of brain awareness as well as imagination than students not playing. Studies have claimed that recordings or images provide stronger and longer-lasting memories of the items. In addition, for student life, TV is the greatest example of modesty.

Today, like they did years ago, students decide to study in another country. This decision is particularly good because it is the best way to learn something. For example, studying a new language in a new country is the best method to improve yourself. However, it has a huge difficulty at the beginning, because you do not understand what other people tell you, or explain to you. After spending some time in that country the difficulty subsides, i. e. you understand what people tell you. However, there are also negative aspects of living in another country. One of them is that you have to follow their local traditions, which can be different from yours. Despite the difficulties, this is the best way to develop your skills and make new friends who can help you to learn faster.

Studying English is one of the most beautiful things to do. I started to say some words when I was 5 years old. Then when I was 8/9 years old my family and I decided to go on a trip. We went to America to see my uncle's family. When I went there, I was so surprised to see that I had native English-speaking cousins. I was so excited because that gave me a reason to prove myself. When I came back, I became the number one in English in my class. I was so happy to see my classmates so jealous of my skills. Later, I went to high school where I started to study English grammar. Once I realized I was able to make sentences, my decision was made: I had to get better in this language. Now I'm studying to pass the B2 exam.

That place is my favourite, but remembering that I did not go there is very painful. This was the best holiday I have had. I had the opportunity to listen and speak a little bit of English. That was epic and funny.

At the beginning of 2020, almost the whole world went into lockdown 'cause of the Covid-19 virus. Many people had to live inside to control the infection. Therefore, travel became impossible at this time. Travel will maybe return in the next year when we have a vaccine. But everyone will be careful about going overseas. I think travelers will visit some places in their country or go to some countries which control the pandemic successfully. Otherwise, after the pandemic, the economy will go into a depression, so people have to reduce travel cost by going to a country that has low prices. Those are the different ways of travelling in the near future. The next few years, when everything is going to be normal, the number of travelers will increase. I think they still want to travel to the countryside and the forest, which is the same thing as a few years ago because after the stressful quarantine people will want to breathe some fresh air. I think everyone still wants to have more experiences in the countryside. Finally, that is my opinion about " The Future of Travel."

Some people believe that studying for several years with the same teacher is superb, but having new teachers for each year is more advantageous. Based on my knowledge, I am going to outline the upsides of having the same teacher for several years. believe that when studying with the same teacher, students already understand their teacher's likes and dislikes, thus they will behave like good people. Students and teacher can keep in touch with each other like friendly, open-minded people without paranoia. If the teacher is young, she will treat her pupils like her brothers and sisters. However, Sometimes, same Besides that, it is mentioned that diversity in teachers has its own benefits and drawbacks. They believe that different teacher chase dissimilar styles and new methods which can make them more marks and favour, which is going to trouble to them if they are planning to the further studying. Besides that, it is mentioned that diverse teachers have their own benefits and more creative. Students will their mistakes gives them more marks and favour, which is going to trouble to them if they are planning to the further studying. Besides that, it is mentioned that diverse teachers have their own benefits and look up to the teachers, which can encourage them to study more and more. On the other hand, they might misunderstand what she is talking about. For instance, when I was young, my mother was encouraging me to get better experiences, hence, she pushed to her students forgiving their mistakes gives them more marks and favour, which is going to trouble to them if they are planning to the further studying. Besides that, it is mentioned that diverse teachers have their own benefits and drawbacks. They believe that different teacher chase dissimilar styles and new methods which can make them brain - storming and more creative. I did not use to know about their lectures, therefore I did not got sensationally high marks. And last but not least, some teachers want to show their powers to students will be terror and look up to the teachers which can boost them to study more and more. On the other hand, they might misunderstanding about how she is talking about. In my view, I prefer to go with the same teacher because the students and teacher have already built their relationships and got to know which students are weak in which subjects and which other students have strengths in others, which is why she can thoroughly control them to get a grade A+. So, in a nutshell, students having the same teacher for several years or having new teachers both has upsides and downsides. In my opinion, undoubtedly, I would definitely go for the same teacher for several years.

Hello Jack, Happy birthday to you. I would come to your celebration, but I promise you I'll come next year.

The majority of people are made for social contact and interaction. The walls of cubicles rob you from making these connections with your colleagues. You do get some additional space and privacy with walls, but this comes at a cost. When you open up your office, a couple of things will happen. People will be able to see one another. This means that you will not be able to slack anymore. You could get away with this in a cubicle. At the same time, you will be able to see your colleagues at work. This can give you the motivation to keep working. And when you need some help you can easily ask. The feeling at the office will be different. It will not only be everybody for himself but more a feeling of working in a group. It will create a more colleague-friendly environment. People in general do not prefer small and tight spaces. We come from ancestors who roamed around open fields. Having the ability to overlook your direct space, gives the feeling of safety and peace. You create this feeling by opening up your office. But it is important to do it the correct way. Start with giving everybody his own space. Do not place people directly in front of or next to each other. Otherwise, the threshold to get distracted will be lower. Natural light is important for a lot of people. Walls of cubicles are barriers for natural light. This is different in an open workspace.

There are secondary schools where you first need to spend a certain amount of time on charity work before earning your degree. This can, for example, mean that students help by giving English to refugees or maybe working at a homeless shelter. There are a lot of lessons students are able to learn from this type of work. Volunteer work teaches children to not only think about their own situation, but also about the situations of people less fortunate than them themselves. Not everybody has the same opportunities in life. A little help can make a lot of difference for somebody in need. Because of the fact that you need to do some volunteer work to graduate, it will force people (that would normally not do charity work) to try it. These students are pushed out of their comfort space. You never know, maybe it will even change their opinion about it. It can maybe broaden their view. Starting volunteer work at a younger age will make it feel more normal. It will also increase the chance that students will do more volunteer work in the future. We need new volunteers every year. Inspiring young people to step up can make a difference in maintaining a steady stream of volunteers.

Speaking is thinking. The way people think can be measured by their spoken language. If people tell a lie, they cannot be trusted. To lie is an unacceptable action, except in emergency conditions. Always telling the truth is important. People can obtain trust from others by always telling the truth. Trust is an important reward in a society. When we are studying at a university or working in a company, obtaining trust is a top priority once we enter a new environment. Lying, in opposite, will put us in a marginal zone from which we can easily drop off. Telling the truth is also safer than telling a lie. Although it is difficult to tell the truth in some conditions, telling the real case not only makes us unloaded physically but also mentally. The habit of telling the truth -- without any addition and deduction - will strengthen our quality of life. Correct data will deliver the right decisions. In contrast, fake data will result in the wrong decisions. There is a case when telling a lie is acceptable. A lie can be accepted when someone is in danger and telling the truth will put their safety in danger. In this case, the only way is to tell a lie. Nevertheless, everything should be explained in truth once the problem is solved.

Currently, I think you have to speak a foreign language more than in the whole of the last decade. Indeed, speaking another language is very useful for many things, such as for your job or to get around; there is no doubt about it. Therefore, some people try to learn a new language like a native speaker of their target language. Indeed, today more and more people are learning a foreign language to find a job more easily. To give you an example, in 2012, when I worked for a travel company, I didn't speak English but I had to do it. So I was learning English until I spoke this very well because I needed that to communicate with some foreigners. Moreover, I think today you should be able to speak a foreign language because of globalisation. To explain to you what globalization means, this is a kind of opened border and an exchange program between several countries. This is a political device made to do more business and also have more exchange between some countries, like in Europe with the "Schengen space." Consequently, you may have a relationship with someone who doesn't speak your language, and this is actually true, by the way.

Write and Improve provides a huge number of topics and they divide all the topics into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Users, per their own convenience, can choose the topic and write up to 300 words. They have also provided topics related to business. This category is useful for professional people who want to improve their business English. The topics in this category are few and limited in subject. They must include more variety of topics so that more practice related to business English can be performed. One more feature they have included is the test zone. This category is for people who are preparing for IELTS. Here, the topics are listed similar to what comes in the IELTS exam. Sadly, this category is chargeable, and after one review they continuously ask for a subscription. The most important parts of this portal are feedback and progress. Here, they check, mark the mistakes, and give suggestions for correction. The overall review system is excellent but lacks in detail. The highlighted part does not mention the mistake in detail, and also does not suggest the correct way of writing, however it shows the proficiency and CEFR level. To summarise, this is the best website I have found where both topics and proofreading features are available. I request Write and Improve to include more business topics and provide a more detailed review system.

I think television can also educate people, not only entertain them. The purpose of television is to entertain, but learning is one of the entertainments. On TV, there are news, discussion, and education programs. As TV broadcasts them, people take in a wide variety of information passively, even though they are not interested in it. It not only broadcasts them, but also explains if we need in detail. People acquire wanting information just watching TV. Or, it could be the threshold of learning new subjects. Moreover, we could learn even from entertainment programs, for example from comedy and music. We could get the knowledge of how to occur laugh or compose songs. When we watch TV from a different perspective, we could find new things which we had not noticed. Everything is a seed of learning. TV will never be a tiring device, it should be enjoyable forever.

Among children, video games are more popular than they were in the last decade. Some people believe that video games can be a negative influence on children and other people do not believe it.

Most people do not control their children; hence, the children will be playing some 18 + video games, the children will be playing some 18 + video games, thrilling or ghost hunting which could be a threat to them. Sometimes, someone who plays video games too much will behave in real life like in games. For example, I read in some article, a young man, just around 10 years old, who played PUBG games.

It seems to me that working in cubicles is more effective because when you work with no walls separating one and the others, it’s going to be noisy. Even the sound of someone clicking a keyboard by your side might make you out of focus. Focus is really important for us while doing something. You can be more productive when you are all by yourself thinking about what you’re going to finish. Even though you can’t communicate with anybody, all your attention moves to your duty so you can easily focus on it. Sometimes, being alone by ourselves makes us know ourselves better than ever.

On the other hand, I think the website needs to be more specific about a candidate's mistakes and give better suggestions. For example, I searched for one of the collocations that the website detected as a mistake, and I found that it was right. Maybe that collocation could not be embedded in that particular topic.

When I was a child, video games were already quite widespread, but over time their spread has increased. This increase is due, on one hand, to technological progress, on the other, to parents who always get busier and busier every day and don't have time - nor the patience - to be with their children. I've often seen exhausted parents giving their mobile phone to their children so that they would stay quiet for - at least - the following thirty minutes. I've also seen children who didn't care about going out with their friends, preferring instead to play with their X-box. This is a serious problem and governments should try to solve it, getting the very useful help of childhood psychologists and schools. I think children should be encouraged to spend time outside, playing, running, going on the roaller, or biking. They need to understand what it means to be in nature; they need to have time to explore what they are surrounded by. Moreover, having contact with nature can help to develop stronger antibodies, which are always useful. Video games, if abused, can bring a child to believe what happens in them is real, so that maybe they can learn to believe that social relationships should be based only on social media interaction, or that it's fair and consented by law to kill, bit or invest by car someone. Children should play video games for a limited and defined period of the day; also to preserve their sight. Video games are, however, a good option to spend some time of the day, maybe one hour or a little more, to socialize with friends if it's raining and it's not possible to go outside, and to develop confidence with technological instruments from a young age, because learning while having fun is always a good thing.

I agree with volunteer work as a requirement to graduate. For many years volunteer work has been a requirement that high schools students must complete in order to graduate. When I was a high school student, I worked in the school's library in order to clean, classify and arrange the books. Others planted a garden in the school, taught mathematics to younger students or helped in the City Hospital. The experience taught me to manage my time. Also, I learned to be tidier and responsible because of the classification and arrangement work. I learned that I had a boss who managed the work. I understand that a boss should teach but sometimes he doesn't do it. And finally, the boss always makes the rules.

The question is, is exercise important for health, or are there other things as important as this? In this essay I will discuss all causes and draw my conclusion. In terms of reason, it is said that exercise is really necessary. The main reason they give is that to make our health better, we have to do it every day, whether you are busy or free. To illustrate that, exercise helps the blood circulation work effectively. In other words, it increases the effectiveness of our heart. Because of that we have good health. Moreover, others believe that to have good health you have to focus on many things, like food, relationships, work, and exercise. This is because all of these things affect your health. In conclusion, some people say exercise is the only cause of having good health, but others think there is more then one reason to have a healthy body. Therefore, I believe that exercise is necessary to have a healthy body, but other things like unhealthy food and hard work could affect our health if we are not paying attention.

It goes without saying that there are divergent kinds of offices, after all, each country has its own culture, in addition to requiring different necessities. It is widely accepted that closed workstations are a good alternative when the profession requires more concentration. However, could narrow cabins really be an advantage? Would a fellowship be more pleasant and productive for an undertaking? Let us focus, firstly, small offices are generally considered to be a work environment that is very environment a lot of preserved, and thereby useful. A good illustration of this are some stations in Japan, where there is great productivity in tiny places, whereas culturely culturally they are accustomed to living in small rooms. In other words, this was the path for Japan to become an enormous worldwide economy. In spite of doing this, does the separation with walls truly have some result? On the other hand, having a conversation between co-workers could not only be agreeable, but also constructive. For example, in a business meeting the interaction between staff might generate an amazing idea. A common opinion is that to create a collective lifestyle, putting it another way, living together, brings mental and physical health to the population, thus giving countless benefits to the company, in relation to plans, concepts and, ultimately, theories. A great environment makes a huge difference anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, I believe that to be most effective is very relative, there are as many qualities in one way as in other. Therefore, the best mode to drive this decision is to study the labour market where the undertaking is inserted, only by understanding that each group has its own necessities and culture.

I find this topic interesting. I have never given a thought to it but I have my choice related to the office furniture for employees. I will list the important points which should be considered for finalizing the office design that is most appropriate for employees. These are:- 1) As employees sit with their co-workers, adequate distance must be maintained. 2) Two employees who are sitting adjacent should not be able to see each other's computers or work. 3) All employees can be seen from one end. 4) The hall should be airy enough for maintaining good hygiene. 5) People who are dealing with clients must have seating arrangements in front of them. 6) We must maintain sufficient space between two workstations. Considering the all the points as mentioned above, we can think of the best design for office furniture. I suggest the design which has two desks i. e., two employees can work simultaneously. Both desks are next to each other but separated by a wall. Each desk has chairs for clients in front of the employees. By providing a sufficient gap between the tables, optimum space can be utilized in the hall and the office will be airy enough at the same time.

The fundamental idea sounds great. I support the idea that kids should do some work. There are so many children that do not know what work really is. The only problem is the word "volunteer." Why call it that? Is it some kind of political correctness? If they have to do it, it is not volunteer work. And it is OK. Let's be honest and call it duty. Duty is an important part of life, too. Children can learn the basic aspects of their duty in the school. Without these programmes the children wouldn't be able to value the hard work which is done be working people around them. The hard work will make them humble and it is the most important part of the idea. Children should be humble or they will be humbled. Nothing is for free. Their parents can buy them stuff but to graduate they have to work. And that is right.

Do I want to live a long calm life or a shorter more intense life? I have never thought about this. I understand some people may have different opinions but if I could have a choice I would answer I would prefer the first option. I wish to live a long life because I want to see how the world will change one year after another. I do like advantages as well but I believe I can do my hobby and stay calm. First of all, a few years ago I started searching for information about meditation and this is the subject I'm very passionate about. This is why I don't feel like I need to look for an extremely intense situation in my life. I feel nice and stable during a normal day of doing nothing. I mean nothing extreme. My dream life is the possibility to wake up any time that is suitable for me without rush and stress, make myself a cup of coffee and slowly start to concentrate on my work I have to do . I do have a cycling passion but it is just city cycling and, to be honest, I don't think it is extremely dangerous. I wouldn't consider this hobby as dangerous at all. To summarise, I wish to see how the future generation will change. This is why the length of my life is important to me.

I am going to talk about the most significant holiday I have ever had. I will explore in this essay what makes me say it was the best holiday. Firstly, my experience of life at my young age was not a smooth road due to the fact that I had been staying with my paternal aunty and uncle in Myanmar (Yangon). Because my parents had been earning money in Taiwan I had few chances to meet with them, only once in five years. When I was young, technology has not advanced very far. Nowadays, you can keep in touch with friends or family in all countries with internet applications, such as Messenger, Viber, Wechat, etc. I used not to know about my caring, warm, sweet-hearted, and patient parents and I was stuck with a feeling of loneliness, monotony and cold. I wished I could stay with my parents every day; it was my dream. However, my dreams were going to come true because I got a chance to go to my parents' residence in Taiwan. Taiwan is the heart of Asia with a pack of skyscrapers, among them Taiwan 101, which is the tallest and most breathtaking, also included in the top ten of the world's tallest buildings. Other famous things are the night market, shopping districts, bubble tea, Chinese cuisine, and snacks. I was on cloud nine going to Taiwan. When I got there it was more sensational than I expected. My parents came to Taoyuan airport and waited to meet me. When I saw them, I ran and embraced them. I stayed with them for about 5 or 6 months and had the most awesome experience in my life. I hung out with them doing things, such as shopping, eating, and playing some games. When I had to go back to Myanmar, they gave me a lot of souvenirs, snacks, gadgets, and by the way, I got an iPhone as a present from my mother. In a nutshell, that holiday was the most exciting and tremendous experience of my life. I will be planning to go back to Taiwan to meet my parents again.

Write and Improve In April, I realized that my English level was very bad and I wanted to improve this . My sister advised me to use this website to write more often in English. At the beginning, it was very difficult for me because my vocabulary was very limited. Now, with the practice, it is easier even if I make a lot of mistakes. I'm trying to practise each day, it is difficult but I am succeeding for the moment. I like the diversity of the exercises on this website because there is a lot of writing to be done. We can progress slowly and the corrections help me improve my level. It could be better , for example, they have no lesson to discover new vocabulary. Finally, I obviously recommend a classmate to try it because it is a lot of fun and instructive.

Nowadays many teenagers have become hardless and are not interested in the life of members of their family and friends. They pay attention to life which is on social media. In my opinion, it is a wonderful idea that some high schools require students to do some compulsory volunteer work. Firstly, volunteer work teaches responsibility for others. It puts emphasis how important it is to give a helping hand to homeless or elderly people. It could improve relationships between grandparents and grandchildren. Teenagers are able to learn many useful abilities from the experience which comes from their grandparents. Secondly, many factories or corporations are looking for people who are keen on volunteer work. It shows them that the candidate has a wide range of discipline and responsibility. What's more, they know how to find a balance between work and relaxation. On the other hand, if teenagers do something under pressure they became rundess. They ignore the advice of their parents or teacher. Next, they try to invent as many excuses as they can to avoid volunteer work. It is a waste of time for them. To sum up, doing volunteer work at school is useful. Students might develop their personality. As a result they become more responsible and sensitive citizens of country and more attractive candidates for a working company.

This school year represents a challenge for me, specifically in terms of learning English. This year has to be the year to reach my goals in reference to the subject of English, I am applying all my enthusiasm and optimism to achieve my goal, which is to be fluent in English. I have identified some strengths, for example, I am pleased with my reading skills and also with my vocabulary. Although I am still feeling stuck, I suppose I need to improve my level of confidence when I am talking with native English speakers. My main weakness is writing, I feel overwhelmed when I need to start writing. This is something that I really need to improve. The most difficult part for me is starting to write. This process itself is not easy even in your native language. In addition, I have a lot of grammar rules in my mind, sometimes I feel this is too much. My personal achievement is to pass the IELTS Academic test. I need to get a high score; without this I am going to be stuck in my career. My plan is to dedicated some hours a day, focusing my learning on reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I promise that I shall do my best to achieve my goals.

The best holiday of my life was 10 years ago. My family and I went to Portugal for a week. Evidently, Portugal is a great holiday destination because of the landscape and the ocean. Still, there is another reason why it is my favourite trip. Since I was a little girl, I had dreamed of swimming with a dolphin once. This dream came true during my vacation in Portugal. A few days after we arrived, we visited a water park called "Zoomarine." The park itself was already pretty fun. There were various water slides and you could watch different shows. However, the best about this park was the possibility to swim with dolphins. After a short instruction we were able to join them in their pool. I even had the opportunity to swim with one of them alone. As you can see, this was an experience I had been looking forward to a lot. As a result, this was the best holiday ever and even one of the best moments in my whole life.

Last year was a fantastic one and I learned a lot of new things and I improved my English skills significantly. Because of all that happened in the previous year I want to thank my teacher and all my classmates for their help. Of what I learned I'm pleased especially with two skills: speaking and listening. Therefore, the remaining two skills, writing and reading are the areas where I want to improve in this new year. I realise that to improve it will take lots of work to be done, but I'm ready to do all my best and achieve the goals. I also will do lots of homework and lots of practice. My plan is to practise my writing online by doing different kinds of exercises and to read newspapers to practice my reading. I'm sure this new year will be a good one for me and I wish every one of my classmates all the luck.

Dear Jack, How are you? Are you alright? I'm so glad that I received your letter about your birthday. It's too late but I also say to you: "Happy Birthday"! For me, my birthday is so simple but it is quite happy because my family and my best friends are around me to say "Happy Birthday" to me. I usually have a very small birthday celebration. I have just invited my best friends to come to my birthday party. Like you, after the meal they all sing "Happy Birthday" to me. Then I make a wish before the cake and blow out all the candles. After that, we have a cake. The atmosphere is so awesome. We usually have a funny story to tell each other. We also dance together. That is so great.

In my opinion, I think having the same teacher for several years is a bad idea. I think students benefit more from having new teachers each year for a simple reason. After their studies, in their job, they will be obliged to work with other colleagues, not just one during their career. Moreover, according to me, it is more interesting to work with new teachers each year because it allows us to discover new ways of thinking. They can bring more knowledge than one teacher. Of course, if students don't like the teacher maybe they will like the new one. Even for the teacher it is more interesting to discover new students. I know this because my parents are teachers. Finally, it is helpful for the two parties because they can meet new people. If students like a teacher, they can keep in contact with him. If they don't like him, they are not obliged to keep in touch.

Zoos are places where animals live in different circumstances. There are a lot of zoos around the world with different priorities and characteristics. Nowadays, most zoos work with endangered creatures or abused animals from circuses or contraband, but there are also a few zoos which function as an entertainment place specifically, and that's why people often argue about animals being enclosed in unnatural habitats called zoos. They say that species who are separated from their freedom suffer several consequences like stress, mental illness, or even suicide. Animal protectors also debate about the space where animals live. They argue that even if zoos have the "adequate" space and conditions to keep animals, they are still in captivity. However, zoos on the contrary say that they do important work to preserve wildlife. Zoos say that their breeding and rescue programmes help to preserve endangered animals or study different illnesses and their treatments. They even do important work teaching children about the value of biodiversity, giving them a real experience with animals and wildlife to create environmental awareness. As I see it, zoos have pros and cons for wildlife. These kinds of places many times help animals who have been abused or need to be rehabilitated to be reinserted into their natural environment. Even though zoos help a lot to preserve wildlife they still keep animals captive. That's why I strongly believe that there should be an agreement between zoos and hunters to respect wildlife. I mean that people should help and treat vulnerable creatures and try to re-insert them into their natural environments as soon as possible using zoos as a tool to preserve and help vulnerable animals.

These days, mobile phones have become an integrated part of our daily life. Wherever we go or whatever we do, a mobile phone always remains with us. The technology associated with mobile phones keeps on upgrading and we can perform a lot of things. The mobile phone was invented for communication and now, it can perform all kinds of jobs for which we use a computer or laptop. The various social media apps, which are very attractive and very difficult to get rid of, are the major factor which has enhanced the use of mobile phones. I do not agree with banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. The town council wants to limit the use of mobile phones in public places so that people around the mobile phone user should not get disturbed. I would suggest that instead of banning mobile phones, the town council must start an awareness program regarding the benefit of limited uses of mobile phones in public places. Besides this, the town council should start penalizing the people who use their mobile phones for something other than the emergency work. For more awareness, posters and advertisements should be done in every public place, they help the user to understand the importance of limited mobile phone use. After a few weeks of advertising, the town council can start penalizing the users and gradually people will cultivate the habit of not using mobile phones in public places..

There are always arguments about zoos. On the one hand, they're really appreciated, especially by children, on the other, they're strongly criticized, especially by young people and animal activists. Zoos shouldn't exist the way they actually do. We always see animals living in places - or rather cages - in really different conditions from their original habitats. Animals seem to live in another world, far away from our reality. They often have an astonished expression, as if they have been hypnotized. They look tired and their movements are extremely slow. Captivity deprives them of their natural freedom and makes them dolls to admire behind glass. I was taken to zoos too when I was a child, and sometimes I've visited them more recently. When I was a child I was excited - as is normal for a child - to see animals I didn't even know existed, but right now I understand that it's not good. Right now, six bears are living in the Orecchiella Park, locked in cages of 60 square meters and forced to stay all day under the sun; they seem to be suffering quite a lot from the heat of the summer. In zoos, animals lose their predatory abilities too, because they always get food, both from visitors - who give it to them despite the prohibition - and from the zoo's employees. I prefer more safaris and natural parks, because the animals that live there can benefit from better conditions and walk and run in larger spaces, often quite similar to their natural habitats.

It is clear that the future of travel their own have different and the same. In this essay, I am going to demonstrate different and the same. Based on my knowledge, there will be four main sources of means of long-distance travel, such as buses (coaches), normal trains or undergrounds, airplanes, and cruise ships. The coach system is almost perfect, which is why there is no way to change a lot. Even though the normal train system is slow, farmers, cultivation people, and those living on the outskirts rely on that due to the fact that it is cheap and punctual. Underground railways are absolutely established, they will not change in the future. Most people believe that there will be a supersonic speed train appearing soon. On the other hand, airway systems will not be dead because we all rely on aircraft to travel abroad. Some scientists are planning an announcement about gigantic aircraft with faster speed and ones that could allow us to board more than one hundred people. And last, but not least, cruise is also support a main in transportation. I read in some article in a newspaper that cruises will be more luxurious with a playground, swimming pools, and shopping centers, etc. and also fasterand fast, accurate than in the past. Secondly, hotels are the biggest change in the future. Instead of humans they are planning to replace people with robots. For instance, in China, some pricey restaurants, especially hotpot ones, if you order some side dishes, they come with robots and are served at your table. And another example, in Japan, hotel staff are running with all robots, can show you which room you reserved and give you some lunch, a dinner box, and morning breakfast. My personal point of view is that food will be changing consequently, the traditional cuisine will be replaced with fast food, which is what concerns me most. will be changing in the near future.

Studying in another country has recently been a growing trend among students at different levels. Although this experience has some positive effects on a student's life, there are some drawbacks to this. On the one hand, in order to study abroad, students must learn a new language and overcome language barriers in the new country, which is not only a very valuable experience but also helps them to develop their interpersonal skills, since they will be in touch with a new culture and contact new people in a language other than their mother tongue. Furthermore, the experience of studying overseas can be a bright spot in a student's resume and enhance their employment chances in the future. On the other hand, being away from family can be a difficult aspect for some students. When they feel the lack of family support, they may suffer from homesickness and depression which affects their performance at the university or college. Furthermore, many students decide to not return to their own countries after graduation and that will negatively affect their countries and cause some problems, such as a lack of educated young people, who are such a treasure for society.

I have studied English since 2018. My first teacher was called Vinicius and he wasn't a native teacher. He hadn't been in the USA or England and his only experience with the language was speaking with a native, but I really liked him. Two years later, I changed my English teacher. Now, my sister teaches me and it's been working it all. As she actually lives in the USA, she has daily contact with native speakers. So, she can share with me all the knowledge that she's learned on the streets or in her job. Then, with my experience, I can just see positive points in having new teachers, because my current teacher is better than the last one. If, instead the change of teachers had resulted in a worse teacher now, I think that I wouldn't share this idea. Thus, having new teachers can work if you trust in your new teacher. If you're sure that you'll win with that change of teachers, go on!

My English teacher suggested I improve my English writing using Write&Improve, a free online platform. Write and Improve is extremely easy to use, intuitive, and suitable for every English learner. It is very inclusive because there are writings for beginners and both for intermediate and advanced. I've really appreciated the possibility to check my writings in real time to correct the mistakes I made. There are different marks for different mistakes, and this is very useful. There are different kinds of mistakes: wrong words, suspicious words that perhaps are not suitable for a certain context, and also entire sentences which seem incorrect in their construction. Mistakes can be corrected in real time and it is possible to check writings infinite times, trying to make them better and better. In my experience, it would be more useful if, when the algorithm detected an incorrect sentence, it would also suggest how to improve it. I strongly recommend the use of Write and Improve, because in my experience it really helped to improve my English writing. When I started I was a B2 level, now I am a C1.

More and more students choose to study abroad and most of them always have great experiences. Here in Italy we name this kind of experiences "Erasmus" or "cultural exchanges." They usually last at least three months, but most times students study abroad for circa six months. Some of them, the most motivated ones, stays outside of Italy for one year. There are a lot of advantages for those who choose to study in a foreign country. First of all, learning another language and getting to know another culture. Indeed learning a language living in a country where this language is not spoken could become quite difficult, because people haven't the chance to practise in real life. Moreover, facing the people of a place and their customs is really helpful to understand the culture of the place and allows us to come closer to the language too. Going away from home means getting older too: guys start to organize their days, to clean their rooms, and to pay for the light, rubbish, gas, and water. They eventually learn to live as adults, out of the cup of glass in which they have lived for all their lives. Erasmus is also a good opportunity to meet new people, which maybe will help in an eventual future job. However, studying abroad can also have disadvantages. We Italian people are really close to our families and their absence sometimes is so intense that someone could suffer from loneliness. Moreover, in some cases, going away from home could become an excuse to run away from responsibilities and duties or to live a life outside the rules. A lot of students think that what happens in Erasmus stays in Erasmus and they use that period just to have fun and not to study. Studying abroad could be the greatest of experiences with the right approach.

Why don't we hold a party and invite some best friends to come? We can eat and talk together. We can also share the sadness and the challenges in the study process with each other. We can also sing karaoke and dance together under the orange light of candlelight. I can imagine the atmosphere at that time will be very awesome and great. You and me can plan for the party. What do you think about the idea? Tell me your opinion as soon as possible. I'm looking forward to your reply. Much love, Nguyen Nguyen.

My favourite season of the year is winter, but only when I stay in town . Because I like to use winter clothes and it is very easy to get warm. I mean you can put on a coat and gloves and the problem is resolved. When it is a cold and rainy day there is nothing better than going to watch a movie with your girlfriend or with your friends. Also, I love cold weekends and going to Starbucks early in the morning and drinking a hot coffee while I read a good book. But if I can go on vacation, I love summer and going to the seaside with an amazing and beautiful beach with white sand and a deep blue ocean. I like to sunbathe while I read a good book too. And at night, I like going out to have dinner at a seafood restaurant.

In my opinion, studying in another country is a very good idea. In 2016, I went to Canada for my law and history studies; it was my best experience in another country. This allows students to discover new countries, new cultures, new friends, and new relationships. It is very important when we are young to understand the way of thinking of foreigners. It opens our eyes! Of course, in another country, we can learn a new language or visit some monuments. Moreover, going to another country shows you what you like and what you miss in your own country. An example, for me, when I was in Canada, the thing that I missed the most was the bread! Of course, my family too! To conclude, during a trip to a foreign country, remember that the most important thing is to have fun! It is a great experience!

Some people believe that employees who work in enclosed work stations or open design stations on their own have benefits and drawbacks. In this essay I am going to outline two main reasons for enclosed work stations or cubicles and open design stations. Based on my knowledge, I am going to demonstrate the advantages of enclosed work stations or cubicles. If there is that kind of work station, the employees will have more space and can put anything they want there, such as some snacks, water bottles and personal things. Recently, every country has had to face with Noval coronavirus, everyone has to stay at a distance. Enclosed work stations can easily protect us from that virus due to the fact that there is more distance and we have less chance to be in touch with people. However, they not only need space but also need a fortune to make the rooms, which need air-conditioning or ventilation fans to clean the fresh office air. They have to communicate with some acquaintances, workers and colleagues by phone. Besides that, I must mention the upsides of open design stations. They can communicate, help each other without any phones or technical devices. In the open design work stations, air could circulate and we can get more fresh air. The employer needs to rent only a small place where there can also be so many office desks and they won't need a lot of exhaust fans and air-conditioning. On the other hand, employees might not have personal space and if she puts some experience things like a mobile phone, she has to take care of that. Nowadays, coronavirus infects at a least 20 meters, so if someone gets it, everybody will be infected within 20 seconds. So, in a nutshell, those that following parts are the upsides and downsides of enclosed work stations and open design stations. It is just depends on your personal preference which stations are more effective.

Music and schools. This topic reminds me of my years in high school. And, to be honest, I hated music classes. However, there is serious dichotomy. Don't take me wrong, I really love music. I can't sing or play any instrument but I need to listen to music every day. Still, music classes used to be torture for me. Why is that? I think that problem is that the school makes you listen. You have to listen how to play and how to sing. This is not the proper way to approach music. It is the same with books. I have got my own little library. I love to read books. But in the high school we had mandatory books. The word mandatory. Once something is mandatory you don't like it, even if it is really great. So I would recommend voluntary music lessons only for those kids who want to learn something more. You can't and shouldn't impose music!

In this essay, I am going to outline two main problems about all doctors' desire to work in urban areas where they can make money roll in, but in rural regions there are not enough doctors. Based on my knowledge, I am going to demonstrate the difference between urban and rural regions. The first thing is money, due to the fact that a city center can give you a lot of money especially in a month, more than $50000 dollars or more. Nevertheless, in rural areas, money is last income, so they could not spend too much on medical health. The second one is convenient, if she works in the city center, she could rely on public transportation such as a taxi, subway or city-bike. However, in the outskirts, they only can trust the tuktuk or motorbike, which take ages to commute from one district to another district. And also, the motorcycle is the most dangerous thing for transportation because every year in rural areas people die because of motorbike accidents. On the one hand, working hours in the downtown takes only six to eight hours a day on duty and in hospitals where they have so many shifts, such as morning, mid-day or night. On the other hand, in the countryside, it is so strange. Consequently, it is only one doctor with two or one nurses to struggle for a 3-month or 6-month shift which is pretty hard to control. From my view point, the government or each medical university or college should be responsible for each branch state. For instance, if she lives in the suburbs, she had better work in suburban regional hospitals. Do not give them a choice. And the second one, control the amounts of salaries which can separate crowded doctors in the city center. If a nurse has one year's experience, she might earn $20000 dollars a year. The third one, fix the roads and providing a subway or a round district bus in the countryside. That kind of thing could fix not only the long hours commuting but also long hours on duty. So, in a nutshell, the nutshell, that following things could fix all the problems of packing doctors in the city center and every region will be balanced.

If you want to study at university you should be able to live on your own. It isn't like high school. No one cares about you and you have to study by yourself. And no one should care about your living either. It is great if your parents support you but you don't need "mamahotel." But to be honest I am not the best person to ask. I am studying at a military university and it is a really different way of life. I do not have to buy clothes or pay for my flat. I am living in the barracks with the whole regiment. I receive a salary every month but I have to work for forty hours a week. I do not have holidays. Our holidays are in the form of field exercises. But I think that all of that has taught me independence and I am glad for that. I don't understand how somebody could live with their parents in his or her thirties.

I totally agree with this statement. Unless we are healthy, we don't have the opportunity to spend money. We can discuss the importance of money only under good conditions. I have three reasons to support my opinions. Firstly, why is money important? We spend money to buy something. This action enriches our mind and as a result, our lives. If we are sick, we cannot fill our heart just with satisfaction. People are eager to acquire a healthy body instinctively. Secondly, we try anything to earn money with a healthy body. I have heard of many entrepreneurs who had been poor but succeeded in the end. With health and patience, it is possible for us all to be billionaires. Thirdly, if we stay healthy we are satisfied with our life regardless of being short of money. I know it is mostly a capitalistic world, but we have the organizations which take after each other. I hope everyone in this world seeks their health to live a happy and satisfying life.

Some schools oblige their students to study music and to play a musical instrument. For example, in France any student from 10 to 14 years old takes music lessons. Other countries do not have the same politics, and don't see the point in learning about music. In my opinion, students should have to study music but not to learn how to play a musical instrument. Of course, studying music and learning how to play a musical instrument can help students to develop creativity and amusement. Like any art, music has the power to be universal and everyone can enjoy some of it. Music can spread a message and it can be addressed to anyone. Being aware of what music has to offer is very important. Learning about music will open the mind of young students, and they will discover another kind of culture, or reinforce what they already know. There are many ways to study music, like learning how to read music or learning about former famous singers or musicians, or even singing some songs. Some students might discover a new hobby, and as it happened to me, study music outside the walls of school. Playing a musical instrument can encounter some difficulties to organise. Most musical instruments are very expensive, and most schools can't afford such an expense. I believe if only rich schools can make it happen, it will worsen inequalities between students. Of course, if states are funding all the equipment, I believe every student should learn a musical instrument. It will give them new skills and it will open their minds to art and to music culture. It is always difficult to give a sharp opinion in this kind of matter. I am only speaking with my former experience.

Some people say if you have plenty of money, you can buy anything you want. This statement is partly true, but being healthy is what you cannot buy with money. Imagine you have terminal cancer. No matter how much money you have, any treatment you can afford today may not be able to cure it. For example, Steve Jobs, one of the co-founders of Apple, was extremely wealthy, but he died of pancreas cancer. Money cannot always resolve health problems. That said, being rich enables you to beef up your health. It costs you a decent amount of money to eat healthy food, to get regular check-ups, and to receive medical treatment. If you are poor, you have to work under terrible labor conditions, so even working in a spiritually healthy environment calls for you to be wealthy. I think that though being healthy is more important than being rich, being healthy requires being rich, at least not poor.

Some people consider that students must study music and learn to play a musical instrument but other students do not bother to study music and musical instruments. In this essay, I am going to outline the upsides of studying music and musical instruments. Based on my knowledge, music is power and people can feel that nature with melody is the perfect one on the earth. Music could make all individual people full of energy and strength. As a consequence, some people may say "music is part of their life." Moreover, if you are feeling alone or depressed, you can open full of energetic and lively songs which can give you up. And also, some types of music like sleep or meditation songs could calm your mind and you could let your hair down. Some people say that they have to sleep with music. If their sleep is without music, they could not sleep the whole night because of music power. Music is key to create a whole kind of meanings in one piece of music, for instance, national anthems which are full of meanings including sadness, dynamism and strength. And last, but not least, music is desired by most people in the 21st century, not only in Asia but also all over the world. Thus, in China and Taiwan, music is the most hard to get into and the price is higher than others. From my view point, why don't we study music? If you have free time, do not waste it and keep trying music, which could give you more opportunities. I think all students had better study music due to the fact that they are going to know how beautiful the music melody is and when they feel alone that can liven them up. If somebody asks me " will you study music?" I will undoubtedly say "Yes." So, in a nutshell, the following keys show why we should study music. " Music is lovely and marvellous."

Let me introduce my personal opinion. It is important to say that I am studying at a military university and it is a bit of a different education system. Our military university is part of our defence forces, so it prepares soldiers for their duty. With that you are not allowed to study at a foreign civil university. So if you want to study abroad you have to choose some of the military schools. It is true that it can be useful to know tactics of other armies. But we are offered to study only in countries like Austria. Their armed forces are not equal to ours at all. I don't believe that Czech soldiers can profit from such education. In my opinion, the only reason why students want to study at a foreign military university is just entertainment and money. We are studying important things about our future job every day. It is based on our armed forces. You can't learn such things somewhere else and you can't catch up with the rest of the class. It is because you will miss some important practical lessons.

The main reason why most doctors want to work in cities is, obviously, money. In fact, I believe that money is what makes most people do something in life. Moreover, in the countryside there is the disadvantage of only having contact with older patients that need more care and attention than younger ones. In order to improve the situation, doctors would like to be rewarded with prizes, but not only monetary ones, though. Maybe, a welcoming measure would be the possibility of creating their own medical projects, even when working in these small villages.

People think that money gives happiness. I personally think that being healthy is much more valuable and important. First of all, money can buy a lot and make your life easier, but it will not buy your health. In my opinion, we should be physically active as much as possible and try to find that spare 30 min for exercise at least 3 times a week. Nowadays, processed and unhealthy food, stressful situations, pollution, and a busy life can affect our wellness. And money cannot change that. But we can by simply eating more healthily, changing bad habits, or avoiding fast foods. Personally, being healthy means much more to me than being rich. I believe that I can avoid poor health conditions through an active lifestyle. To sum up, I truly believe that being healthy is more important than being rich. I personally would love to live as long as possible, to see my children and future grandchildren grow and to make memories of those priceless moments which money could not buy.

To be honest, I don't like zoos. It is because all the animals in zoos seem to be dead in their eyes. Having said that, people visiting there seem to have fun seeing a lot of rarely seen animals. Do you think they show us their real life in a cage? Do you think we can recognize their habits, culture, and favorite games in zoos? I believe lions in nature run fast and never sit down on the ground all day long. I know every animal in nature struggles to find food and never waits to be fed. As long as we lock them up in zoos, we will never know animals' real instinct. I think we should figure out another way to see animals. A safari park is better to see them, but they are "fed" eventually, so we can't see their "real life." If you want to learn about animals, you should go to forests or savannas and get to know them; they are really ferocious.

The issue of volunteer work is widely debated, with some students claiming that it is for university students or those who have a lot of money. However, I personally agree with this, and I will explain why in this essay. Firstly, doing volunteer work is full of benefits that outweigh the disadvantages. This is not only for students but also for the majority. It can give you real life skills especially communication skills and socialisation. Most of the students are weak in communication skills for presentations or at the stage when they have already gained experience in volunteering which can fix their panic. For instance, in volunteer work you have to go to every place such as low poverty, suburban regions and the countryside, where places people are being given about doing and not doing things in front of a pack of people. That kind of competence can fix their shyness and panic. Some students are not good at socialization if they lack parents, or a single person must join volunteer work which gives them a lot of strengths and knowledge. That work not only can build your personal skills but also give you sweet smiles or wishes from donatee. I do appreciate that some students think alternatively, saying that it is better to study instead of doing volunteer work. Volunteer work is only needed for undergraduate or postgraduate students to get better credit scores and who have already had a rich person have to do this work. So, in a nutshell, I believe that doing volunteer work livens you up and gets you more new experiences and to know about how to consider other people's feelings.

There is a new aptitude in the Italian schools that is becoming always more common, and this is the opportunity to study music. It should not be seen as a waste of time, but in contrast, it is supposed to be a workable method to stimulate the students' curiosity and their willingness to deepen their knowledge in a specific topic. All of us know how young people are interested in music, but what they likely miss is a general tuition in the history of the music and a better knowledge about some of the most famous and important composers. An ever-increasing number of schools have already decided to give lectures where students can choose what fields of music to study. The experiment seems to work and students not only are getting high scores, but they also read up about the subjects they are more interested in. What is absolutely amazing is students often come up with new ideas regarding how to update their knowledge learnt at school. The study of music is supposed to sharpen our sensitivity and it should make our brain more prompt and able to catch the most apparently insignificant details of an issue. This is the main reason to fight the social phenomenon of brainwashing, something that is affecting students who are used to listening to some music that breaks their nervous system and their logical capabilities. However, this is not the only reason, I think music should be taught at school in order to widen the general culture of young people, and this is certainly something that can help to get more wise, sensitive and well-educated adults.

Nowadays, more and more people use electronic devices when they study. It helps them improve their learning ability and increase motivation. In my opinion, computers and tablets can replace books in schools and university. Firstly, children grow up with electronic devices, which become a natural element of their growing up. As a result, books for them are old-fashioned and boring. They want to have everything now. What's more, they hate reading. They would rather watch films on the internet than read books. Secondly, using computers or tablets helps to reduce the amount of books in children's bags. What's more, this situation helps them to protect the environment by avoiding deforestation. On the other hand, books help students develop their attention span. They have to focus on the topic for more than 5 minutes. Next, to find true information for homework it is better to use books, because on the internet students can find fake news. To sum up, in the near future all schools and universities will be able to use computers or tablets instead of books. It is more useful, more convenient, and more attractive for students.

The importance of zoos are focus on several talks when environment workers are together. For the people who support zoos in cities, these places have great importance for awakening human beings to their impact on nature, because only when you know about something you can protect it. When zoos attract people into that, a lot of activities can happen, whatever the age of the public. On the other hand, a lot of people think that animals must live free. In this conception, zoos are bad places for the animals, because there are very small cages there and they don't provide enough interaction with other species, as would happen in their natural habitats. However, I think the best way to make people become more aware of their role as a being belonging in nature is to provide fair conditions to the animmals live with freedom. For example, in South Africa, the savanna animals can live free and the human beings pay to visit them in their natural habitat. This practice is called "safari" and it has been seen as a positive way to improve the human awareness of the environment.

When I was a university student I was living with my parents. I don't think it was the better choice. My parents' house is located outside the city. Travelling from my parents' house to the university takes two hours. I remember I didn't usually study enough because I often felt tired. On the other hand, my husband was living alone in another city, he grew as a person, he became more independent, learned to manage his money and to solve problems, also he usually spent his time in extracurricular activities like baseball, gym or parties. I never had time for extracurricular activities because I lost 4 hours per day travelling in a bus. Also, my mother didn't allow me to play or to have a party with my friends. That was boring and sad. I remember that most of my partners were living alone because their parents' houses were so far. They usually spent the time studying in the library. They had the weekend parties as well. I usually spent my weekend studying because I didn't have enough time to do my homework.

My favorite film is "Shingeki no Kyojin," Attack on Titan. Its original comic is a bestseller because its development is very rapid, and because as the story goes on, its foreshadowing comes together elegantly. Nevertheless, the movie is good for nothing. If you know the original, you will realize that no matter how meticulously an original story is written, an animated version can spoil it to the extent that it makes you laugh. You are a comic artist, so this movie will give you a lesson that even if someone offers you an animation of your work, you had better consider whether or not it is a good offer.

TV, as one of the advanced technologies, impacts our lives in several ways. The most frequent use of this technology is for leisure since the various channels provide us with different sorts of films, cartoons, animation, and news. Furthermore, some educational channels are broadcasting different courses with various aspects. Nowadays, as people have got used to TV more than in the past, more channels with such content are becoming more popular and attracting more attention. For example, some sports channels give stretching exercises to people every morning. In addition, many programs provide basic training on various topics, such as cooking, gardening, motherhood, psychology, self-improvement, and more. In my opinion, this kind of content is both entertaining and educational. Moreover, there are some special programmes that only focus on educational content. For example, there is a channel that teaches children math, chemistry, etc. every night. In conclusion, while TV has plenty of programmes to entertain people, it also has a huge potential to be an important educational station, especially during this quarantine time because of Coronavirus.

Two years ago, I was on my best holiday ever. I went to the Maldives with my boyfriend. Actually, that holiday was a surprise for me. First, I had no idea where we were going.

That was the most magnificent place I have ever seen. The time there was very intensive. We did a lot of wonderful things. That was the first time when I saw real dolphins. What's more, we had an opportunity to swim with those animals. For sure it was an incredible experience. We also saw many beautiful views. Especially the sunsets were really amazing.

Hi Jack, How are you? Hope you are well. Last night I watched a movie that I am sure you will like so I decided to write you an email and recommend you watch "Lost" movie. This is a movie about some people whose airplane has crashed on an island and they have stocked on that island with some mysterious black smoke. It is a science-fiction movie that was made by an expert director. What I like most about this masterpiece is the way that they create the roles and characters.

Some people believe that some university students stay with their friends or in a dormitory, but others live with their own family. There are valid arguments on both sides, which I will discuss now. Based on my knowledge, living with their own family is a better option which can more force on a subject (Major) without concern about food, cleaning and so on. Most of the day they have to force on the subject (Major) which can get more credits and high grades. However, the biggest downside is time management. When attending university, students are just adults (19 to 20s), at which age they come into their stand live lives and need to know how to control everything such as time management, socialization, flexible living with others etc. When they get married or set up a company, they do not know how to do time management. Besides that, living in a dormitory or renting a room and sharing with three to five friends live together is very popular in the university life this decade. Many people say that every day when you have to cook, study, wash clothes and so on, it is a good time to not only study a subject (Major) but also learn time management. On the other hand, it is very tough and hard to stand on your own and nobody will help you. So, in a nutshell, I believe that living on our own can be a better choice, sticking our neck out and giving us more potential to be successful person.

Education is an essential part of the life of everyone who normally starts their student life from three or four years old. During those years kids usually have the same teacher from kindergarten to primary school who teaches them the basic subjects and spends most of the day with them. Contrary to that, in high schools, preparatory schools, and colleges people have different teachers for each subject as a means to teach students to get used to learning no matter the teacher who is teaching. This process of teaching in high schools is good for students because they learn to learn independently from the person who teaches and they just focus on the subject and knowledge behind it . To me, having different teachers each year has more benefits than having one teacher for several years because students have the opportunity to experiment with different styles of teaching during their educative process. They can also develop abilities to do investigation projects due to the fact that each teacher will ask for homework or papers with specific points to be scored in order that each student should develop this homework with those specifications and investigate the best way to present their works with the correct topic and framework. That's why I consider it's better to have different teachers through the years instead of one teacher with the same style and the same way of working, something that many times becomes tedious for students.

Hi, First of all, Happy Birthday, Jack! Hope you have a wonderful year. By the way, in my country, most people spend their birthday with their family or friends. You have dinner with your family and friends, and they give a birthday gift to you and sing "Happy Birthday" to you, and you have a cake with candles. So, I think almost every event on your birthday is the same as the ones in your country. Tetsuo

Improving writing skills is affected by several important factors that completely depend on the methods with which writers are being trained. Some days ago, my dear teacher introduced me to a website called "Write and Improve."

Different teachers have different methods and styles to teach concepts, so because of these differences between teachers, some people think that it can be more useful for students to change their teacher every year and try different methods. But some others believe that it is not a reliable way to learn, because students will get used to their teacher's behavior and changing the teachers can cause irreparable harm. After considering all the main points about this issue, we should mention that both of these thoughts have some strengths and weaknesses, which we will deal with hereafter. In terms of the learning issues, we should consider the behavior of both teachers and students. On one hand, it can be helpful for some students to have different teachers because it will help them to have various perspectives about concepts and they end up with a better understanding. For example, when a student wants to learn verbs, a teacher may tell him/her some words that do not make sense to him/her, but another teacher may talk about this concept in a better way. On the other hand, some students are not adaptable and changing their teacher cannot be helpful because adapting to a new method and behavior will be hard for them, so they are not going to make great progress. In conclusion, many different elements play a role - depending on personality and age - in what people find the best way to learn concepts. Therefore, the main point is to try to find the best way without any prejudice.

I believe men do not possess the right to be unfit. It should be the duty of every single citizen to reach at least some level of physical fitness. As a society we have got to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the defence forces when a crisis comes. But you can't force anybody to be healthy. You can't demand hard work from lazy people. You can nurture them, but you do not control them. It is human mentality that stands against everything imposed on them. Here is the proper way to nurture people. They have to realise that the hard work and training may be unpleasant. But it is nothing in comparison with diabetes or a heart stroke. It is much easier to carry eighty kilograms instead of hundred and sixty or more. All you have got to do is simply do something. Anything. And what about the idea of activities at least three times a week? It is definitely more than nothing. But it is slack. You can and you should do something every single day. Every day is a new day and your body needs to get some healthy dopamine from exercise. This dopamine is much more important than that from junk food or alcohol. Dopamine released by working out is deserved and you can really enjoy it. The opposite option is this. Don't do anything. Just sit on your couch and wait. It won't take a long time and your culture will decay. Another culture will come and push you away. They will annihilate your lazy and fat population. Here is one beautiful saying: Hard times produce hard men. Hard men lead to good times. Good times produce soft men. And soft men lead to hard times. So stop eating your doughnut, throw away your milkshake and go after it.

Nowadays, a great number of people are obsessed with exercise, or they think that it is the most important thing to be fit and healthy, and although I think that it is necessary too, it is not as important as other things. Firstly, whether you ask a doctor or a nutritionist, everyone knows that sport is a dependable way to keep ourselves healthy, because it prevents us from coming down with illnesses, such as obesity or cardiac problems. It helps us to make faster recoveries and it strengthens us... So it is indispensable to do exercise at least 30 minutes every day However, a lot of people are wrong when they think that they only need to do that to be healthy, because there are other fundamental issues in our life that are necessary as well wholesome. For example, our social life, our mental health, the conditions and environment where we live.... A further point is that our diet is another super necessary matter, because if you do not eat healthily, exercise will not help you as much as it could. In conclusion, sport is an indispensable activity in our life, but there are other things that are important too and we should not underestimate them.

Health is an essential part of our life because it lets us maintain our lifestyle. Good health gives us the opportunity to develop different activities and projects in a physical and mental way. On the other hand, wealth is also important to maintain this way of living, which means that to maintain good health people need to invest in healthy food, exercise, and even have hobbies to preserve good health. That is why both aspects of life are important. Keeping healthy is not an easy challenge because of different aspects which are expensive nowadays. But, health is not only about money or buying material things, health is also about being kind, grateful, and charitable, among other things, which in simple words means to be a good human being. Without good health people can't maintain themselves to become wealthy. Besides, being wealthy is also important because it lets us keep a good life quality, helping other people to overcome each difficulty. To sum up, being healthy is a key element of being wealthy because both aspects are important for human beings to develop and enhance a good lifestyle.

Books and Technology In the world of today, more and more areas are taken over by technology. Now many schools and universities are thinking of replacing books with computers and tablets. Of course, using a tablet instead of a book has its advantages. Firstly, many students complain about that they have to carry so many heavy books. If they used their laptop with everything saved on there, they wouldn't have to carry loads of books with them. Secondly, the world wide web can sometimes give more information to people who are doing research, for example. There is a great variety of websites available. However, books have their advantages too. First, on the internet there are not only trustworthy pages. Sometimes incorrect information is published. Books are written by experts who have studied their field. Also, many people enjoy the feeling of reading a "real" book. They like to "touch" the pages. This gives them a positive feeling. To conclude, I believe that books cannot be totally replaced. They are still an important part in nearly everyone's lives. A tablet will never give you that typical book feeling, after all.

To maintain an excellent level of health three important factors should be considered, which are like the three essential edges of a triangle: sleep, food, and exercise. None of these three items can diminish the importance of the other factors' role and influence in gaining mental and physical health. An adequate diet is an essential key to having a healthy body and mind. Since our intake of food is the source of energy that our body has, following a balanced diet can affect our health in a serious way. Furthermore, if the body does not have enough time to recover, which can only be achieved with enough time of sleep, body health will be compromised. In this period of time, our body not only finds the time to release the tensions which we experienced during the day but also allows the body to perform its duty properly. On the other hand, the body needs regular movement to keep the percentage of body fat and energy balanced and this can only be achieved by exercising. Therefore, although exercise is important for our well-being, it is not enough on its own, and it should be accompanied by a proper diet and sleep.

I think learning to speak a foreign language is less important these days than in the past, except for English. Besides doing it out of interest, you don't need to speak any language except English. I have two reasons which support my opinion. Firstly, English has become a global language. As everyone in this world speaks English, it's enough once you master it . You don't need to learn any other language to communicate with people. Actually, when I went on a trip to Germany, where the mother tongue is German, there was English everywhere. Clerks speak English and English signs are everywhere. Secondly, technology has developed rapidly. As interpreting devices are on sale, we don't need to speak the same language to talk together. Actually, I used one sometimes and it was very useful. It didn't waste time, or wasn't stressful. I hope it is going to be more popular.

As language is one of the widely used communication tools in the world, learning English as an international language is very important. In this day and age, English is known as the first language in the world, and most of the academic and political communications in the world are conducted in this language. Therefore, it becomes a vital language in our lives. Since I am a graduate student and need to read English papers in my field and also should be able to write new papers about my subject, I need to master English. Secondly, I am trying to get admission to foreign universities for my PhD degree, and one of the first essential requirements is to pass an English academic test. Thirdly, with the rapid growth of this language everywhere, it could unlock career opportunities for me, especially if I want to work in an international company.

For many people music is a very important part of their life. It helps them to find the best solution for a problem or is the easiest way of entertainment. In my opinion, students should learn to play musical instruments. Firstly, playing on the instruments develops our brain. We are able to focus on the subject for a longer time than somebody who never tries to do it. What's more, students became more patient and hard-working, because if they want to be a master they must practise many hours a day. Secondly, studying music develops general knowledge. They learn about famous composers and conductors. Furthermore, people who learn to play a musical instrument became more sensitive. They know how to find a balance between relaxing and work. On the other hand, playing on the musical instrument steals a lot of free time. Students who want to be the best need to practise for a long time. The don't have enough spare time to develop their relationship with friends. As a result they are shy and lonely. To sum up, studying music is a very important part of education. It opens our view of the world and other people.

We are living in age of communication which means we need to communicate with people in different languages and cultures. As we all know, English is the most international language that many people in the world are able to speak, therefore we need to know it as well as we can. Nowadays, many resources are prepared for those that want to learn English and all of these resources have a lot of things which learners can use. There are some books, podcasts, social media pages, websites,etc, but one of the most effective of these resources, which I found so useful, is a website that helps the learners with their writings, "Write&Improve" This website has some helpful features which help all the users at different levels.

A lot of things change every day in life sestem, travel is one of them. In the past, travel was through animals, like horses and camels. These days we have trains, planes, and cars to travel faster than before. In the future, I think there will be some things faster than now, maybe some quick robots which could arrive in the same moments, and these robots can check passengers' passports and be a captain of a plane. But others are against me, they say everything is going to be the same, there will be no more innovations other than airplanes, subways and undergrounds. It is impossible to invent transportation that is faster than them. It would affect people and cause millions of accidents. Therefore, I believe if I could invent some faster transportation I would show it to people and help them to travel rocketly. But until then we do not have any new things.

Many countries in the world are still in lockdown amid COVID-19 fears. Some countries have eased restrictions, however, travel habits are shifting to new norms. The transportation to go abroad remains the same: aircraft. A visa will be also required as usual. The most different procedure in the future will be proof of the absence of the virus. Every country will start demanding proof that "I haven't contracted COVID-19" at immigration at the airport, otherwise the previous fear could come again. If you used to take part in a tour group whenever you travelled abroad, the kind of tour group will change to a small group, such as less than 10 people. This small tour group will raise the total travel cost due to there being less discount. It will cause fewer people to join trips, therefore, every travel industry is faced with the need to find new incentives. " Man is a thinking reed," said Pascal. Now is the time to become a thinking reed!

I think computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. I have four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, it is cheaper with a long-term view. Once we get a device, it doesn't cost more money to add new literature than a paper book. Secondly, it stays in a tidy condition, as it is new. Books are deteriorating, but devices don't get old. We don't need to re-buy them. We may spend more initially, but not for an initial money, but not for a running money. Thirdly, it doesn't need space because it's portable. We waste lots of space with stacked books. They are useless and dangerous. We can use this space for something else with a device. Lastly, it's easier to look up literature. Wherever you are and whenever, you can do that. It's very useful On the other hand, I think it is better to read novels with paper books. It is one of my precious moments to go around bookshelves to find an attractive book. If you have decided which book you want to read, devices are better, but if not, paper is valuable.

A good understanding of math is essential for a lot of areas in chemistry. I also want to improve my English capabilities because I intend to go abroad and to visit Oxford University for a summer term in two or three years. Also, to be almost fluent in English is not solely good for studying but is in general a wanted skill. So, to improve my math, I plan to attend special lessons, where teachers will repeat all the necessary stuff. To improve my English, I have started reading English fiction, reading the BBC news on a daily basis, and watching a lot of English television.

Most medical doctors prefer to work in cities than in poor and rural areas. They have more opportunities to make money in big hospitals. On the other hand, in poor and rural cities, there aren´t advanced medical tests, drugs and machines. Most doctors are interested in learning how to use and apply the modern treatment and medical devices. I think they prefer to work in big cities not only for the money. The poorest people face many challenges to have access to health care. The main problem is that there aren't enough specialized doctors who work in poor and rural areas. Most countries send the younger doctors to work in poor and rural areas. If they have a patient who needs specialized attention, they send the patient to the city's hospital. It is difficult for the patient to be far away from their home but it is necessary. I think it is the only one way to solve this problem. The government has intervened in poor and rural areas for many years. To grant health services, the government has developed projects that send drugs, medical doctors, nurses and medical devices. The government intervention is necessary because the private sector would never invest in those areas.

It has been suggested that some people like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old and others prefer a shorter life but much more intense. I personally do entirely choose a calm life until 100 years old, and I will explain why in this essay. Firstly, in a long and calm life we have to consider how to earn money because money is just like water for humankind. The person who does not have much will be in trouble. However, nowadays, everyone has to do a job until retirement due to everything are insisting especially household goods such as a job until retirement due to everything are insisting especially household goods such as flagship performance phone, laptop and other gadgets. If he gets married, his life will be perfect because two individual people could earn money. When they get children they might encourage and know how sweet life is. Furthermore, when they get older, they are not concerned about fortunes due to their life insurance and elderly care is obviously coming to support them even though their children have not looked back. I do appreciate that some people think differently, saying that is better to live a short life and more intensely. It is more a way to have succeeded degrees and earned money. If he does shopping, he does not need to consider his pocket. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the person is thoroughly famous and successful but that person will die in their 30s, the fortunes are undoubtedly going to be nationalization. The life is so meaningless and they do not know how real life is. So, in a nutshell, I do prefer to live a long, calm life until 100 years old, which is more meaningful, and get opportunities to taste life.

Some people think that all paper books can be replaced by electronic books. Is it possible? Nowadays, technology is incredibly developed, so young people who are familiar with technology understand easily how to use it. Furthermore, technological books are easy to bring anywhere and anytime because if you bring only one computer or one tablet, you can read all books. And also they are not heavy. Moreover, technological books are good for the environment because it is not needed to cut down trees. On the other hand, technological books have some disadvantages. They need electric energy. If they don't have any charge, we can't read any books. We need to worry about charging them or finding possible charging stations. In addition, it will happen that we have them stolen at school or in a break frequently. If it happens, we can't study any more. And also technological books are bad for our eyes if we use them for a long time. Technological books have a lot of advantages. However, I think it is difficult to change paper books for technological ones.

For me, my best holiday ever was in August 2019 when I went to the south with my girlfriend. It was a road trip of two weeks and I have a lot of good memories of this. The first stage of our road trip was Toulouse. We visited the "Space City" and we saw a lot of rockets; it was very impressive! After this, we went to meet some friends in the town and went to a restaurant. The second stage of our road trip was Carcassonne, a medieval city near Toulouse. We visited the castle by night, it was very beautiful. The last stage of our trip was Le Verdon, a beautiful city known for its river and its mountains. We visited the area and saw a beautiful panorama. We did some activities like the "Via Ferrata." To be precise, we were hiking through the mountains. For all these reasons, it was my best holiday ever.

Technology nowadays is an essential part of everyone's life, which is the reason why education has adapted many technological devices to teach and to replace physical resources, such as books or papers. People today use technology every single hour in their life, keeping them always connected. In education, computers and tablets are good devices to use in interactive classes, but books definitively keep being the principal information source. Of course, many books are online these days making work, homework, and projects easier. However, we should keep physical and technological resources working together to get good projects and the teaching and learning process should be developed in an efficient way. Instead of replacing books or using only technological devices, teachers and students should use both in order to get a balance between the old and the new, getting tested information as well. Personally, I use both resources for my university homework or projects which I am developing; books, computers, and tablets being a great support to me.

People in distant villages and the countryside still are barred from significant health service care. On one hand, doctors who had studied for a long time in search of a walfare, may avoid living in such sectors and on the other hand, it seems the governments do not have an effective plan to deal with such problems. Lack of facilities and also medical materials in the countryside might cause the occurrence of a wide variety of illnesses, therefore people who have lived in these areas, who are not a few, need to have more access to doctors, but actually doctors do not want to spend their life away from their families and friends, and also without their hobbies and modern life. Given the issues we mentioned on the top, only the law is able to help us to solve this kind of problem. If governments are forced to provide an appropriate welfare plan for doctors that are willing to visit patients in these areas, and consider some rewards for them such as tax freedom, these may encourage doctors to move to the countryside, at least for some days a week.

In our contemporary society, many people are willing to be rich rather than be healthy. To be rich can be good for your environment, however, rich does not invariably mean that your are healthy. There are many research studies that imply that it is better to be healthy than to be rich. This essay discusses why being healthy is more important than being rich. Firstly, many research studies show that the people who are rich value their lives less than those who are not rich. Less confidence causes many health problems. For example, rich people who are less satisfied with their lives consume proportionately more alcohol and they do less activities and sports to stay fit. There are many diseases that occur more in rich people than less affluent people, for example, heart attacks and obesity. Secondly, health is more important than wealth, because if you do not feel physically fit but you have money, it will be very difficult to do every activity that you like. If you are not able to do things that you like because of health problems, it can cause mental problems. For example, you will appreciate the value of your life less and you will be able to do activities that can weaken both your mental and physical health. Another point that makes being healthy more important than being rich is if you are healthy you are be able to become rich. The other way around is in most cases not possible or easy. There are many diseases that you cannot eradicate from your body, you have to find ways to manage the effect of those diseases in your life and this can only be if you conduct activities which are good your health. To summarize, to be healthy is very important. If you are healthy you can do many activities which can make your life better and richer. The converse is in many cases not possible.

I have studied on the website Write and Improve for a long time, probably for two years. As it happens, I found this website when I talked with a friend. She recommended a website that was helpful to improve writing skills and I tried it. This website is really useful and it has a lot of interesting functions for me to improve my writing skills. Firstly, Write and Improve has different levels, from Beginner to Advanced, or additionally there is Business and Just For Fun. So you can easily choose the level that is suitable for you. For me, when I had just started practising on this website, I chose the beginner level to become familiar with writing, then I tried a higher level, intermediate, and now it is advanced. Secondly, it has a lot of varied topic and fields, so you have many options. You can choose any theme you like. I'm an introvert person so I usually choose a topic that is relevant to society and some topic argument about issues in life. The theme I liked best was a debate about becoming a volunteer in school or not. Thirdly, it also has a good system to check your mistakes in your essay, point out the mistakes you made and the way to fix them. It is very convenient and useful, right? Fourthly, it has a progress board to let you know your progress. Fifthly, it also has a timer regime for you to check your ability at writing. Finally, the screen of the website is completely in English so it will help you to improve that language you are learning. My advice is you should try to use this Write and Improve website.

This is an idea supposed to work because it will strengthen young people's helping aptitude. I must admit I did not completely agree with this proposal but after having seen the achievements in British schools, l changed my opinion and l am trustful that good results can also be got in Italy. The project was initially managed by Rome-based schools that are going to give some lectures with distance learning for students who live not only in other Italian cities, but also abroad. In other words, students can decide to follow instructions from the net in order to plan their volunteer activities around their neighbourhood and get a score for all the satisfactory results. The score, over the next weeks will be computed for the final score of the degree. This kind of activity should be always promoted because many areas of our society need consistent help to overcome their problems, but what is most important, schools should be funded by local and national governments. There is already a large number of students who have tried this kind of experience, this is because they are simply invited to brush up on the notes they made. New interested students wise, what they are called to do is to read up about volunteer activities and how to deal with people in disadvantaged social and economic conditions. Contrary to popular belief, a volunteer experience is something that enriches young people and adults. In order to make the volunteer experiences as satisfactory as possible, we need to make a precise timetable where all the activities are carefully planned. For example, letting students go to migrant assistance centers where they are likely to have the opportunity to practise their foreign language skills.

In my opinion, move alone is a hard way to become independent. Moreover, when you are in your first years of college, you need some help to overcome the stress. For instance, the homework could be difficult and if you panic about that, there is nobody to tell you, "everything is all right or "you are the best at something like that." Furthermore, if you feel bad owing to some strange food, nobody can help you either. In fact, you can have a roommate, this is more fun than being alone and you pay for just half of the bills. Also if you know you will have a roommate you can choose a bigger apartment. In addition, if you're busy and your roommate is not, she or he can cook the dinner. However, staying at home with your family is a good choice too. For example, you don't have to clean an apartment or cook, you just have to focus on your studying. Besides, your parents support you and help you with your homework if that's not too difficult for them, so long as you have a desk where it's calm and you have your own room. Sometimes, you don't have the money for an apartment which is next to the college. Moreover an apartment can be really expensive and if you have some project to get married or buy a house, you need to keep your money. Lastly, I think the best is having a roommate but if you are ready to live alone and you have the money, go for it! On the contrary, if you are not ready at all, stay with your parents and don't worry. You can change next year and take an apartment. Just enjoy your college years !

Most medical doctors prefer to work in cities rather than in the countryside. There are a few reasons for such a situation. Firstly, career development is more possible for people who work in cities. Secondly, hospitals located in cities are far better equipped than those in rural ares, which gives medics opportunity to fully use their aptitudes and abilities. Lastly, being a doctor in a city is undoubtedly more beneficial than in the countryside. However, this generates the predicament of an insufficient number of medics in rural areas and under such circumstances lives of people living in those places are endangered. One obvious solution to this problem could be an increment of doctors' salaries, who work in those regions. That might be enough to convince some medics to change their workplace. Supplying hospitals with a larger number of ambulances and helicopters can be another idea. That theoretically can guarantee far greater accessibility to medical healthcare for people whose lives are at risk.

Hi Billal, I went on a trip to Los Angeles with my classmates last week. We ate around and went to some tourism spots. I enjoyed the trip so much and I was so excited before that because it was my first time setting foot in the United States, and also visiting Los Angeles was a very important event for me. Let me talk a little about my family history. There was my great-grandfather in Hiroshima, Japan in the early 20th century. He decided to migrate to Los Angeles. After that, he began to run his own businesses there, which were a Japanese inn and a grocery store selling soy sauces. He started a family, which means my grandfather was born in Los Angeles! A few years later, they came back to Hiroshima because of World War II. Tetsuo

One of my favorite movies, which inspires me a lot, is an Indian movie and its name is "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara." This film is directed by Ms. Zoya Akhtar, and she is the sister of one of the leading actors in the movie. This is a story of three childhood friends and they plan to wander around Spain and organize three activities which they want to do. They visit various places, meet many people, and explore the beauty of nature. The things I liked about the movie are the storytelling, direction, and smoothness. It shows the importance of friends, the elegance of nature, and the joy of travelling the world.

Today, zoos are an alternative to nature for everyone. This place allows you to learn, watch, and admire some of the beautiful creatures that belong in nature. Perhaps, zoos have a negative impact on animals. They are forced to leave their birthplace to be sent into these big cages. Many of us do not understand that this situation is not right for them, because you don't let them live their real life in the wild. People are so amazed by zoos that sometimes they forget what is hidden inside these structures. Animals are creatures that shouldn't be captured because this will ruin their normal life routine. For example, thinking that the lion, "The king of the savannah" is forced to live in a cage is very sad. It is unacceptable that the freedom of a free animal is taken away. But also other species, each of them with their own lifestyles, are moved to zoos due to hunting. They are put to sleep and then once they are awake, they see a different world. A world where they cannot hunt their prey or where the prey cannot escape from their hunters. Zoos are so uncomfortable. However, there are natural reserves, they are like zoos but without cages. Animals are free to walk in their territory, hunt, and live like they were in the wild. No one gets hurt but they get protected.

Many people consider truthfulness as a very positive virtue. I also believe that, yet I dare to say that under some specific circumstances it is better to tell a lie. Firstly we need to determine why we lie. By doing so we can hide inconvenient facts about ourselves or we also can avoid being punished for things that we have done. For short amount of time lying might even be beneficial for us, however when the truth is revealed we often get in a much bigger predicament than we would have if we had not lied. Another consequence of lying is that people could start perceiving us as a dishonest and unreliable person. This obviously worsens our relationships with friends or acquaintances. The last downside of not telling the truth is the fact that lies are considered as sins by our society. I see only one exception in which we are justified to tell a lie. I believe that we should not tell the truth if that only hurts other people . I can give an example of such a lie from literature. There is a book called "Kamizelka" written by Bolesław Prus. The novel depicts the story of one young couple. Sadly, the husband is terminally ill and he loses weight uncontrollably. His wife decides then to shorten his vest's bands in order to give him hope. To summarise, I think there are conditions under which we can lie, but normally I strongly believe that it is better to just tell the truth.

Volunteer work for high schools students would not, in my honest opinion, bring positive results and it even might have a negative impact on them. The main purpose of school is to teach students various subjects and prepare them for their final exams. I believe that this is a period of time in which we need to really focus on our education. From my personal experience I can tell that there are pupils who actually learn a lot on their own and who take part in many competitions, which consumes most of their free time. I am completely convinced that if volunteer work was required from them, they would become distracted and extremely tired so that they might not achieve as much as they wanted. The second drawback of the volunteer work is the fact that it might be perceived as some kind of a duty or an errand. If something is compulsory, we usually tend not to like such a thing. I think people who willingly participate in this kind of work can gain experience or help others. However, if someone is not eager for such thing, then it will be only a burden for them. Additional work might also collide with extra-curricula activities of some students. In such a situation they would need to resign from their interests. Some people as well consider work just as a way of earning money, therefore they have even more reasons to dislike the idea of volunteer work. To summarise, volunteer work can be beneficial for some people, but making it obligatory for everyone is pointless.

In order to develop any task, humans need to gather a wide range of skills which are adopted during our lifetime, therefore, practise is completely required when it comes to acquiring abilities. It is known that the more skills that we have, the more tools to solve a problem or hard situation are available. On the one hand, my career is highly related to human beings. As far as I am concerned, no matter how physically fit or strong we are, every activity we do is absolutely related to our core "computer," which is our unbelievably clever brain. What is more, childhood and the beginning of the teen age are the most essential moments for its proper development. In addition to taking care of it by protecting it from strong hits and having an adequate diet and the right amount of sleep, there is a pattern which is crucial. It is called "mind sharp," which basically means, brain training. When the first studies in this field appeared, almost every school took wonderful policies with the aim of encouraging children to take up habits which put their minds in motion. Commonly, most primary schools introduced music into their basic studies, nevertheless, some high quality learning colleges have taken up stunning activities such as theatre, philosophy, farming and so on. Believe it or not, the world of education is witnessing a revolution in the way that children are taught. Contrary to the ancient beliefs of learning everything by heart, the new systems give extreme priority to team work, leadership, entrepreneurship and critical thinking among many other skills marvellously useful for the adult lives of the future generations. To sum up, the government has endorsed these practises by raising the educational budgets, looking forward to seeing the first changes in society within the next fifteen years.

After high-school graduation, students have to make choices about their studies. They need to decide what and where they want to study. In the process other choices have to be made, such as should I stay living at home while I am studying, or should I move away and live on my own? For some, the choice is simple as their university is not close to their homes so they have to take their own apartment. Others have to decide whether or not they will move out from their parents'. When students can decide, there are a few interogations that need to be taken into account. First, how will you pay your rent? There are two options. Your parents will fund you, or you will have to take a part-time job to fund it. In the second scenario, students need to be aware that they will have less free time, and less time for their homework. Secondly, will I feel comfortable living on my own? Indeed, some young students wouldn't feel able to live on their own, and still need the support of their parents. And last but not least, will it be beneficial for my studies ? It is important to know if living on my own will be a true benefit or, contrarily, if it will bring difficulties. In my opinion, moving away to study can be a great opportunity, and young students will become more independent living on their own if they can manage it. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware that it won't suit all students, and everyone is different. I do not have a yes or no answer to this question.

Research recently has shown that playing musical instruments can be considered an effective phenomenon for people to feel more peaceful and improve their mental health. As a way to encourage people to play instruments, some schools start teaching music to students because in this case children get an early start in music and they will be able to show their best potential in music but some schools may avoid doing that, which may be caused by economic circumstances. According to scientists' research, music can help people to concentrate much more. When a musician starts playing a piece, different organs get involved in this activity because it asks for more compatibility. Doing such a thing can help us to enhance our brain working. Although preparing proper classes and adequate musical instruments may cause high expense for schools, the outcomes that playing instruments give back are more influential than this spending. So, if the governments start encouraging schools to change their curriculum and incorporate some music courses for students, it can be like an insurance for students' mental health.

My reasons for learning English I have studied English since I was at kindergarten. Twice a week there was a class in which a teacher taught us animals and colours. However, I do not know if I remember these from then. When I started school, my parents wanted me to learn English even though I did not like it. They used to say that it would help me later, but with what? They did not say. Later on, I started to like English classes because of a teacher who made them seem fun. Only then I thought about why I should learn English. First of all, since I was a little child I have wanted to travel the world, so I realised that if it ever happened, I should be ready to communicate with local people. But how could I do it if I did not know any worldwide language? That is the main reason why I decided to learn English. Another reason for learning English is the perspective of a well-paid job. Nowadays, almost every employer ask you to know at least one foreign language. So it doesn't matter if you are very good at doing something if you don't know one more language besides your mother tongue. Moreover, I would love to have the chance to study abroad and that's why I must learn English. All in all, one can never know what life brings so it is better to be prepared for any opportunity one might receive.

Is speaking a foreign language still important nowadays? I believe it's more important than ever. In the past, speaking a foreign language was important, especially to get a good job. However, today with globalization, all countries have become more connected. More connection between countries means that speaking another language is relevant for work, for study, or for friendship. I will explore the reasons in the essay below. First of all, in the past, speaking a foreign language was related to work. Usually people who spoke another language worked in big companies overseas. Nowadays, even in small companies a second language is required. For example, I worked in a small company in Brazil and it was necessary to speak and write in English. That is because the company had customers in the USA and Australia. Second, today with the internet, it has become easier to have contact with people around the world. To talk to a foreigner you have to speak his language. In conclusion, it's important to speak a foreign language these days; more so than in the past.

In terms of school improvements, many different things will happen there, such as with materials , the study methods, and the school . In the future, plenty of study strategies will change. Technology will be in the whole teaching process, for instance, they will use a smart board rather than a blackboard and smart laptops for scientific materials. Also, there will be all sorts of new classes about art and theater, as well as about social science and the environment. In the school building for example diverse activities like the playground, furthermore, with swimming, sports and hiking. School activities will include a marathon in mathematics or science experiments and a heptathlon in computer sciences. I am sure the future version of school will be different from the previous one and it will be useful for the next generations. Perhaps for teachers, procedures will be easier than before.

I believe cultural exchange is one of the most important things we can do in life. I do not see any disadvantage if you can afford it. Maybe the only disadvantage is related to the money you should spend. Studying in another country could be expensive, especially if you do it at a great university or high school. Apart from that, I see the exchange as an opportunity. Staying in touch with new cultures allows the student to grow as a person. Learning new languages could be one of the most important skills you could acquire. At the end of the process you should be able to speak another language fluently. The networking effect is an advantage of the experience too. Knowing different people in different countries could be a great opportunity to increase your career. As I mentioned in the beginning, in my view almost all are advantages if you finally decide to study abroad.

Nowadays, studying abroad is becoming popular among students from different levels and these kinds of opportunities have pros and cons to consider. In my opinion, I agree with the idea of studying abroad because there are more pros than cons. Some of the most important pros of studying abroad are: more options to study, international students have the opportunity to progress in their studies, and more job opportunities with enhanced CVs. Students can also make more friends, become more independent and learn new languages and cultures. That is why study trips or scholarships abroad are good chances for students. On the other hand, students also have to deal with difficulties during their time abroad. Some of those problems are scholar places, budget, culture shock, not being fluent in a language, and some students even have issues to return to their country and their studies there. To sum up, studying abroad is a wonderful experience for each person, but, people should also consider some things before they decide to go on this kind of study adventure.

My favourite season of the year By: Carla Parr I like both seasons in my country, but, if I have to choose one, winter season will definitely be the chosen one. To me, winter season is the best season ever because during this season I can snuggle up with a mug of hot chocolate and watch movies. I can also share making smores with friends on a camping trip. In general, I can do different activities with people that I love. Some advantages of the winter season are holidays. During winter season Christmas and New Year's Eve come. These holidays give us a great opportunity to share things with family and friends, spending time together or doing fun activities such as 'the invisible friend', special dinners, or small trips near to my town. In conclusion, winter is my favourite season ever because it is the perfect opportunity to share and create special moments with relatives and people who I am not able to see frequently, but I love. These are some of the reasons why I like winter.

Exercise is obviously important for our health. If you don't do exercise at all, your muscles would be vulnerable. This makes it easy to get wounded and causes bad metabolism and a loss of vitality. However, is exercise the only way to keep healthy? What do you think about people with disabilities? They can keep healthy somehow, though they can't do exercise easily. Don't you think there are things that are more important? Exercise is physically good, but how about mentally? Are you satisfied with exercise only? The answer is "not exactly." I'm sure when you eat whatever you want or whenever you are hungry, your stomach is satisfied. When you get round to reading your favorite book, I believe that your sentiment is satisfied. This means that your body is satisfied with it, and you are meant to be healthy in this moment. Moreover, loving yourself or other people is also important mentally and emotionally to keep healthy. Consumption such as going shopping or going out may be occasionally important to relax. I think health has many aspects and a variety of things are important activities.

Dear Sir, I heard you are considering banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I have to say this is a bad idea, and may cause a strike in our lovely town. Why? Due to its convenience and multiple functions, people depend on the phone to get information, communicate with others, surf on the internet, and so on. Although people may be deeply adhered to their phone, even addicted, while sometimes checking the mobile unconsciously, it seems dangerous, depending on how the user uses this tool. In fact, the tool is innocent. In addition, the mobile phone is created to improve the efficiency of communication, when sometimes need to talk or confirm with someone. For instance, you went to the shop but suddenly forgot what your family requested you to purchase. It's easy to check the list immediately. Therefore, forbidding the use of the mobile phone is definitely backset to the anterior time. I believe this is unwise and it's not worth the council making the law. Furthermore, it's breaking the constitution which claims to guard the people's rights, such as freedom and secret talking. The council should stand with people to protect their natural right from the constitution, instead of depriving them. against the superior law and neglect the opinion of the public. To boil down to ban the use of mobile phone is not only against our personal will but also breaks the institution in our country. I sincerely recommend you to retract this proposal.

Living away on your own during school is a good way to get to know new possibilities and overcome challenges. Some students would prefer to live at home with their family while they are at school. That is because they can save money and it is more comfortable having your parents around to support you. However, I can say from my own experience that living away is the best option, if you are open to new challenges. I will explore this below. I went to a university far from my hometown. Firstly, I took a bus in Vinhedo to go to Sao Paulo where my university is located. I watched the classes and then I took the bus back to Vinhedo. In the first month I lived with mom and having her support was good. Nevertheless, I spend around three hours in a bus and I was getting tired. After a few months, I decided to move to Sao Paulo to live on my own. That was the best decision I ever made! I saved time, I learned how to cook, how to take care of my house. And this was a lesson that I took for the rest of my life. In conclusion, despite all the facilities of living with our parents, living on your own is an amazing experience which can bring you personal development. You can develop new skills like cooking.

In my opinion, volunteering could help you to become a better person with interesting abilities. You should be a communicative person, with high aspirations and a different talent: to help people. I believe that a student is a child who dreams of becoming an adult. This difficult process is easier when humanity become help. Certainly, volunteer work must be a challenge for every man who practises it, but when you realise the opportunities, you are the happiest. " The more the better" said a famous proverb. So, your happiness depends on difficult and hard work. The more people you help, the happier you are. All the world looks for help and other people who give love every second. When I was a student, I participated in BOS, a business organization for students. This is very interesting volunteer work. It helped me so much to be a better person with better abilities in economics and communication. I was in this program for one year and I think that I was a lucky person to be there. I love this organization with all its great people. I believe it is so important to practise different programs and a variety of things which could help you to become a complete human. All humans in the world could be better if they progress every day. I think that this is the key to success.

I think the most effective layout in the office depends on what kind of job the workers do. If you have to concentrate on the work in a silent space such as coding, data mining, and editing, then you require a space which is enclosed with cubicles. No one disturbing you drives your work faster than ever. Meanwhile, if your job is to create something new, such as a journalist, designer and advertiser, then you require the space which has no walls separating employees from their co - workers in order to cooperate, discuss, and abrupt congress. Besides, you may consider the communication ability of co-workers. When many of those are hilarious and good conversation is carried on, the open space could be better for them regardless of their job type. The most important point is how much co-workers feel comfortable in the office. Moreover, the quality of business should be kept at a high level.

Dear Aki, How have you been? It has been a long time since I sent you an e-mail before. I'm very happy to tell you about my recent event. I went to a concert. Do you know what kind of concert it was? Unbelievable! It was the legendary music group, Tigers. Can you believe it? You and I used to listen to their songs and go to their concert very often. But they broke up when they were at the peak of their popularity. Happily, they reunited recently. When I heard the news of their reunion, I was eager to go to their concert. Anyway, I have to apologize for not letting you know about it. I'd like to go to their next concert with you. By the way, their concert was amazing. I felt that they were still young. Their performance made me excited and happy. When I heard their first song, I felt like bursting into tears. They often screamed in the concert like young people. Fans including me also responded with screaming. It was like a dream. Let's go to the next concert together. See you soon. Sincerely yours, Kazu

Opinions widely diverge about studying abroad. Some believe that it may have positive points for students to live overseas and others explain the reasons which might prove it is not helpful for young people. In this essay, we are going to interefere different aspects of this issue. Studying in a foreign country might help young people to become familiar with a new culture, habits, traditions, lifestyle, etc., which can help young adults to find a different perspective on life. These students get a chance to be independent and create their own way to live, but on the other hand, they may also find it difficult to live in a new country because of some issues that they have to deal with. The biggest problem is with learning, understanding, and speaking a new language. For example, studying abroad for a student who does not know the language of the host country may turn into a terrible experience. He really faces many problems in high school or university and it might deliver a serious blow to him. Due to these facts, when we start to evaluate the issue, we discover the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages and it depends on students' knowledge of the host country. Today, studying abroad is regarded as a new opportunity to raise the level of education, which helps people with cultural transmission.

My experience with Write and Improve. Write and Improve is a website where you can improve your writing through exercises. These exercises will be checked for you and it is shown where there is room for improvement. A simple concept really, but it has proven to be very successful for me; ever since I've started using Write and Improve I've improved my writing a lot, without a great deal of effort. I only wished it was a bit more organized; at first glance the website is a mess, but this is a small price to pay when using Write and Improve. You can see your progress on a graph on the right; this is a great feature. Sadly however, you can't scroll to previous results that don't fit in the graph, which comes as a rather significant annoyance. In spite of these flaws, the website is a real life-saver. I'd recommend it to anyone hoping to improve their English.

There is no doubt, these days many children are addicted to video games. The question is, do video games have a good effect on children or a bad effect? In this essay, I will discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of a positive side, video games could teach kids some skills. The main reason given to support this idea is that it can help them learn another language while playing by speaking with other players from other countries. To illustrate that, a lot of teenagers around the world enter these games online and speak with others. In other words, they learn through fun. But others say video games have many disadvantages. Firstly, children waste their time by doing nothing useful, many hours for an enjoyable. Secondly, sometimes there are sexy people play or they show you while you playing. Also, maybe they hurt kids' eyes if they play for a long time. Therefore, some people say it is really important to prevent children from playing these games, but other are against them and say it improves their skills. For my part, I believe that video games have a lot more cons than pros. Because of that I feel avoiding them is the best choice.

It is widely known that, when it comes to rural spaces, the vast majority of doctors do not desire to develop their career in such places. The reasons why it all happens are going to be pointed out below. Despite the fact that living in the countryside could be seen as a dream come true for many people, it may not be the case for someone whose career ambitions are unlimited. The thing is, living in a rural area gives people sometimes the impression of being trapped in a small space. Besides, technology and progress do not normally arrive on time in these places. Another issue to take into consideration, is the fact that the economic resources of people who live in rural areas are far less substantial than the ones of those who live in big cities. Nevertheless, the importance of an equal and balanced medical system is beyond doubt. Once said that, the primary focus of any kind of government should be based on developing medical and care systems in the harmest areas, by investing more money in them and turning those places into more attractive ones. Last but by no means least, improvements in rural facilities, in general, should be something to take stock of. Rural life is a luxury that must be preserved.

Opinions widely diverge about the functions of TV in society; whether it just has a role as entertainment or it can also help governments to promote public awareness about different aspects of life. Today, TV is an integral part of our life, generally people spend 2 or 3 hours a day watching different programs. So it seems a powerful means to lead public thoughts to a certain point. So, if governments want to change specific habits and behavior of their society then TV can be beneficial. But sometimes there are downsides to consider. In some countries where governments have control of the media, they usually use this power to guide people to certain points which are not exactly helpful for people. For example, when a government wants to start a war the media can help it to provide the public opinion with the benefits of war, which assuredly are not true. In my opinion, due to the era that we live in, TV can play an important role in educating societies or not. It depends on what it wants to do.

Nowadays, many people want to live healthily. We have many opportunities to exercise. I realise that there are gyms or fitness clubs in almost every city. For sure, exercise is important for our health. However, there is another important thing. In my view, if we want to live healthily, we need to eat healthily. Some people forget that they need a balanced diet. Our diet should include vitamins, protein, and fibre. We need to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables, obviously. But it doesn't mean that we are allowed to eat only salads or carrots. We only need to harmonize our meals. As I wrote previously, our meals should be well-endowed with protein, fibre, and vitamins. I'm aware that some people can't cook. But, today we can go to a restaurant and there they will make an appropriate meal for us. All we need to do is to send off for it. These companies prepare our meals and even deliver it to every place we want to. It's a huge dumbing down, obviously. We have to remember that we can't eat chunky meals. When we exercise and eat healthily, we can say we live healthily.

In my opinion, the requirement of a volunteer work experience from students who want to graduate can provide them with a good experience. I think this will benefit students in several ways. Firstly, from the humanitarian point of view, the youngsters will learn how to help others and raise their spirit of cooperation without expecting payment. Secondly, the volunteer work experience can be a bright spot in the students' CV that can be an effective factor in being accepted in a college or university. Moreover, this type of work allows them be in contact with more people with different beliefs and will teach them to behave in different situations which I think is a very precious experience. On the other hand, students maybe see the volunteer work requirement before graduation as a burden on their shoulders, but they will appreciate it when they finish it. In conclusion, it may be unfair to expect a volunteer activity as a requirement for a student who should graduate soon, but this adventure will benefit them in their future lives and careers.

From a psychological point of view, working in a stimulating office may help employees feel more lively and have more satisfaction. Employees in such an office can communicate with others, talk, have fun and so on. On the other hand, having an cubicle or enclosed workstation provides more privacy for staff and improves their concentration. Due to this prelude, choosing each of these kinds of office has downsides to be considered. On the one hand, a more open design office may help coworkers be more eager to do their job, of course without privacy, and on the other hand, an enclosed workstation has privacy without feeling lively but indeed there are more options available for designing an office. Some offices that were made by expert architects always have a specific spot for co-workers that help them to be together and also such offices have separate rooms for employees which help them to have privacy and concentrate during doing their jobs. In conclusion, an appropriate office should be made based on human needs and it is the main point to be compatible with different feelings of staff.

It is a complicated issue because it is related to the way of thinking of each person. So, if children play video games every day all the time, they will have a problem with interacting, learning other things, or even communicating. Otherwise, if children do different activities, study, play with other children, and they have schedules for video games, it is positive for them and their families can be calm. Also, it is very important to look into the video games for children, due to the fact that they can cause unwanted behavior. For example, my parents allowed me to play video games, but they were always there with me. They played with me and guided me if it was necessary. I consider that was for me because it taught me to share, organize my time, and have mental agility. However, I know people who played video games and they are addicted to them. Currently, they do not study and society thinks that they are such losers.

In contemporary society, medical doctors have a tendency to work in urban areas, in lieu of rural areas, which leads to many problems. In this essay, the main contributors to this trend, in conjunction with some proposed solutions to tackle this issue, will be discussed. Most medical doctors choose to develop their career in the cities because they believe that it will provide them with a variety of opportunities to be more successful and earn more money for their life. In rural areas, local hospitals do not have enough medical equipment, good facilities, and so on to help doctors improve their professional skills. The reverse situation is true of urban areas, doctors not only get access to modern medical technology but also have special training, even studying abroad to broaden their horizons and have professional qualifications. Moreover, it is undeniable that the salary and rewards paid to medical doctors in the cities are usually higher than those in the countryside. Therefore, due to their standard of living, as well as the education and entertainment for their children, families are much better off when compared with living in the rural areas. However, the rise of this issue has caused some serious drawbacks that both local authorities and government should not ignore and they should co-operate together to address it. Most medical doctors leave for the cities because of chances and money, so local authorities and government should impose policies to raise salaries and have more professional training to attract highly qualified doctors. By upgrading facilities, local authorities and government can help doctors be more confident to treat victims and still work in the rural areas. Furthermore, the government should have a positive effect on the doctors' mind, which helps them realize that their mission is to rescue patients and heal their pain, irrespective of where they live. In conclusion, because of the salary and opportunities to develop, medical doctors decide to work in the urban areas. The aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for more policies and more encouragement to be introduced by authorities and government to interest qualified doctors in working in rural areas.

A revolution in learning writing The practice of writing was tough work for students living where few people speak English. I was surprised that Write and Improve could check my writing in seconds.

If one provides a writing program, the cost of it is not low, and it takes several days to check it, especially if the report is long.

My reasons for learning English. I am working very hard to enhance my English for many reasons. Firstly, I have to speak and write English fluently to continue my studies. After my current studies, I would like to do a master degree at university. One of the requirements that you have to meet to be admitted to this master is an English level of at least C1 in all language skills: reading, listening, writing, and speaking. Furthermore, I live in a country that has an open economy. In the Netherlands, you have many international companies and if you look at each job that is available they require a high level of English. In other words, you have to master English to find a good job. I am going to finish my current studies next year. Currently, I am working very hard to be able to master English in next year's summer holiday. If I do not succeed in reaching level C1 next year, I will take a gap year or a half-year gap . It depends on which university I will opt for. At some universities, you can begin a master degree in February; other universities only provide one at the onset of the school year

Dear Miss Trang, I am Nguyen Nguyen. Now, I am a student in the class 10A1. Today, I am writing this letter to ask you a little question. I am studying English but I really hope to study another subject. Probably the subject is economics or a different language like Korean, Japanese or Chinese because nowadays, our country is developing toward industrialization-modernization. In our country, almost there are many foreign companies from China, Japan, Korea and so on. So I think beside all of the subjects the students are studying now, we should have one more subject. I hope I can learn it soon as possible. Can you show me and give me your answer soon? Yours faithfully, Nguyen Nguyen.

The impact of exercise on healthy living is a common discussion topic in our times. The question is, are there more important things than one's physical condition? If the answer is yes, what kind of things? My answer is yes. I think that mental health is more important than one's physical condition, but both are linked. There are several aspects to cover if we want to maintain our mind in a good condition. Aspects like our family, the food we eat, our salary, the work-life balance and of course, our body. Exercise is not the only way to maintain our body healthy, we have to care for other things too. To conclude, I would like to mention again the importance of a proper balance. A healthy life is a combination of a trained body, a peaceful mind, a funny and interesting job, and a stable family life. If we work on all these dimensions we will enjoy a healthier life!

Nowadays more and more people choose to study English through self-study. This may be a real challenge, the experience being beyong compared to the classical form of learning, in a classroom with a teacher. The Writing part was never my strength as I often find it difficult to write a pure genuine text, but I can tell that since I have discovered the free writing tool offered by Cambrige, Write and Improve, my life radically changed! The thing about this educational website is that it is very handy, offering instant feedback on your writing. It suggests possible changes in order to get the best out of your work. Just think that you select your level in English and you are a click away from thousands of exam tasks. How handy is that? Undoubtedly, you are never alone. Or at least, you can choose not to be. If you sign up for a workbook, you are eligible for feedback from other participants and that is how learning becomes collective! Sharing is caring, isn't it? Write and Improve is more appealing and more interactive than any other learning platform, as it uses artificial intelligence in favour of education, which I think is a tremendous opportunity to challenge young learners to practise more and to get familiar with the exam tasks.

I have a negative impression of children playing video games. Children are addicted to the games and cannot manage their time. I often see the children who are playing games when they stay at school to study, when they have dinner with their family, and so on. They play games after midnight and they cannot get enough sleep, which may affect their health. They need to stare at the screen to play them, therefore their vision becomes worse. They play with their friends, not physically but in a virtual world , and they don't communicate together in the real world. I'm afraid that they can't get communication skills through play. Some video games are so attractive that children cannot stop playing them. They may continue to play them for a long time and suffer a harmful effect on their physical and mental health. If they manage their time and stop playing games after a short time, it doesn't do a tremendous damage, but it is difficult, especially for immature people. Adults have to manage their time and money besides looking after their children.

Dear editor, I would like to tell you and tell the magazine readers about my experience with the site Write & Improve. I am trying to use it every day, and it is helping me a lot to improve my English skills, especially my writing capacity. It has many different lessons, and in several levels. The challenge is not easy, for me it is difficult, learning English is hard, however the site is important because it makes the text correction quickly, and we can see the right writing. We review it, fix the text, as many times as necessary, so it corrects it again. For me using this site is very important, because I am a researcher, and many articles that I want to publish need to be in English, so I can achieve more readers. You must know how the scientific journals are rigorous with English writing, then I always need to ask an English reviewer before submitting an article to the journal, sometimes this is very expensive. So I need to be capable in the future. Finally, I guess that you readers can use this site in the same way. It is free, and it is always available for everybody.

My English teacher is my sister and she is a big fan of Cambridge, too. So, she recommended this website to me and I decided to try it, because I feel that my English writing level is not the same as my English reading and listening levels. Because of that, I need to work hard. My first text had as a prompt my opinion about zoos. As I'm a biologist, I got excited about doing that. So, I tried to use advanced words, like phrasal verbs, to reach a higher level. But, instead of, I realized that this website doesn't want to force anyone, it just wants to help and correct the main mistakes made by people. Weeks later, I was trying to make it a habit in my routine of learning English to write more on this website. Nowadays, once a week (every Thursday morning) I write here and send it to my teacher to tell me what I need to change to write better. I recommend this website, because it gives you the prompts for you to think about and write. Before I had difficulties to find an interesting prompt to write about, and now, I have a website that makes them for me!

In my opinion , television can entertain as well as educate. Meanwhile, everything has its specific pros and cons. A lot of scientific and educational channels are available for specific age groups, even for specific subjects for a particular class. Firstly , I would like to discuss some programmes and TV channels which provide study materials and classes, not only for remote areas but also for metropolises. So for those student who live in villages where skilled teachers are not available as much as needed, there are TV classes where they can learn through good teachers. There are many science and math classes with practice of question which give the feeling of a real class and they help to improve students like the students who are getting education in any public school in cities. In my opinion , most parents are not properly focussing their kids on language learning, or we can say that they are not so financially strong that they could arrange private classes for their offspring. Meanwhile, nowadays there are so many websites and television series to teach and strengthen different languages on television.

The point is "salary." Doctors working in cities earn a lot but those who work in rural areas earn a little. This problem is more intricate than we think. You may think that all doctors should have the same salary. However, the salary depends on the number of patients. The city doctors work much harder than dispensary doctors due to the number of patients. This means city doctors earn much more money than those who work in rural areas. Therefore, the point is not only "salary," but also "how busy their job is." No one can control the population, thus the solution is not easy. One of my suggestions is the implementation of "doctor helicopters." Huge hospitals are constructed near rural areas, substantial medical equipment is there, and adequate doctors are working there. Those hospitals possess some helicopters for emergency patients living in rural areas. It might be a huge cost to have helicopters, however the number of patients in collected rural areas will increase eventually. The salary would be pretty much the same.

The future of travel is very near. Today, our transport system is very evolved. We have made a giant step since its birth. Now we have so many types of transport, such as the bus, car, plane, and train. Each of them are still evolving. For example, we are introducing electric cars, which can allow us to pollute less than before. There are also other different types of inventions. One of these could be an increase in the speed of some vehicles, like trains or cars, too. Now we are thinking of another type of travel. Space travel. It will be awesome! Just think about how travelling in space can be! We will be able to see planets and stars from a very near distance, take a selfie in front of some planets, make video, etc... Maybe in late 2100 we could drive a flying car, like in futuristic movies. I hope to see this type of car in my future, because I really want to know how strange driving in the air is. This method can allow us to travel from country to country without taking a ship or plane. We could go from Europe to America driving our car. Awesome! I really hope for a future like this.

Hi John, Last week, I went to a music concert. The performing band was The Chainsmokers. I really love their songs because I grew up with them and they helped me when I was sad or angry. I decided to go to their concert. It was an awesome experience. I could see my favorite singer sing in front of me. I was so happy to be there. But the most beautiful thing is this...

My favourite film is "Big Fish." It is about the relationship between a son and his father, who is very sick. They never had a good relationship during their lives. That is because the father always told amazing and weird stories to his son. However, his son never believed him. When his father was lying in bed, very sick, he started to tell his son the same stories again. At the end, his father died and during his funeral, all of his friend from the stories show up. At the end, the son believed in his father. This is an emotional movie, a beautiful story about a father and a son. I believe you are going to love it! I know you have a great relationship with your father. I think you should invite him to watch with you.

It's an important statement. I already heard that many people spoil their health trying to be wealthier. And after some years they spend this money trying to rescue their health. It's interesting and true. Of course, we need to work, it is important for our society. But sometimes we lose our awareness of this and work a lot trying to have more and more. So family, friends, and our loved ones become less important than they should be considered. We need to be alert to this because there are many temptations, but we need to think if they are really important for our happiness. So, some months ago I decided to learn more about minimalism. If our needs are less, then we need to buy less and have less money. Less money means that we don't need to work so much time and lose our health. So I think I will learn how to balance my daily life.

I have to start with the fact that I have no experience with Write and Improve. What I am writing now is my first text. I came because I was searching on Internet websites for a place where I can improve my English . So accidentally, the first task is writing about a thing about which I have no idea. I need to write between 140 and 190 words and it is hard if you don't have any idea what you are writing about. I am halfway to finishing this text but still there are many words to enter. The teacher asked me to describe what I liked or didn't like. After the above one hundred words I can say this is a very good tool for improving the language level of anybody. I am going to come back here again for sure. That's all.

In my opinion, for our health there are two things that are the most important. First, like my teacher said, is exercise. I think all people should exercise at least once a week. It could be whatever you want. Running, bicycling, fitness training, combat sports, and stuff like that. It could also be, at least, a long walk with family or friends. Something which raises your heart rate and will make you sweat. The second thing which is probably more important than exercise is diet. Nowadays, people live fast, under high stress, and they do not have time to prepare good and healthy meals. They grab anything on the way to work without wondering about their health. The diets of the majority of people are unhealthy, without fruits, vegetables, vitamins, good carbs, fats, and proteins. People eat irregularly, very often late at night and after that they have problems with overweight, diseases, and self-acceptance. I think the problem with people's diets is one of the biggest ones in today's community.

I have watched TV since I was a child. The reason why I watch TV is that it is enjoyable and useful for killing time. But, one day I noticed that watching TV was nothing but wasting time. When I watch TV programs, I just spend meaningless time without thinking about something. I am a human being, so I have to think about something even if it's once a day. Then, I had to change my mind about watching TV. Of course, TV gives me a lot of pleasure by relaxing me, making me smile, and encouraging me. Furthermore, educational programs like the ones about English, history, and politics give me lots of useful knowledge. They are really useful for my life. I can say that they are my teachers in my life. In conclusion, I should get well along with TV. When I need to watch it, I should concentrate on the program as my studying or my pastime. When I don't need to do it, I should study at my desk.

I think it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. If we go to zoos, we can observe the lives of many species of animals directly. It's an amazing experience for young children and it may make them to notice the importance of living animals. Some children may work as biologists or veterinaries in the future. But animals' lives in zoos are virtual in a way. Animals in zoos don't search for food, water, and habitats themselves. They eat and drink what they are given and sleep in concrete buildings. They don't search for their mates and they don't take care of their off-spring themselves. Humans make and take care of an animal's family. Humans keep animals healthy in zoos. It isn't a natural way for animals. If we want to see the real animal life, we have to jump into nature, but it takes an enormous amount of time and money. Otherwise, we can feel the essence of animal life in a movie or TV video program. I think it is a better way to know the real animal life than going to zoos.

We all know exercise is really good for our health. There are a lot of reasons for us to do exercise. I love exercise. I do exercise every day. I like many sports such as swimming, hiking the mountain and especially badminton. I usually play badminton 3 times a week at house culture near my house with my friends. I enjoy Pilates but I don't have any chance to take part in this class. When I exercise, I prefer exercising outside to exercising at a gym because doing exercise outside you not only enjoy the fresh air, but also see a lot of beautiful views. You won't feel bored because there are 4 walls around you. Not only that, exercise also reduces your stress. You will forget all of your problems and unhappy things. You will feel relaxed and comfortable. At the same time, you also make good relationships with other friends and have a fun talk with them. So why don't you try do exercise once? Therefore, we should do exercise more and as much as we can before it is too late. I will also do exercise more and more in the near future.

My favorite season of the year is summer because I am a summer girl. Just joking. I have three reasons why I chose summer as my favorite. Firstly, I like the weather. Blue sky and white clouds. I hate the humidity of Japanese summer, but it is surmounted by the clear sky. I love the fine weather of summer. Secondly, its number of events, for example, BBQs, sea bathing, fireworks, and sunflowers. I like all of them. They are there only in summer and are enjoyable. I cannot conceive of my summer without them. I want to live like a sunflower. Thirdly, my birthday. My birthday is in July, so to be honest, I am a summer girl as I said. Well, I live a year to live in summer. I hope it will be a calm summer this year. No more pandemic or natural disasters.

My answer is to close to call I believe, but I prefer to have a short and intense life, I guess, owing to the fact that I know perfectly that living until 100 years isn't always a fine option for everyone. I mean, clearly, nobody wants a boring life and, by the way, me neither, because human beings need to make the world great again. To continue, everyone should do something useful for our world. Consequently, you should have a smart plan, with the aim of doing something well for humanity, such as creating a smart invention or discovering a new planet likewise. In addition, I prefer to have a good life and succeed in it, than to have a long life and feel like I have not appreciated it enough or I will feel that my life has missed something. Actually this situation is scaring me because I know I'm still young and my life is far ahead of me yet. Life is short, there is no doubt about it. Thus, I do everything I can to have a better life, I learn every day and I'm organizing my future as much as possible, to be sure I'm gonna be safe and happy. Hence, I recommend you to do the same thing, I hope you agree with me otherwise you can send me your idea.

The school of the future will be different compared to the school right now. People have learned the benefits of the home office due to the quarantine situation. Maybe, school in the future will be more virtual like with online classes and the students will take their exam online. However, I think this is not healthy. The role of a school is much bigger than learning math or biology. A school is like a microcosm of the world. In school, you coexist with different people, you learn how to be a citizen (or it should be like this). Teaching methods are antiquated, they separate subjects. Maybe, in the future, subjects can be more connected. If we can do this, as Edgar Morin dreamed, it will benefit all humankind. This way, morality and biology will be more connected, and people will realize their role in the environment . They will understand why is it wrong to degrade the environment.

I think that zoos are good places to learn about animals for people, especially young children. There are two reasons below. Firstly, zoos offer opportunities to come into contact with many kinds of animals. I believe that spending time with animals has a positive impact on children's emotional development. If they did not exist, children living in a big city such as Tokyo, New York, and so on might not be able to see or have contact with any animals in their daily life, and it might have a negative impact on them. Secondly, they have really important features such as not only being entertainment for people but also contributing to the preservation of species by providing information about the lives of several kinds of animals to some organizations. We should tell children how zoos help our society through those activities. For those reasons, zoos are good places for young children to learn about animals.

I found this tool in a website for improving writing, such as an essay or leaflet and letter or whatever is relevant for writing skills.

I think there are many advantages to studying abroad. First, students can get a lot of experiences which they cannot experience in their own country. They may feel a culture gap when they meet a foreign culture, but they may notice that their knowledge about the world is limited. Second, students can learn the importance of diversity when they meet people with a different philosophy, religion, culture, and different customs. They can respect each other if they understand diversity. To understand other people is quite difficult, but young people can adapt to the specific situation more easily than old people do. I think the younger, the better. The disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost of it. They need a lot of money for their studying and living there. In addition, they have to leave their home and live apart from their family members. It may cause some mental problems. I think the advantages are many more than the disadvantages of studying abroad.

I think that there are two advantages and one disadvantage of students studying abroad during high school or university. The first advantage is that you can see several perspectives by studying abroad instead of studying in your country at an early age. It would definitely broaden your insight and your way of thinking. The second one is that having experiences might be beneficial for your career. For instance, if you wanted to talk about your experiences to people who were eager to study abroad, it would be really helpful for you to recognize the differences in education between your country and the country you studied in. However, the only disadvantage of studying abroad is security. If you live in a secure place such as Japan, something dangerous might happen during your stay abroad. So you should be more careful and try to be alert to protect yourself in another country.

Nowadays, there are many entertainment shows on television. They can be good, but can also bring huge negative impacts. In spite of that, there are also communities of people that say that television can also be used for educational purposes. Is that a logical statement? Well, since there are so many uninstructive shows on television, it is hard to say that television can also educate. I know that there are also many educational shows, but in my country, people prefer to watch entertaining but uninstructive shows. Those entertaining shows can have positive impacts if the audience are wise. But mostly, entertaining shows are having enormously negative impacts, especially on children and teenagers because they tend to follow what they have seen; in this case, the actors of the entertainment shows. However, there are television shows which are produced for educational purposes. If most people show their discretion about filtering television shows, we can finally say that television entertains, but it can also educate.

The best holiday for me was a trip to Guam in February, 2013, to which my boss brought all employees for the 10th anniversary since the company had been established in 2003. Actually, I was a little nervous before leaving Japan because it was my first trip abroad. Moreover, I am afraid of heights so it was like a nightmare during the four-hour flight from Narita Airport to Guam. However, as soon as we got to the airport there, my best trip got started. All I could see there, such as the Pacific Ocean, beautiful palms, local food, clean and organized hotel rooms, and kind and nice people, was amazing. I went shopping to buy something for my family and friends, hung around the island, and went to some places where Japanese soldiers died during World War II. I prayed for them. Anyways, these experiences were very memorable for me, I stayed there for only three days though. If my English got much better, I would definitely like to visit Guam again and communicate with the local people.

Controversy over incorporating volunteer work in high schools' requirements for registration has continued during the past few years. Some laud its benefits while others do not. In this essay I intend to argue about the subject and interefere the advantages and disadvantages. Research has recently shown teenagers who are used to working as volunteers in different jobs have more responsibility to accept their role in society. As they devote some of hours in a week to a week for sacrificing job, therefore their understanding of difficult situations increases and they have more potential to make a decision in crises. On the other hand, some families prefer to enroll their teenagers in different classes and make the most of their free time. They think young people should learn various skills to have more options in the future to choose from. By way of conclusion, I believe that, as the personality of teenagers can be entirely different, parents and school authorities should consider their behavior as the determining key to help them to improve themselves and volunteer work. Although it is a sign of a sacrifing soul, it must not be a requirement for registration in high school.

I'm pleased with my English learning in this school year. I started learning it almost 2 years ago, and I still continue my online English lessons. I already finished one English course named the Callan method and I am retaking it from the beginning. In addition, I try to write reports in English every day to improve my writing skills. I want to improve my running skills in this new school year. I jog for a short period of time every day, but I don't satisfy my routine work. My running goal is running a complete ultra-marathon. An ultra-marathon is running over 42 kilometers and this crazy marathon has become more popular these days. I want to develop physical endurance for a long-distance run. I want to strengthen the core of my body. To achieve my goals, I will squat, do planks, push-ups, and sit-ups 100 times per day. Also, I will try to run for a longer time and distance than usual. I will run on mountains or trails to strengthen my leg muscles.

I use a computer every day. I usually use it for working, watching videos and playing games. I enjoy playing computer games, most especially a online game in which I can talk and play with my friends without going out to meet them in person. Moreover, the computer graphics are marvellous.

Learning a foreign language has always been an important thing in life. Obviously, in our whole history people have travelled a lot. Hence, they have needed to know other languages. Earlier, the most suitable language was the Latin language. However, today most people are learning English. This being the case, I honestly believe that nowadays learning to speak a foreign language is as important as it was in the past. Of course, nowadays people travel around the world, they speak with people from other countries, or even work with foreigners. Therefore, they have to speak an alternative language to communicate with co-workers. What's more relevant, presently companies employ workers who know other languages apart from their native one. Knowing a foreign language is very valuable these days. Without it, we can't achieve what we want, for example an excellent job. Nowadays, almost everything is based on knowing at least two different languages. Surely, I can't imagine not knowing another language. Knowing a foreign language is such a meaningful thing these days. Honestly, in my opinion, people should learn at least two foreign languages for a better communication with other people.

I like to exercise. I usually exercise about three to five times a week. I prefer indoor exercise because my room has air conditioning and I can wear an exercise bra without worrying about other people seeing. I like anaerobic dancing most because it improves my body coordination skill and its music makes me forget about my tiredness.

Hey Billal Last week I went to San Francisco with my college friends! We were visiting the Gay Parade, the biggest parade in the world, when we found Hailey! She is the best singer ever and I love her songs! This was my favourite trip because I enjoyed the city with my friends. On the other hand, we didn't stay at the hotel that we had planned, because it was completely full. I didn't believe it when the receptionist told us that! Thus, this wasn't the perfect trip, but always will be my favorite!

As you know, exercise is a very important thing for us to keep our lives healthier, more joyful, and more productive. However, I think that there are more important things in our life. Here are the things. First, establishing a good relationship with people around you, such as your family, colleagues, co-workers, friends, and so on, is really important. The more all of you are cooperative, the more all of you can help each other with anything. You can focus on what you should focus on without annoying relationships. Second, you should earn money and save it as much as you can to survive in this world which is getting much harder and harder to live in, which makes your life easier, I think. Overall, exercise is a very important thing for us to keep our lives healthier, more joyful, and more productive. However, I think that there are more important things in our life, such as good relationships with people, and making and saving money.

I've been studying English all my life. I didn't have any title to show for this so, last year, I decided to study English through the UNED University. Our teacher recommend some websites to us to improve our English level. This year, I'm studying Beginner level. I'm using a website called "Write & Improve." I think it helps me a lot and I agree with the fact that it improves my English level. I use it to write some text and I like it because it can permit me to know which mistakes I have made. I recommend it because it is very useful for everybody. It has got different levels and it is very easy to use. There isn't anything I don't like. Maybe I don't like that I have finished Beginner level and now I'm trying to practise Intermediate level to continue improving my English level.

There is no doubt these days a lot of doctors are moving to important cities. The question is, what are the causes for doctors moving and how could we solve this problem? In this essay I will discuss the causes and solutions and draw my own opinion. In terms of reasons, moving to the towns has different causes. Firstly, the significant one is less income in the countryside compared with other places because people who live in those places do not have so much money so they cannot pay all the bills for the doctor. A lot of them are very poor without any money. Secondly, in villages they miss improving machens machines which help doctors to do their job in a perfect way. However, there are some solutions that could help. Firstly, increasing doctors' salaries for those who work in the countryside to chering them work in these places. Also, bringing technical machines to their clinics. In conclusion, there are reasons for this problem and some people gave solutions. Therefore, I believe that to encourage doctors to stay and work forever in villages, we must give them financial offers like a free home and financial or special promotion.

Who does not want to have a healthy, intense life? Each individual desires and aspires to have a long, meaningful life. However, they do know how to adjust life to become a beautiful and meaningful one, whether it is short or long, don't they ? Let discuss this scenario. Nowadays, the majority of people choose the same trail as others. They do not prefer to stand out, they sustain to imitate others in their daily lives, they have a lack of courage in order to upgrade their lives to a different story whilst they obtain enough ability and qualities to meet the standard to change life. As a consequence, this causes oddly flat lives which means there is nothing special, outstanding, remarkable and extraordinary. This is kind of peculiar for everyone. For me, the way you spend your life is really vital. You would be able to turn your life into a better one if you actually knew certain methods. In my opinion, I would say I like to spend life much more intensely by doing what I want to do, being myself with no struggles or controls by anyone. I think it is a bit challenging and problematic. I believe I still can pass those difficulties though, by trying my best, making progress and efforts, accumulating experience from mistakes and making preparations for the process of being successful. In addition to this, life can be more intense and meaningful when you devote time to your close relatives, friends and your family who are always by your side all the time, who encourage and motivate you to do the best thing. It is a beautiful, glorious and wonderful thing in the world.

I think an office which has a more open design is more effective for workers. In addition to that, it is safer for workers' health to protect them from the virus in this urgent situation or in the coming new normal situation. I have three reasons to support my opinions of open office efficiency. Firstly, we don't have anxiety about concentrating too much on our tasks. I mean just looking up, we can change our mind if we are in a difficult situation. It is very effective to do the work as soon as possible. Secondly, it is easy to communicate with co-workers. We don't need to hesitate to ask questions or advice. It is also effective for team building. Thirdly, it is useful to understand each other. We can see how co-workers work. Some people can steal the way which an active worker works, others can learn from negative examples. It is effective to make our performance better. Furthermore, we have to protect ourselves from COVID-19 wherever we are from now on. With open offices, we can make spaces between workers. It calms us down to work in the office. In conclusion, I think that open workstations are more effective.

My town is in Romania. It is a small and peaceful town, old and with an important history that it makes it special and very visited by many people around the world. There are not too many landmarks because, like I said, this town is not so extensive. Also, in my town there are limited shops or markets where you can buy food. The community is friendly and nice thus the accommodation should not represent a problem. In Alba Iulia there are two big parks in the whole town, a few museums and multiple restaurants. About what the night time entertainment consists of, there are so many clubs, free concerts in several restaurants or open-air concerts.

The Future of Travel Currently, we have a lot of options to travel all around the world. Highly-developed transportation systems, such as airplanes, ferries, and trains make it much easier to travel to wherever we want to visit. However, the world is dramatically changing in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our activities are being strictly limited, and we have to stay home and work remotely without commuting. I imagine that this situation will make our travel experiences change in the future. For instance, it would be difficult to get a visa to travel or stay in other countries because each government would hesitate to approve it to prevent spreading the virus. As a result, the cost of travelling to another country would increase, whereas, our trip to major sightseeing spots could be more comfortable and enjoyable because of a decrease in the crowds of people. Anyways, because of the corona virus situation, the future of travel will be changed.

Hello. My name is Sam and I am 14 years old. I like playing games and every kid and adult likes it, but some parents don't want their children to play games. They think it is a bad habit for their child. Of course, they think it isn't good for children, but sometimes kids or adult need to play games in their free times and parents need to watch their kids, like how many hours they play games. This can be very helpful, and if you can't watch your kids or you don't have free time then your children can play at the weekend. At the weekend all the workplaces and schools are closed. At the weekend, you will play or watch your kids. That's the best way to control your children. In the 21st century most kids like to play games in their free times. I think that's right and I also play games at the weekend, but if you want to play games you have to play for 2 or 3 hours at a weekend. Then your parents think, "Our child is playing games for a little bit," and you have to do your school homework and your parents will say, "Our child is playing games and also doing homework." After that, they will be happy and are not gonna stop you from playing games. That's all for my suggestion.

I think there are mostly three reasons why doctors are few in rural areas. Firstly, it is difficult to install enough equipment. I mean it's difficult to distinguish what is to be installed or not because predicting the patients' character is hard. Secondly, it is difficult to hire nurses and receptionists. There are not many expert nurses and receptionists in the countryside, as well as doctors. Doctors cannot open their clinic alone. Thirdly, it is difficult to gather patients. Many are elderly people in the countryside. Since they tend to have chronic diseases, they go to a big hospital in the city center. That is why they have a family doctor there, it is hard to gather patients to a town clinic. Well, I think we can solve it now. We need to develop online medical care. Wherever the patients are, they can see a doctor in a city. It is beneficial for not only the elderly people in the countryside but also everyone who is sick. These are all of my opinions. I hope everyone who needs medical care can get enough treatment.

I have studied for a lot of years. I have studied at a school, at a high school, at a university and learnt different skills throughout my life. I have known different teachers and I have had good teachers and bad teachers. I'll never forget a special teacher and friend of me. His name was "Txus." He was my Spanish language teacher in my high school. He was a good teacher and finally he became my friend. He taught me a way of writing my texts that I had never known before. He was a friendly man with everybody. I would like to have had this teacher for more years, but they changed our teachers every two years. I remember a bad teacher. His name was "Carlos." He was a friendly man, but he gave us very difficult exams. I hated him, but I was lucky because next year he became unemployed. I think that it is good to change teachers every year if it is possible because I can meet different people and that is a good thing to build my education. But I think it is a pity that I meet amazing people and I must change teachers every two years and maybe I have moody and bad teachers. This situation is what is happening to our younger son now.

In my opinion, volunteer work for high school students is a good idea for various reasons. First, volunteer work enables the students to learn something about the community they are part of. This can be related to health care, culture or education. They will also learn more about the needed of elderly people who live in care homes. For instance, inhabitants of care homes need social contact and students will enable them to have social contact. Because of volunteer work, students enhance the environment that they live in. For example, they enable the elderly people who have minimum social contact to revive their social life. Secondly, in many wealthy countries the government subsidises the school cost through the tax that it levies. So it is very important that student do volunteer work in attempt to support the community who finance their schools. Lastly, volunteer work enriches the social development of the student. Through volunteer work, students will come in contact with people who work in different fields or have different backgrounds.

A music class brings students fun! It also encourages them to take up a music profession for their future. In general, lots of experiences provide students with a variety of thoughts, deep sentimentsm, and knowledge of a human being. Firstly, I think studying music is good for students, nothing bad however, it doesn't mean forcing them to take a music class. This is simply because some of them might prefer arts, drawing and painting rather than music. Back in the days, my high school had a mandatory class which you could choose. You could select one from arts, music or DT. I strongly recommend the students should have an experience but it should be the class which they prefer. Secondly, I would like to mention an "experience." When I was a high school student, I didn't fancy any of those, therefore I took a music class. The class offered me to sing the Beethoven No.9 in German. It seemed to be amazingly impossible, however, we pronounced German like Japanese "Katakana" and accomplished it. This experience reminds me of a satisfactory accomplishment. I can still sing it in German. I feel the experience makes your life confident. Therefore, I don't think all students should have to study music, but I think they need to have some experience in their youthful days.

The best holiday I went on was a camping tour around the US national parks. It was 25 years ago, but I can still remember every scene of this tour. This tour lasted two weeks and its participants came from several countries, such as England, Germany, France, and Japan. I was the only Japanese person and the others came from Europe. We had to talk to each other in English and it was a hard time for me, but I did it. We visited several national parks in the western part of the United States. We hiked the mountains, rode on horses, and learned about nature and wild animals at the visitor centers. We stayed at the camping site and cooked for ourselves. Each of us cooked their country's dishes and served each other. We enjoyed the international foods and cultures throughout the tour. It was an amazing and interesting experience for me. I think this holiday made me to focus on foreign people and gave me the opportunity to join volunteer work in foreign countries.

Learning a language can prove to be a very useful thing to do. Why do I think so? It's pretty obvious, the more languages we know, the easier it becomes for us to communicate with large communities of people around the entire world. But what if I don't want any new friends? Is there any other reason why I should be eager to even start learning some brand new foreign language? If you ask me, yes there are a bunch of other reasons to consider starting this amazing journey. For example, you get exposed to a completely new culture and oftentimes you fall in love with it. It shouldn't be that hard to conclude on your own, but because this argument is so obvious, a lot of people tend to avoid it whenever they encounter this subject of learning a new language. Also, speaking a foreign language can be extremely helpful when you decide that you'd like to spend your holidays abroad because, let's not deceive ourselves, not everybody in the country that you want to visit speaks English. They inhabit some country where various languages are spoken, so essentially they don't see any need to study some other tongue.

In spring, you don 't sweat because it 's not very hot and it is windy. Moreover, I was born in March and in this month the season is winter and spring, so I celebrate my birthday in these two seasons. On the other hand, I like winter too because I celebrate Christmas with my family. In winter, I am fond of snow because I find it fantastic, amazing, and unbelievable.

Many people contend that exercising contributes to a healthy lifestyle. Still, very few of them are actually living according to these standards. Especially students. Schools are questioning whether to force their pupils to participate in sports at least three times a week. However, is forcing children to exercise really a way to improve their lifestyles? Obviously, a daily schedule involving exercising should rather be considered as habitual. Despite this fact, it should not be forced upon students by their school to implement exercising in their schedules. This because every individual has individual needs and therefore, it could provide complications for people who are not made to exercise so many times a week. They might suffer from health problems or are sensitive to injuries. While there is nothing wrong with encouraging pupils to live a healthy lifestyle, it could induce major health problems for those who are not strong enough to exercise at least three times a week. Secondly, forcing people to execute something they might not be interested in, has proven to be ineffective throughout history. When someone is forced to perform they will not experience any enjoyment in the particular activity. This might not need to be a problem when they are still in school, while there is no other choice than to obey. But it could lead to a life-long negative association with certain sports, which could prevent them from seeking enjoyment in exercising ever again. Automatically, this leads to a preposterous effect compared to the initial aspiration. I can honestly say that forcing pupils to exercise is not the right way to achieve the aim of them living a healthy lifestyle. This could be accomplished in various ways, such as motivating them to reach a personally set aim. What might be the most important requirement is that schools should accept that not everyone is interested in accomplishing a healthy lifestyle by performing physical exercise. They should undertake nothing more than simply motivating their pupils.

There is no doubt that these days the media are important tools for governments and TV is the most important kind of media. The question is, is television could? I will discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of the negative side, people say television is just for entertainment. The main reason they give is TV could wies time for everyone even if they are enjoying through it. To illustrate that, usually the media teach bad habits, like drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking drugs. In other words, they portray criminals as good people. However, other people against them they were optimistic about TV like every things has advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, we could get knowledge from channels, like those about science, math, and politics. Secondly, it shows us the environment everywhere around the world, also inside the sea. Lastly, it given a chance for everybody to study and learn new things like language or religion. In conclusion, some people say we can learn a lot of new things from the media, but others are against them. NA,.

In my opinion, both of these choices have their positive and negative aspects. Since I have experienced both situations, I can say that living away from my family for a while has developed my personality and it was a valuable experience for me. When I was a student in high school, I was living with my family. At that time, I was not worried about my food or my expenses at all. I knew that when I arrived home, everything was ready for me. The only thing which was expected from me was only studying. Furthermore, when I got sick, my parents took care of me, and I healed very soon. But when I decided to get out of my comfort zone and choose to live away from my family, I knew that it would be an awkward situation but it would help me to become independent. I have lived 6 years away from my family, and I have learned to manage my expenses and take care of my health and build a strong personality without my parents' help. However, I am not suggesting this way to all students, because it depends on the person's personality and characteristics. In conclusion, maybe the experience of living alone during the studying at university is hard, but I think it has this ability to pull out a person's ability and be helpful to become a more independent and responsible person.

This topic is mostly interesting nowadays. Why are the villages and rural areas so lacking in more services and moreover the quality of them? In my opinion, this problem is popular in many countries. Village citizens usually complain about the long hours they spend when they are travelling to the main cities to do some work, especially for treatment or government services. That is what the people are facing when living in rural areas. In terms of solutions there are many ways to repair this obstacle. One of these methods is creating projects to build health care centres in each village with high level of quality and services and provide some offers for the doctor who accepts the vacancy to work in rural areas such as a high salary, strong health insurance, registration in school for their kids and housing without charge. I think giving some incentives for doctors to leave their home and work in an area with low living potential is considered the right way to attract them to serve those people living there and solve the problem.

My home town is João Pessoa, capital of the state of Paraiba. There are many shopping centres, but the most important are Mangabeira and Manaira Shopping! There are also many hotels on the beach for your accommodation, but they are very expensive, so if you want to visit my home town, bring plenty of money with you! My favourite museum is the Science Station, and it's an important landmark in the city!

I have been a student and I know that in that period you don't think only about studying, but you think about hanging out with your friends and having a good time. So it's an age at which you can't appreciate the importance of studying or the importance of school, so it's not simple at all to be a teacher. For this reason, in my opinion it is good for students to have new teachers each year, because in this way they can be more stimulated, they can learn several things, they can have a different view of life from each teacher, and they can also get their experience. And all these things could make them better people. You have to consider that usually students don't know what they want, so having different teachers could help them find their way, while having a single teacher for a long time could get boring, as you can imagine.

In my opinion, I think students benefit more from having new teachers each year. Firstly, the students will have a lot of opportunities to learn with other teaching methods. They also have many new experiences through many teaching methods. Secondly, the students will be boler to interact with new teachers each year. Thirdly, each teacher will have their own experience to talk about with the students. Thereby, the students will understand their teacher. Fourthly, each teacher also has their own methods of studying so they can share those with students. Fifthly, if the students learn with a new teacher each year , they will adapt quickly to a new study environment. So it improves the adaptive skills of students. Finally, each teacher will have a sight to students, many teachers will have a sight to students, many teachers will have comprehensive sight to assess students. From that, they will give proper methods and advice to their students. I hope the students should try learn new teacher each year. You will be more successful, if you have more challenges.

My opinion is that changing teachers every year is better than learning from a teacher for many years. I will prove this with four reasons below. First, if you have a new teacher every year you can compare their teaching with that of the old teacher, then you can find the method that's right for you. Second, diverse teaching methods will not make you bored. you will learn a lot of experience from them. Third, you will have more memories of this time and you have open relationships. Finally, each teacher has a unique personality, which is the basis of future communication in a work environment. You experience different personalities and how to solve problems in similar situations. NA,. you are always ready and constantly learning to have more knowledge.

I think my favourite season of the year is spring. I like this season because it's the season that brings life back to the whole of nature. It's a season that is not so cold and it's not so hot, it is just the perfect weather. I like to see the trees coming back to life, I like to hear the birds singing. Want I want to do in this season is to go and visit different places and meet new people. The best thing about this season is the fact that it brings back the power of the sun, it brings everything back to life. Next spring I would like to go and visit Deva with my family. Deva is a really great city. I remember that I saw it last autumn and it was great. The only problem is that I have to take an airplane to Timisoara and then rent a car so I can go to Deva, and that is a problem.

We know that doctors want to get a lot of money. If they can go to big cities, with a lot of opportunities, they will go. However, the small cities and rural areas need doctors. They don't have enough doctors. I suggest that the government should make some program to give reasons to the doctors to go to these places. For instance, an additional salary or some kind of advantages, like a free house to live in, or a year's bonus in money. I guess that when a doctor goes to a small city or to a rural area, in a short time he will be so happy with the value the population gives to him, he is going to be interested in continuing in these places. Of course, the doctors can want to receive money, but they need to understand this kind of profession is so important for society, they must consider some things besides the cash.

I like playing video games but I don't have enough time. My children like playing video games a lot. I think that playing video games has good things and bad things. Video games are good because they can teach us a lot of things. There are a lot of types of video games. Some are strategic video games, where we should use our brain to win a competition. Another type of video games are sports games. My younger son knows all the countries with their flags. He is only 11 years old. He sees these flags in a football video game. What is the problem with video games? In my opinion, a lot of children spend many hours sitting opposite a TV playing video games. Some have problems talking with people or having friends and they are often shy. We should put a limit on the use of video games. My children play one hour in the summer season because they don't go to school. They only play video games at the weekends during the course period.

I agree with people that claim the idea that it is a good thing for students to have the same teacher for several years. The first argument I am bringing forward to the idea that I support is represented by the fact that a teacher that teaches a subject in the same class for several years gets to know his pupils' knowledge of what he teaches, and this skill is increased through the time the teacher gets to interact with his students. A time in which the teacher gives his students several projects, tests, and homework to complete . The second argument that I am bringing forward to support my opinion consists in the fact that a teacher that teaches for several years gets to know the level of the class that he is teaching, so that he will be able to learn their pupils lessons that they do not understand or know, will be able to interact more easily with them and give them tasks that they are going to understand, and improve their behaviour at school and in society compared to a teacher that teaches pupils for the first time in that year. To conclude, I would like to propose that there are more benefits of a teacher who teaches a class for several years than of a teacher that teaches for one year.

I like exercising but unfortunately I can't do it very often because I'm busy with my job. Generally I'm able to do it once per week and I prefer exercising outside and not in the gym because in this way you can stay more in contact with nature.

Hi Charlie, I was thinking about you a few days ago and now I would like to tell you about my favourite film. It is the "Back to the future" series, where the main role is played by Michael J. Fox. The first part of the series was released around 1980 and it was a big success all around the world. Generally the story of the film talks about time travelling. Doctor Emmet Brown discovers a machine which allows people to travel in time. From that argument, the movie starts and after that we have a great story to watch. The series has three parts and each of them takes place in different times. You should see this movie because besides it having a great plot you can have a laugh or be scared while watching it.

I have recently discovered a new tool for English writing improvement: Write and Improve. This app was developed by Cambridge University, one of the most important study centres in the United Kingdom, where you can find some useful information to write really good texts, or simply to prepare for Cambridge exams. You only have to log on the application, enter workbooks and choose the writing information you prefer to write. Then just write lots of interesting documents! On the one hand, it is helpful because it corrects your mistakes and says what you have to improve with organized feedback. Moreover. you can see your writing level on the top right, and if you rise to a higher category, you will get a more difficult language level. On the other hand, although this will help you, there are some things that I would like to change. First, it could have a vocabulary book or something similar, for weak English students who want to do Cambridge exams, then writing models, to know how to do your texts, and finally more help with corrections. However, since I have known this app, I have improved my English level much more and it is awesome. In conclusion, I recommend it for all English learners because it is a useful tool to develop new abilities in essays and writings. If you use it, you will obtain amazing results!

I agree with the statement above. In my opinion, health is more important than wealth. Wealth could help you very much to be healthy, but if you have a very serious illness wealth does not have any worth. Like I said, if you are rich you can buy good medicines, you can go to a private hospital with the best specialists, you can eat only the best quality food, and all that could allow you to live in good health and maybe longer. But in my opinion if you do not have money you could also live long and in good shape. You have to care about your diet and generally about the shape you are in. Do not drink, do not smoke, and stuff like that. The main problem is when you have a lot of money, but you are ill and doctors do not give you too many years to live. Then your wealth is worth nothing to you.

There is no doubt that these days a lot of researchers are looking for new ways to improve education methods and others prefer to maintain the traditional style of learning. The question is, will education methods be different in the future or is everything going to be the same? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of the causes for changing the education methods in the future, some people say technology will replace paper. The main reason they give is that books and notebooks have a lot of disadvantages, because of that they think devices are suitable for the centery. To illustrate that, iPads, computers, and other things will have everything like Students will do homework and send it in without using any pens. In other words, the education methods will be powerful and helpful. On the other hand, other scientists think continuing in the same way is good for young students. The results of studies say that to improve children's skills you have to teach them in the old ways like teaching them to write by hand. Technical subjects will be more important than arts and this will make everybody good at technology. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to use all of them. Improving modern and traditional ways together would be a fabulous future for learners.

I think there are things that are very important for our health. Exercise is absolutely important, but it isn't the only way to keep our health. Eating healthy food at regular times is important. We should eat balanced meals regularly. In addition, we should control the nutrition and volume of our meals. Eating too much is bad for health. It causes high blood glucose. We have to eat a determined amount of calories divided by 6 times in a day to keep a proper blood glucose value. Deep sleep for 8 hours is also important for our health. Good sleep makes our bodies healthy. In order to sleep well, we shouldn't eat anything 2 hours before going to bed. Avoiding stress in daily life is very important. We need a suitable level of stress to keep our motivation in our job or private lives, but an excessive level of stress may cause illness not only in our bodies, but also in our mind. There are many things that are very important for our health besides exercise. But the most important thing is to continue these activities every day.

I think that Write&Improve is one of the best programs that a learning student can use in order to improve their learning skills. This program is so great that I use it every day in order to improve my writing skills.

If someone ever asks me which was the best holiday I have ever been on, I would definitively say that it was the one I went on last summer. To start with, in July of 2019, my family and I decided to go to the south of Spain to visit some wonderful and astonishing beaches on the seaside. We set off in July and came back in August. We felt so grateful when we arrived and saw how well cared for and gorgeous the beaches were in Spain. First of all, we checked into the hotel and unpacked, then we took notice of a lot of trip advertisements in the hotel and determined to start with a scuba diving lesson 24 miles away from the coast. It was just incredible, an unforgettable experience in which we got to see uncountable species of fish and marine life. The next day, we went on a kayak trip towards the "Agua Dulce" port. And the last day, we did some tourism around the city and visited a huge aquarium in which we could touch sharks. We saw several famous monuments, and finally, we visited the best restaurant in the city.

If my children play video games I will not agree with this because I consider that video games do not improve their behaviour, their temper, or their vocabulary. I consider that video games will not improve or develop the players. Furthermore, I think that video games will destroy their perspective of the world, of people, and their concern about their future. Also I think that a child that doesn't play video games is more productive, more social, and friendlier with people around them, as opposed to a child who plays video games in their free time, who gives all their attention and energy to video games and does not pay attention to interaction with other people that go to the same school as them . I also consider that the children that do not play video games are more successfully than children that play video games because they are more concerned about their life, their behaviour and their development.

You just graduated and now the next part of your life is about to begin: university. But when it comes to the housing situation during this time, opinions differ. Some negotiate living at home with your family is the best option, whereas others argue living on your own is the best choice possibly taken. Actually both options have their positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, living on your own obviously helps becoming more confident and reliable but simultaneously responsibility increases a lot. You have to buy your own groceries, do your laundry, tidy up, pay your bills and cook for yourself. Meanwhile you have the opportunity to do whatever you want - if it is not illegal though - and have experiences with being independent on your own. On the other hand, those responsibilities need a lot of your time, which is less while living with your family. Your mother might be very gentle and do your laundry, cook dinner for you and iron your blouses, whereas throwing a party with your new friends could not amaze them here the same way as you. As a conclusion, it is important to mention that everyone prefers a different way of living and there is nothing wrong with it at all.

In the past when I studied in Bandung, almost every day I ran in Poltek's field. Then when I routinely joined Zumba I did it 2 times a week every Monday and Thursday. But because of the Corona pandemic issue, the Zumba place closed. I felt confused for a moment. What kind of exercise should I do?

There are both positive and negative effects of video games on children. A benefit of video games is training eye-hand coordination, which is the basis of many tasks in children's life. Moreover, children who play video games have better problem-solving skills as they are exposed to new puzzles in the games. However, the disadvantages of video games are much more than the advantages. Most families suffer from their children's inappropriate behaviour copied from a violent situation in fighting video games, which are the most popular type of game. Many crimes are committed by game players who imitate game characters' harmful actions. Another negative effect of video games which has a great impact on preschool children is a language problem resulting from a limited interpersonal interaction and a one-way communication between children and a video screen. It is normal to see a toddler watching YouTube clips or playing mobile phone games by himself while his parents are also using their phones separately. Moreover, it causes many long-term health problems, such as nearsightedness, muscle soreness, constipation, and social problems. In conclusion, even though video games give children manual skills, their disadvantages affect children's life severely. Therefore, parents must control their children's playtime to balance the benefits and the drawbacks caused by playing games.

Well, I guess that there are advantages in both spaces. If you need to be more concentrated, it could be better to have a space only for you, but if you need some time to interact with your partners, it would be better to have an open design. Another question is the kind of work. If you want to produce, only produce, you must be fast. In this case there is no problem to stay in open spaces, which could be better. However, if you need to be creative, to produce new ideas, for instance, you could choose, because for some people it is better to have other people around. For others it is very important to be alone, quiet, to think deeply about the topic, the issue and the goal. Maybe he doesn't want to have any noise. So it is a question of the place, it depends on the job, it depends on the person and it depends on the conditions.

There is no doubt these days the important schools have special requests as a volunteer activity. The question is, is the volunteer activity helpful for students or not? In this essay I am going to discuss both views and draw my own opinion. In terms of volunteering advantages, some people say they will improve personal skills. The main reason they give to support this idea is that students need a realistic experience in real situations. To illustrate that, helping people will develop their character, letting them see life as it was without any change. In other words, these activities teach them how to be flexible dealing with complex problems and ways to solve them as they can. On the contrary, some people say there are disadvantages to volunteering. Firstly, it will make students less focused on their studying and subjects, this because they spend a long time on these activities. Secondly, some of the volunteering activities are dangerous for young students, maybe they have a risk like relegions for poor people who do not have a safety system. In conclusion, there are a lot of opinions about this subject. All of them have a good cause to show their views. Therefore, I believe that volunteer activities are useful and they give students a chance to see another side of the world.

Dear Sir or Madam, Due to the latest idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport, in shops and restaurants, I am writing to you. Nowadays mobile phones are included in our daily life as well as food or clothing. The problem is that many people are being distracted by them during situations that need special attention. The amount of casualties a year caused by distraction due to a mobile phone is in fact increasingly high. Therefore, I would genuinely recommend them being banned. It is not just dangerous, but our social life basically suffers a lot from the immense use. You can see families sitting at a table in a restaurant not talking to each other, while each and everyone of them is glaring at a screen in front of them. To some extent you need to have your phone with you and it is also very useful in some situations, but we all should not forget our ancestors survived without them too. Of course you can negotiat many listen to music, read or play games on their mobile phone, but to me this is as distracting as everything else. Anyways, I should mention that my phone is used by myself very often too, but I tremendously suggest trying to enforce this ban because our social life will benefit a lot from it.

Office design Nowadays, due to the lively changes in the office working environment, more and more employers get to crowd all their employees into a large room and their activity is supposed to be accomplished due to very efficient teamwork. I believe that all this is nonsense, that this is just a myth that would cover the economy that the employer is making in renting a much cheaper space that will maximize the company's earnings. I truly believe that the employees are within their rights to benefit from a personal workplace, which will provide them with a quiet and private work experience that will allow them to focus better and be even more productive. Employers should take notice of the fact that a shared workplace cannot be properly aired and so respiratory issues appear. If the place they work in was not jeopardizing their health, the employees would work longer and it would be beneficial in the long run for the company they work for. Moreover, working separately will prevent diseases from being spread, as the workers will get less in contact with each other especially during the cold season when the flu is viral. The fewer people breathe the same air the better. In addition, claustrophobic people will feel safer and their affliction will not encounter with their work. It is proven that a better organisation brings a consistent increase in productivity. To sum up, each and every employee should be provided with his own place in order to focus on his work and to not jeopardize his health and the others'.

There is no doubt these days university students need to decide where they should live. The question is, what is the best choice for them, is it away from their home or with family? In this essay I am going to discuss both views and draw my own opinion. In terms of advantages of living away from their home, the main reason they give is they need to develop independence, which is really important to live a life. To illustrate that, moving will teach them how to be responsible for doing everything themselves. In other words, they have to take on their responsibilities without any helper. NA,. others say being at home with parents is useful for students at university. Firstly, at this early age of their life, they need support and courage from family, bachaloria is tough and hard without family support so students maybe fail. Secondly, they improve social skills through contact with family members at home. In conclusion, people have different ideas for students' life. Therefore, I believe that the best choice for students during their university days, if they are studying on the city where their family lives, is with family. They will find support and do not need to take on significant responsibilities.

As you know, television entertains us, but can it also educate us? Of course, yes. I would like to show you why and how it educates us for three reasons. The first reason is that there are a lot of broadcasters which offer several kinds of educational programs. Some are for kids, some are for teenagers, and the others are for adults. We can learn a lot of things from these programs. The second is that it is a good opportunity for us to watch TV programs in order to cultivate our media literacy. Unfortunately, you can find that there are horrible shows that are completely useless for the education of your kids. However, you and your kids could learn which programs are good or bad by choosing them yourself. The third reason why and how television educates us is that watching TV shows really helps you learn languages. For those reasons, I think that television can educate us.

A zoo is where animals from around the world are kept on display for people. Animals in a zoo live in a cage that is built imitating their normal habitat to reduce their stress, however, it cannot entirely replace the real habitat in nature. In my opinion, people should not study animals that are kept in zoos for these reasons. First, when animals are raised in zoos, they change their behaviour to adjust to the new environment. They would normally hunt their prey or protect themselves from predators, but zoos provide them with enough foods and safe places to live in comfort. For example, penguins are waiting for a zookeeper to be fed and tigers don't hunt anymore. Moreover, zoos keep each animal separately depending on its species. Therefore, there is no interaction between different species. In nature, animals of each species would form a food chain to control each other's population, which cannot be formed in a zoo environment. In conclusion, it is best to have animals roaming free. A zoo is not a proper place for learning about animals.

Furthermore, students who have graduated from high school tend to be accepted into that country's university more. They can adapt to their new environment and friends more easily than students who never studied abroad. On the other hand, studying abroad requires a bigger budget for living and school expenses even if students get a scholarship. Moreover, some universities do not accept a foreign student in the same course as their country's local students because of the language barrier. So, when students come back to their home country, some of them don't meet a job's knowledge requirements or lack the experience of working for a local company. Therefore, every student should think carefully before they apply to a university abroad so that they will get more good experiences than disadvantages.

Travel in the future might be totally different from travel now. We have to go somewhere when travelling, but we won't have to go anywhere in the future, we just use the internet for virtual travelling. We have recently started to use virtual reality. In this COVID-19 situation, most of us have started to use web conference systems both for jobs and privately. We don't have to travel to meet with somebody. We can connect with them online. We can visit anywhere all over the world in virtual reality systems with specific goggles. Someone might say the following: "We can't taste local foods unless we go there. We can't smell something in the distance. We can't feel the temperature and humidity of some places." But digital technology will improve rapidly. I believe we can get these feeling via the internet and we can get magnificent experiences using virtual reality as we travel there. This story seems to be a dream. But we didn't know about the COVID-19 situation one year ago. We don't know how the world will change in the future and we look forward to the unbelievable travel experiences.

Volunteer work is of great importance for our community and we could not accomplish several aims without it. Therefore I personally rate the idea of requiring a specific amount of volunteer work in order to graduate really exquisit. Those activities obviously require a lot of time but every student can help our community by volunteering and as a side effect they do good and accordingly feel good as well. Working voluntarily is also helpful with forming your character: it makes you more confident and reliable after you have been given such great responsibilities. If you are used to working with volunteers you know that it is not always easy and sometimes devastating. Therefore, college students are prepared for complications in their later job by gaining those experiences. Furthermore universities often want to know your extra-curricular activities as they are often required for scholarships. Therefore pupils are automatically given a better chance of achieving them. In conclusion it is very honorable to do volunteer work and as many teenagers spend a lot of time inside, it would not hurt them at all to do so.

Medical doctors' workplace After some tough years of studying in order to become a reputable doctor that not only do they do in order to achieve a better status, but also to accomplish their wish to live a comfortable life, it is unlikely that a medical school graduate has have prospects about working in a deprived area. First and foremost, if the salary was equal for each and every health professional, no matter the place they choose to work in, they would be more willing to jeopardize their social life in order to work in much havier conditions and with poorly educated people. A respectable wage is a great motivation to balance this statistic. In addition to the aforementioned, the government should be looking deeply into introducing more privileges to those heroes. Some of the doctors are urged to get to people who are more isolated, which is a real challenge especially during cold seasons. Those doctors should be provided with transport in order to move around freely and also more furlough that will be beneficial for their mental and physical health. Moreover, they should get the best accommodation possible during their stay in the rural area in order to show how much we appreciate their daily efforts. To sum up, the sacrifices the doctors make being apart from their families and an active social life should be compensated with a more attractive wage and a generous place to stay.

The School of the Future I imagine what is going to happen to the schools in this country 10 years from now. Perhaps, some will be different, and some will still be the same. The most drastic change is the number of schools. A lot of schools will be closed due to the decline of the birthrate here. Schools will have to try hard to make kids enroll in them. We can imagine that it is very competitive. However, the competition may be a good opportunity for them because it will make the quality of their education and services much better to survive this. Another difference will be brought to the schools by the advancement of information technology, such as AI, machine learning, 5G, and so on. These technologies will change how to teach, how to learn, and communication between teacher and students, or among students. Teachers have to follow the change.

In March 2015, I visited my relatives in China with my mother. It was my first time seeing them so they were very happy to see me and welcomed us with a great party. I saw a different culture and lifestyle. They took me to a historical museum where I learnt more about the city's development and Chinese people's life in the past. Moreover, I went shopping in a shopping street and ate many delicious local foods and sweets, which I loved so much. However, people there spoke in local Chinese that I hardly understood and was almost unable to speak. It made me realize that I needed to learn about this language and practise using it more with my parents who were fluent in this language. That wonderful holiday was the best holiday of my life and I want to visit them again and spend more time there in the future.

There is no doubt about how exercise is important to our lives. Humans need energy and enough activity to burn it off to maintain a normal physiology. However, exercise is not the most important thing for our health. In fact, a human needs the 4 most important factors to survive, which are food, shelter, clothes, and medication. Also, our wellness is varied due to differences in these factors. We need food and water to build up energy and prevent a disease. Many kinds of food are considered as a medicine to reduce an inflammation or improve an immunity. There is a trend, nowadays, of eating 'clean food', believed to prevent a disease, as well as a trend of daily exercise. Some food is put into a 'junk food' category, which means it is bad for the health of a person who consumes it. In conclusion, exercise is important for our health, but there are many things that are more important than that. Therefore, we need to focus not only on exercising but also on other things to maintain our good health.

Hi George, How are you doing? I hope you are fine. I am writing to you to tell you about the concert at which I was last Friday. You probably do not know who performed. It was a famous Polish singer. His name is Krzysztof Zalewski. The concert took place in a big amphitheater in Katowice. You must see this place next time! I decided to go to this concert because I am a big fan of this singer and his music style. The concert was wonderful. The sound and lights were very good. The concert lasted for around two hours.

Should people always tell the truth? Or is it sometimes acceptable to tell a lie? The first thing we need do is to ask ourselves: Is it a moral question or a social one? To begin with, we are told since our childhood to never lie. We heard, "lying is a bad thing, and you will hurt people if you do so." And so, everyone grows up believing that a liar is a terrible person. So, if we are responding to this question from a moral point of view, I would say we should never lie. Nevertheless I believe it's more complicated than white or black. Sometimes grey is the best option, and it allows people to avoid conflicts. In my view, lying from time to time is acceptable if the purpose is noble. Sometimes a lie can be used to protect someone from being hurt and not the other way around. Actually, let's pick an example. Someone cheats on someone else. What is the best thing to do ? To tell the truth and destroy everything you built ? To lie and not hurting your loved one ? Of course, some people are just cowards. But it's a very difficult question to judge. Regardless this kind of interrogation, my opinion is to hide the truth if the purpose is to avoid hurting someone. Otherwise be bold and brave and speak your mind.

What is the future of travel? Will planes still be as numerous ? Will trains be able to run faster? Will there be flying cars? Or conversely, will there be no future of travel? At first sight, there is not a concrete answer. Nevertheless, if we look at the big picture we might find some responses. Not only new political ideas have emerged but people are more concerned than ever about ecology, the planet and its well-being. The travel business accounts for a major part of the pollution. And we also know that the earth can't take it anymore. In my view, we must stop travelling the way we do. As a matter of fact, many people have access to air travel. We might see this as an improvement. It is not. We have just increased the level of pollution. Twenty years from now, I believe car ownership will have drastically plunged. Public transportation will rise and develop. Finally, I trust air travel will only be used for business trips. To conclude, the future of travel needs to be more responsible and eco-friendly. It is our duty to be aware of what is coming.

There is no doubt that these days health is one of the significant things people around the world are talking about. The question is, which is more useful, to be healthy or rich? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of the positive side, people say wellness is the most important thing for anyone to live their life. The main reason they give to support this idea is that if you feel tired, you will miss your energy. To illustrate that, without health you could not be successful in your career. In other words, health can let you improve your business and provide a bright future. However, other people say money could become every things even comfortable life. Firstly, with money we can go to the proficinal hospital and get treatment. Secondly, it bring happiness because it provides facilities which make life easier. In conclusion, some people say health is the important thing we should keep it at our bodies, but others say health is the important thing we should keep it at our bodies, but others say health could become every things even health. Therefore, I believe that both of them are necessary for humans, but health comes first all the time.

University life University is the broad between adolescence and adulthood. It is up to each young person how steep is going to be his maturity is going to be. Even though most high school graduates are urged to leave home in order to get a chance for a top higher education, I do not see this compromise as a detrimental factor for their future. First and foremost, independence is a crucial life skill that should be gained as soon as possible. If a university student chose to stay at home until he graduated, he would be unlikely to move away when getting employed. This type of young people not only will never grow up into adults, but they will certainly not start a family in the near future. For instance, students who live on their own are thrifty and are able to keep track of their expenses. Moreover, they gained other essential life skills such as how to cook and how to benefit in order to prepare a meal from scratch. In addition to the aforementioned, people who lived online during their college years are more employable, as they have experience with getting along easily with people and are brilliant problem - solvers. All the struggle with figuring out how to survive with pocket money due to a dull part-time job and a tumultuous day-to-day life with their roommates paid off. To sum up, students who move away from home will benefit the most from the college years, as they will take their life into their hands and develop themselves well enough in order to become successful adults.

I think that music is great. Music can help people to relax, it's good for your brain and also for your mind. Depending on the type of music the effect can be different. Some people like to listen to relaxing music, some people like to listen to rock music or other types of music. I think that all students should practice music in their schools. That is why I think all students should study music. I remember that when I was a little boy I studied music and I was pretty good at doing it. I went to the president of Romania with my musical team and we visited the building that is named "Cotroceni." I remember that the president in that period was Ion Iliescu, the ball boy of Ceausescu.

Living healthily requires sacrifice, determination, and concentration. From the outside, it could seem the simplest thing in the world, but on the inside the truth comes out. Healthy habits are very difficult to follow and acquire. The experts tell us that we should eat vegetables and fruits, perhaps coming from organic crops, but then we see them sponsoring MacDonald's. They bend their knees in front of money and so do we, normal people, who have to deal with real life problems. Buying vegetables from a farmer would be amazing, if the costs were affordable. Junk food and snacks are a great deal cheaper than healthy food and also more tempting. Although exercise is certainly fundamental for healthy living, I strongly believe that eating good products is what really makes the difference. In order to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for food, vegetables, fruits, and animals are bombarded with chemicals, hormones, and antibodies, to make them grow more quickly. This causes significant damage both to our body and to our digestive system. In addition to that, our lives have become more sedentary, so we don't burn all the calories we eat, and more stressful, so we eat more to find consolation in food.

Teaching is an important job. Teachers are people who contribute significantly to the development of students. Some people think that it is beneficial for students to have the same teacher for many years, while others believe students will learn a lot more when they have different teachers. In my opinion, it will be better when students can learn from a variety of teachers because each teacher has his/her talent and method in teaching, which directly affects the students' ability. The same teacher year after year can make students feel bored. When they are bored, students lose their interest in the lessons which affects their understanding and learning ability. As a result, students could not absorb the new knowledge and might lose their interest in going to school. Besides, if the teacher is responsible for all subjects over the years, their knowledge about the subject might not be well-researched because there are a lot of things to learn. Furthermore, lessons might not be well-prepared if the teacher teaches many subjects for many years. On the other hand, students will benefit more from having different teachers each year. Each teacher has their talent and will be professional in some specific fields. Learning with these teachers helps students learn completely new things and they can be taught in some of the most understandable ways because teachers only need to focus on a very limited number of subjects and students. In conclusion, changing teachers every year will benefit students since they can learn comprehensively from many different teachers over the years. Eventually, students will develop and acquire their knowledge to become good people.

Two people can communicate with each other only if they speak a common language. Speaking more than one language is always a benefit. This essay contains some of my viewpoints: in addition to everyone's first language, it is also important to learn a foreign one, why this is becoming increasingly necessary, and its advantages. Firstly, being fluent in the same language permits two different people to know each other through chatting . You are able to make friends with everybody in your country, where all people understand perfectly what you say. But the situation will be changed if you go abroad without learning a foreign language. In that case, you will have difficulty communicating with them, as well as them with you. Thanks to the development of trains and airplanes, everybody can travel far away from where they live . So , in order to be in contact with someone who comes from a different place, the knowledge of that person's language is essential. Well, learning a second language enables you to travel to another nation without communication problems and to chat and discuss things with a foreigner. To sum up , in my personal opinion, people have more and more necessity to know at least a second language. Nowadays, we travel more often than in the past, for that reason we are usually in contact with people with a different culture. So , studying a foreign way of speaking is very important.

Nowadays it is undeniable that volunteer work is a useful action at the same time as a helpful job. Furthermore thousands of people need a volunteer's hand to have a better life, for example with school work or money problems. Firstly, it is true that students must learn about great actions, since they prepare them for real life and they learn to be concerned for poor people, furthermore ecosystems and their country's economy and politics. Secondly, as an opposite argument, university access has been obstructed for many years for especially though exams. If a school council adds a new obligatory activity, such as volunteer work, knowing high school learners have to prepare their future studying very hard, it could be very stressful for them to pass the year through a complementary activity. Finally, volunteer work is for qualifying people in many subjects and moreover for people who are going to do their best and enjoy it. I genuinely think that only volunteers are the people who can do those activities, so it is terrific to include them in a school program, although it must be optional, do not stress busy students.

A majority of people consider that doing exercise is important for their health and they are not wrong. However, there are other things which are as important as or more important than exercising. Firstly, you should eat a healthy diet. This means eating a variety of food poor in fats and sugar. Someone's diet is very important if they want to live healthily. Although a little junk food, rich in fats and sugar, from time to time does not hurt anybody, it should be eaten as rarely as possible because the carbohydrates affect the proper functioning of the human body. Secondly, it is also important to have an organised lifestyle, with eight hours of sleep and eating regularly. The more organised someone's life is, the healthier he is because, with a routine, the body gets used to working normally and efficiently. Moreover, it has been scientifically proved that emotions have a lot to do with people's health. For example, stress affects someone's liver while sadness affects humans' lungs and so on. So being happy and thinking positively also contributes to people's health. That is why it is important to be pleased with the things you do. In my view, exercise is important for our health, but it is not the most important thing. If you are too busy or tired after a day at work it is not necessary to exhaust yourself exercising, instead you could do something that relaxes you and makes you happy.

Studying abroad is a great experience for everyone. However, as all choices that are made in life, there are advantages and disadvantages. When students are looking for a country to study in, several times they are focusing on the cultural diversity or thinking about the beautiful places they can visit. Obviously, this thought isn't wrong, but the truth is that they won't live just fun moments in the chosen country. A lot of problems can appear throughout the journey and the students will have to cope without their parents, which can be the first time that it happens. For example, the students maybe won't adapt to their new friends or they can find a lot of difficulty with the language, because in most cases, the students go abroad thinking that they can speak with natives, but when they have their first conversation, it doesn't work like it worked in their imagination. On the other hand, there are a lot of advantages that the new country can offer. This experience can be the first time that the students need to organize their freedom, because until this moment, they have always had their routine planned by parents. Furthermore, they will meet new people from different places around the world, and making connections with them will be an amazing experience in their life.

Moreover, Write and Improve is online practice and it is compatible with every device, like computers, tablets, and mobile phones so that everyone can access it anywhere that they want. I really like Write and Improve because I have to find out my mistakes by myself, which is really fun for me.

Write and Improve is an English site on the internet where everyone can practise and improve their writing skills. I first heard of this site from my English teacher when she was trying to convince me and my classmates to write with more confidence in English. I must admit that I was not sure about it at first. All of this because I didn't consider myself very keen on writing, especially in a language other than my native one. Although I was sceptic about this, I decided to give it a try. At first, I was surprised by the variety of types of exercises which I could find on Write and Improve. I hadn't expected it. It was not difficult to choose a task which inspired me to write. I was fascinated. Once I had started I could not stop, but I had to owing to the limited number of words because this site also helps you to decide how much you should write for every task. Moreover, after you finish you can press on the Check button and the site will automatically verify and mark your work. All things considered, I would certainly recommend Write and Improve, not only to anyone who wants to improve their writing skills but also to those who write only for fun. The site is well structured and offers a variety of tasks from which to choose the one which inspires you most.

Studying music Nowadays music is everywhere around us. Music not only drives people a pleasant vibe, but it also takes part in inducing concentration. Music used to be very well appreciated in the aristocratic society and if the children mastered a musical instrument it brought a distinctive honour to the family, being a trace of a high-chosen education and wealth. Why shouldn't it still be a mandatory subject at school? Music is a very fine science, as it develops the cognitive abilities. Children will develop an inner intelligence and a stronger sense of responsibility. It is proven that if a child takes up a musical instrument at an early age, he will get more shots at a tremendous growth. Studying music tenders an auspicious behaviour and elegance in gestures, essential for a young person who is looking forward to be part of a diplomatic circle and to gain a reputable status in society. It is also well known that music offers a wide range of tremendous knowledge. For instance, it is a smooth alternation of to mathematics and physics, as it teaches measurements and also the power and the fluctuation of the sound. As a result, it may be an excellent practical application of those school subjects, representing an entertaining way to understand them. To sum up, I do not see how studying music would be detrimental to a young man's development, as it plays a beneficial role in gaining the skills necessary to become a respectable adult.

My favourite season of the year Every season is more wonderful than the others, but each one is special in its own particular way. From the lively spring to the cold wet winter, I like every one of them because I am looking forward to seeing how mother earth changes every year. However, I do have one favourite season and that is winter. In my country, in winter time, the temperatures are usually below 0 degrees. The weather is wet and it is snowing a lot. Sometimes, the layer of snow can reach a height of two meters. The sun is not as bright as it is in summer, therefore there is not much light either. Also, the sun sets earlier, so the daytime is shorter than the nighttime. Despite all the things above, winter is still my favourite season of the whole year. Mostly because I love the cold, but I think I can dare to say that even a human being who doesn't like it could enjoy winter. In this season there are a lot of festivities and celebrations. For example, on the first of December it is Romania's National Day, Christmas is also celebrated in winter time, the New Year, Valentine's Day, and a lot of other lovely days. However, being out while it is snowing and trying to catch a snowflake with your tongue or in your hand compares with nothing else. All in all, these are the majority of reasons why I consider winter is the best season of the whole year. But, of course, Christmas movies, which I adore, could have contributed a little to this.

Some students choose to study in a foreign country while they are still in high school or at university. To start with, we will speak about the advantages of studying abroad. Then we will bring attention to the disadvantages. Finally, I will give you my personal opinion on the matter. First and foremost, there are a lot of advantages for students who study in another country for a while. As a matter of fact, they will discover a lot of things, such as new cultures, new habits, and new people. Some of them will learn a new language, such as French, English, Spanish, or even Chinese. The skills they will develop abroad will be a great help for later. Furthermore, students who are studying abroad will become more independent from their parents and family. Last but not least, they will have an incredible experience that will remain for the rest of their lives. At first sight, it seems there are no disadvantages of studying in a foreign country. That's not true. Some students might feel disoriented. Young students in particular when they are far from their parents. To some extent the young ones might find it difficult to fit in in another country. For instance, they can be disturbed by the local food or by the fact that they can't communicate easily. In my view, studying abroad is a personal choice, and it depends on your attitude. On the one hand, some people aren't meant to travel the world. They feel more comfortable at home. On the other hand, some are driven by the need to discover new cultures. They need to live wildly. To sum up, there are great advantages to studying abroad for a while during high school or university. But not everyone is suited for it.

A long life Nowadays we live in a world of teribilism and unconscience. There are fewer wise people than there used to be. Life is the most precious gift that can be received and I believe that it should be lived to the fullest, but taken in abstemious shots. First and foremost, life is more enjoyable when you enjoy each and every small moment of happiness it offers. It is proven that if we live our life sober, we are more likely to live longer and to get more time to have it all. A life spent in peace and in harmony is something that many wish for, but few people actually achieve this spiritual fulfilment. If you had a lovely family and a decent income, why would you work your fingers to the bone for more revenue? Money cannot buy joy. In addition to the aforementioned, an intense life is a tumultuous life that is very likely to end earlier and worse. For instance, it is a pity how many rebellious young people die in car crashes due to their love for high speeds. Moreover, an exhausting career and countless white nights will be detrimental to one's health and will only bring pain and suffering. Life is more precious than to be lived like that. Consequently, a busy schedule also neglects the family, like tremendous moments that are irreversible. To sum up, the biggest achievement in life is to be at peace at the end of it, build memories to be remembered and to avoid as much as possible the self-harm caused by vices.

Learning a new language today is not as important as it was years ago. The main reason is that rich and important people had the opportunity to study that language. There were also few people who spoke different languages. Today, it is different, every one of us can learn a foreign language. Sometimes we need to learn it because today there are a lot of jobs and people who require a knowledge of the language. There are a lot of different people in the world and this allows us to speak another language to be understood by people from another country. This opens a lot of paths for you. You can do a job that a person who does not have the knowledge cannot do, or you could simply say " I can speak another language." That is a good thing. I think this is the main difference between the past and the present.

Today is my first day of a new year of school. Today, my teacher asked me to write what I would like to achieve this year. Let's start with the subjects where I think I am doing well. The first one is maths. I am a genius because of my teacher, and my marks show this. The second one I like is history. It is one of my favourite subjects thanks to our teacher, a very funny and professional historian. Now, on the other hand there are a few subjects where I have a lot of difficulties and I need to improve in them. For example, the worst marks I have are for Chinese. In fact, my teacher is still trying to improve my level of the language. I am not interested in Chinese, but I need to get good marks or I could fail it, and I really do not want to. Another difficult area where I have low marks is English literature because I deeply hate the various poems, novels, and so on. I need to get better in these two areas, and to do this I must study them. In Chinese I need to add watching series with subtitles to the list. I hope I will improve.

Nowadays, speaking English is the most valuable skill. With this language we can talk with people from all over the world. However, everybody has a different reason for learning English. Personally, to me the most meaningful thing about learning English is the fact that I want to teach English too. My dream is to teach English to children in kindergarten, actually. Hence, I have an incredible motivation for learning. In that case, I believe that I have to know English very well if I want to teach others. Due to that, I improve my English every day by watching English movies, reading English books, etc. Another important reason is that I want to move to Australia in the future. So, as I wrote previously, I have to know English properly. I even started watching historical movies about Australia. To my mind, it is important to know something about a county in which I want to live. So, as you see, learning English is extremely important in my life. I connect my future with that language, obviously. So it's really meaningful for me to learn English and know it well.

Regarding the recent discussion about the suggestion to force children to do sporting activities at least three times per week, I decided to list my arguments for each side. This could help me to conclude which side of the argumentation I agree with. Based on several studies which prove that activities can improve the health constitution of children, many teachers and scientists propose more physical education for children. Further research has also shown the obesity rate of children is increasing. This problem might be dealt with by forcing children to do more sport. In return this could help them to lose weight, but also to gain an interest in sports. Without being forced to do sport these children might have never discovered their interest and as a result more young people will enter a sports team to pursue the desire of sport. But of course there are also other arguments which refute this idea. The main contradiction for many people is the idea of forcing children. Compulsion can never be a useful way to convince children, who need to be taught the valuable good of liberty. Even our constitution enshrines the moral value of freedom. Therefore children cannot be forced to do more sport only due to the fact this will improve their health. As humans are not allowed to constrain each other, everyone needs to discover the importance of sport for himself. Furthermore experts are afraid of the mental consequences for children, who were forced to do sports although they avoided it previously. There is a variety of reasons why children are not confident with their body such as the shame of obesity. In conclusion I would recommend the executives to avoid forcing children to to anything as this will only cause more harm. Of course sport is really important as it can improve the fitness, but this needs to be something the children decide for because they appreciate it.

Telling the truth Nowadays honesty is a character trait that is about to become extinct, as it is more and more difficult to find people you can trust and we are around people who are pursuing their own interest. I believe in being faithful in crucial moments., but there are some times when truth should be covered. First and foremost, sometimes the truth can be unimaginably painful and it is best to protect the vulnerable ones, especially if they have a weak heart. For instance, if an elderly person didn't know about one of their children's illness or worse, of an eventual death, they would not have a premature end caused by depression or other conditions, as we never know how they would react to eventful times. On the contrary, in good times old people value honesty and feel disrespected if someone tells them white lies. In addition to the aforementioned, it is well known that a child should be raised a man of his word and learn about loyalty to others. But, there are times when avoiding the truth may save relationships. As a relevant example, when a child does not mention his fights he had at school without anyone getting harmed, his mother will not punish him from drawing until midnight and will not compromise his will to pursue this passions. Moreover, the atmosphere in their home will be furthermore pleasant and loving, advisable for a child to grow up naturally. To sum up, I believe that being honest is a rare gem that should be appreciated more in others, but it should also be taken into consideration the eventuality of hurting others by making them face the cruel truth.

Dear Billal, How are you ? I am in a great shape ! I want to tell you about my last week, it was one of my best experiences. I am just back from an amazing trip with some students from my class. First and foremost, I discovered we have stunning places just near to our place. We were in the countryside of Masillia. It's called the Verdon. Do you know about it ? There are large rivers and authentic houses. At first sight, it doesn't seem so exciting. Rather the opposite, for crying out loud ! We visited some caves that you can only be joined with a kayak. My arms were tired but the landscape's view was worth any effort. Moreover, I got to know the other students and they were very kind and nice. I enjoyed this trip because everything was just perfect, from the places we had been to the people I had to spend time with. Furthermore, we played a lot of games, and you know how much I love that. In the future, I hope we will have the opportunity to travel together soon enough ! Looking forward to seeing you ! Best regards, Lola

I guess it is very important to have a life period as a volunteer worker. In my opinion, all the schools and universities should create a requirement in this way. First of all, it is good for the society, for people that can be helped in a volunteer program. Second, a person who works as a volunteer will increase their value, as a good person, a great man or woman. Third, a young person will be interested in being helpful, to work, to help someone, and it will prepare him for the job market, for a job, to work in a group with a goal, to have a personal objective. The volunteer work can be especially important if you can work with different people, for different people, maybe in a different country, in a different society. It will be a cultural trip, a humanity trip and you will become a better person for the rest of your life.

In my opinion, there are two sides to video games and their impact on young people. Playing video games has some positive effects on children. First of all, it improves their reflexes and concentration. It may help them in the future with other actions in real life. For example, in some sports reflexes are very important to win games or fights. I see also another positive effect of video games, especially nowadays where a huge part of communication takes place on the Internet, children can talk to each other while playing video games. On the other hand, I see many negative effects of video games. First of all, playing for many hours every day makes children obese and damages their vision and backbone because they are, of course, sitting during that time. Because of that they do not play any sport or anything like that. They can't talk in real life and in adult life they have a problem with communication and things like that.

Good morning, I am writing about the case of your future decision about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In my opinion, a decision like this is too restrictive for people living in our town. I think this decision is also bad for many reasons. First of all, especially nowadays mobile phones are not only used for calling and messaging. For many people a mobile phone is used as a calendar, notebook, calculator and stuff like that. Thanks to the Internet they can also check, for example, bus departures or shop opening hours. On public transport people like to relax and do things which can help them to kill the time. In their mobile phone they can read news, listen to music, read books, play video games and many other things. So that is the next good example in my opinion. Let's see the shops. There are many reasons why you need to use your mobile phone there. Many people have a shopping list in their mobile phones. If you do not have the shopping list you may forget something. If you forget something you have to maybe call somebody to remind you about it. The next place is a restaurant. I think there using a mobile phone is not necessary but there is a group of people who need to be always in touch. I think my arguments are strong and you will change your decision quickly. Best regards. Pat

Living is a privilege not everyone is completely aware of, in spite of this awareness, everyone wants to live to the fullest. The question is, what way is the right way to live your life? Therefore, the next question arises: a long life until 100 years old or a shorter life but much more intense? For me the answer is obvious, as I chose my goals from very early on. I want to achieve something that stays after I no longer live. Subsequently the more time I have, the higher is the chance of accomplishing it. 100 years is a tremendously long period of time and the chances of getting ill at some point are comparatively high, so you should always treat your body the best possible way. You can, subsequently, use those years effectively for accomplishing your goals. Another reason for choosing the longer period of time, is the history you have, as nearly no one gets that old, you have a lot to tell and to experience in the first place, of course. Imagine what genuinely wonderful experiences you can gain in this long period of time. There, indeed, could not be anything more fulfilling than love. Moreover, exquisite things are to be explored, memories to be made and stories to be told. In conclusion, regard the shorter life, there are reasons for choosing this one two, but those for the longer one overweight by far.

Which is better for students, to have the same teacher for several years or to have new teachers each year? This question has sometimes been debated by people who are involved in education. Both situations have benefits, but I believe that it is good for almost all students to have new teachers each year. In real life, we meet a lot of different people, and they have a variety of backgrounds. Children have to learn about dealing with different people through school life. Having new teachers each year can help students learn about dealing with unfamiliar people and handling change. Hiroki Murakami, who is my coworker, was born in the countryside, and there was only one small elementary school where the number of teachers was limited. Therefore, he never experienced changing teachers in elementary school. After entering middle school, he experienced having new teachers each year. He said that it was frustrating at first because he had to remember the new teachers' characters and their routines, but he learned about dealing with new people through that experience. His world might be a smaller one if he had not experienced it. Having new teachers each year has more benefits, it brings you into contact with various ideas from different people. It is comfortable to spend time with the same people, such as family friends and adults who you like. It sometimes leads to reducing your world to a small society. Getting new teachers can help students get into contact with new ideas and broaden their world. Students can learn how to deal with others in a community by going to school. Having many teachers can help them experience how to develop flexibility with others and changes. Therefore, it is useful for them to have new teachers every year.

Now I still have mistakes, but it is a little from the beginning. I heard about this site from an influencer on YouTube. I surely know Cambridge University and this website. I have used it to see the definition of words. When I was young I used to write a paragraph twice or more per week. From the age of 16 till 19, I stopped this thing.

Many problems are related to doctors and healthcare. But this problem is not just about the doctors, because it includes many other jobs. People in general want to work in the bigger cities not just because of the money but also because there are many opportunities which are not in the villages or rural areas. For instance in the Czech republic there is a lack of doctors in these places even when the doctors could get bigger salary there. It is, in my opinion, about the lucrative living in the city. Even if there were more money in those areas the doctors would not go there. And in the big hospitals you can see much more interesting medical cases than anywhere else. The solution to this problem is hard to find but I would say that there are two things which could make this situation much better. The first thing is to speak with the young doctors and try to convince them that living in rural areas has a good sight. The other solution could be building small hospitals in those areas and try to get the doctors there. It would surely help everyone because it is better to have a good network of healthcare in your country for every patient.

School is a place where kids can learn new concepts, make new friends, fall in love, find their calling, and I'm positive that there must be even more possibilities and opportunities for them to gain while they are considered to be enrolled in one of these institutions. However, modern schools are bombarded with lots of criticism and nasty remarks. People don't like how children are being taught. Instead of teaching them by showing them how something works, teachers choose to expect their students to know only theory, and the best part is that committing a mistake is something that is regarded as a stupidity. But to be honest, all of us know that making mistakes enables us to learn new things better because we are aware of what we've done wrong. But let's move on to talking about how schools will be different in the future. So, in my opinion they're gonna be more about teaching kids by practicing a given skill. Lessons will be filled with various experiments and mistakes are going to be thought of as priceless opportunities to sharpen your knowledge. I'm sure that classes are gonna be much more smaller, because as we all well know, it's difficult to teach a group of 30 kids on your own without aid of any kind. It all sounds magical and almost unrealistic, but let's not get so cozy with this thought. Schools cannot change completely, there are some aspects that are irrevocable. For example, there is a huge possibility that children will still have to study until they reach the age of 18. It doesn't sound that awful, does it? Well no, but some kids could move at a much quicker pace and by setting this bar so high, we only slow them down. There still will be teachers who hate their jobs and try to make their pupils' lives miserable. I'm sorry that it was a wrong choice, but it doesn't give you any permission to hurt innocent children with your harsh comments and your general gloomy existence which doesn't motivate them to even come to school in the first place!

Dear council, Your latest idea of banning mobile phones in public areas has caused many discussions. Many people , including me, are worried to miss important messages or calls. Especially if your bus is running late and you have no chance to inform your waiting friends, because it is not allowed to take out the phone in public transport. Many of our citizens have a very busy workday and need their lunchbreak to make a phone call. This would not be possible, if they were in a restaurant or the bus. I do also love to sit in a local cafe and have a phone call with my family members who I cannot see every day. However, I do really like the idea of putting my phone away when I meet friends for dinner. Me and everyone else should be encouraged to talk face to face with others while having a meal in our local restaurants. My solution would be to still allow mobile phones in public transport and shops. People want to be up to date and chat with others while they take their tram home. What we could try is to ban mobile phones in restaurants and bars. It would be amazing to see how groups of people start to talk more and make new friends. There is always to chance to go outside to quickly call a friend, if it is really urgent.

I would like to say that the volunteer work is really helpful and people should do it in general. The important question is whether the schools should require it from their students. To put it another way, this work is called volunteer work which means that the people should not be forced to do it. In other words, the students should decide themselves whether they want to help someone without pressure from the school. In my opinion, people who are forced to do something are not really happy and they don't do it properly. I am convinced that the schools should support their students to participate in these types of volunteer work and they should probably have some benefits for the students who actually do that. All things considered, the students shouldn't be forced to do any kind of work. However, they should be supported in every helpful activity which they decide to do.

Working in an office means, for most people, stability. This is certainly due to defined working hours and to a long - term planning of activities, both personal and of the workteam, both on the workteam, both on the side, such as the projects to be completed, and on the private side, such as the vacation period. Moreover, a work office offers the chance to have a personal space which no one else is allowed to touch: a desk. Having a private desk, where we can organize documents and files as we think is best, can really make a difference to our productivity. However, there are many different types of desks. In some offices, employees work in cubicles, with empty walls and no possibility of personalizing their workstations, neither by attaching photos to the walls nor by placing small plants on their desks. This denied personalization could have negative effects on employee productivity: they are supposed to spend all their work time sitting alone, in front of the computer, avoiding any human interaction. In this way workers are isolated from each other and can neither exchange their ideas nor have a word to break the routine. On the contrary, an open space allows employees to talk to each other and to act like a group, escaping the isolation cubicles would force them into. In this way, the job gets to be more dynamic and ideas can develop easier. If workers had the opportunity to personalize their desks too, their productivity would be, without any doubt, much greater, because they would work in a place where they feel at home.

Dear Sir or Madam of our town council, I am writing to you this letter regarding your idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport. I am a citizen of the city and would like to tell you my opinion about this issue. First of all, I would like to tell you that I may understand why you want to ban the mobile phones. A lot of accidents, which have happened, happened because people have used their mobile phones in the traffic and, for sure, that is dangerous. In accordance with the number of accidents, I would counsel you to ban it. Nevertheless we cannot disregard other aspects. As you know, mobile phones have become pretty important in the last decade. There is a great digitalization and meanwhile you could do almost everything on the internet. Do not forget that there are people who buy their tickets in an online shop. These tickets are not printed. At least in that part mobile phones are not only useful but necessary. Moreover, a lot of people listen to music during the wait-time for their transport or in the transport. As I said in the beginning, it may be dangerous but I think instead of banning mobile phones, it might be better to invest in warnings because through banning you limit the freedom of the people. It is the same in restaurants and shops. It is a restriction which is not necessary and will annoy people. So I would like to ask that you just leave it. Kind regards, Anna

Globalization has, as an inevitable consequence, an increase of the population in the cities - especially in the city centres - and a decrease of the number of people who live in rural areas. These two factors inevitably led to a greater concentration of the services - including those considered basic necessities - in the cities. As always happens, everyone has taken advantage of this to their advantage, even doctors, who are supposed to be charitable and selfless people. Conversely, most of them have revealed to be much more interested in money and success than in people's health. First of all, doctors shouldn't be allowed to earn all the money they earn, because they are supposed to do their job because of a vocation they have inside them. Secondly, they shouldn't be allowed to have three, four or five jobs in different structures, a solution which would also solve part of the disocupation problem. Third, they shouldn't be able to make private visits in public hospital. Here, in Italy, this process is called "intramenia." On the other hand, the problem of fewer and fewer people in rural zones should be solved with restocking campaigns. It's obvious that in a village with three or four inhabitants a doctor can't stay everyday: it would be a waste of public money, which we really need to save and spend accurately.

I like going to the gym. Why? Because it makes me healthier and helps me have a toned body. Over 3 years ago, I was 1.83 meters tall and only 58 kilos. People said that I looked so thin. After that, I went to the gym every day and about 6 months later, my weight improved significantly. I was still 1.83 meters tall but 65 kilos. I kept going to the gym from then until now. At present, I am 76 kilos. A significant change, right? Oh, about the last question, I last did it this morning.

I use a computer every day. I use it for many purposes: to relax, to watch movies, to play games and to listen to music. What do I enjoy doing most with a computer? Well, if it was a few years ago, I would say I liked playing games most. But now, what I love doing most with a computer is learning. Sounds hard to believe but it's true. Yeah! I've almost completely lost interest in games.

To begin with, zoos have become very popular these last few decades. They allow people to learn about animals. It is a popular place for families to spend some quality time. However, some people believe it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. In the first place, I will tell you why zoos are important. Then, I will explain why I believe zoos are not good for animals. Finally, I will give you my opinion about the future. To start with, zoos are not only created in order to entertain people. As a matter of fact, most zoos help to prevent the extinction of endangered species. For instance, just a few black pandas still live in the wild, so zoos have the duty to develop the panda population. How sad it would be if pandas disappeared, for crying out loud! Of course, humans are responsible for animals disappearing, but some zoos are trying to make it better. Furthermore, zoos allow people to discover animals and to learn more about them. In this way, I trust zoos are good places. On the other hand, I believe zoos are terrible for the animals' health. I believe, it is wrong to keep a wild animal locked up inside a small square. As an example, tigers need to run one hundred miles a day. How is this possible in a zoo? Moreover, I think animals in zoos are unhappy and some might even suffer from depression. In my view, zoos are a dangerous place for animals and their well-being. Unfortunately, it has become urgent to increase the population of endangered species and nowadays, only zoos are able to prevent some mass extinction. In the future, I hope we will find a way to live peacefully without destroying animals' homes.

Music is a part of art and I believe that all people should know some basics about music. The important question is whether it should be taught in schools. Firstly, music is part of our lives. We are in touch with music every day in movies, shows, many people listen to music in their free time and some people go to concerts. If music is really that important in our culture we all ought to know something about it. Secondly, music is also important for our thinking and mindset. On the other hand, there are people who do not like music at all and they are bad at it. For example one of my friends was forced to play piano and he didn't like it at all. All things considered, it seems to me that the students should be educated in the theory of music but they shouldn't be forced to play any musical instrument.

My reasons for learning English There are many reasons to learn English, and everyone might have a different point of view. To begin with, I will give you the reasons that led me to learn English a few years ago. Additionally, I will tell you why it matters to me. To start with, I wasn't very interested in learning English when I was younger. I believed it was useless. At the age of fifteen I changed my mind, crying out loud! The main reason to learn English was to be able to watch American movies in their original version. As a matter of fact, I was a huge fan of Buffy, the vampire slayer and it was important for me to hear their voices without dubbing. Of course, I used subtitles. Furthermore, when I went to college, I had to take English classes. It made me understand how necessary it was to improve my writing and speaking ability. Not only to be able to graduate but also because a lot of companies value it. Last but not least, I love to travel, and I am very interested in learning about other countries. To speak English offers me the opportunity to communicate easily with foreigners.

Today, knowing English is crucial for any worker. So that's why I am studying English. All articles and manuals are in English. Some of them are in my native language. Because of globalization, we need to work with foreign professionals. So how are we going to communicate if we don't speak English. Many times they aren't native English speakers, many of them are Chinese, German, or Spanish, so it's important to have a language in common. This language is English. If I am not wrong, there are more English speaker who are non-native than native English speakers. Of course, if you work in some rare areas where other languages are not important, then it's not important to learn. But if you are in this situation and like to travel abroad, then knowing English is very important. Travel agencies always have instructions in English. So if you wouldn't like to stay behind, study English!

Hello Anna, How are you doing! Five days ago, I went to an absolutely incredible concert. It was really mind-blowing to listen to the six musicians, see all the other people around me, and last but not least, the awesome fireworks at the beginning and at the end of the concert. Since I was a teenager I've dreamed of going to another concert of the Scorpions. Yes, this wonderful German rock group that plays songs in German and in English. Despite the fact that I didn't get some of the English songs, it was a pretty amazing night. If I had learnt more English vocabulary, I would have understood more. Because of this, I must learn more and improve my knowledge of your mother tongue even further. Maybe you can continue to give me some advice. Kind regards,

Hi friend! How are things? Sorry to be so slow getting back to you, but as I told you some weeks ago, I went to an incredible concert in the city next to mine. I'm glad that you dropped me a line. So, in your letter you wondered how that came about. Well, my girlfriend's really keen on music, so she persuaded me to go with her to a concert that was taking place in the city next to ours, and although I had to work that day, I couldn't call it off because she already bought the tickets. She's infatuated with a Latin singer called Bad Bunny and when she heard about the concert, she freaked out. I'm not fond of Spanish music, though in spite of that, I enjoyed the concert pretty much. The atmosphere was really cozy and cool, there were a lot fewer people than I expected, so it wasn't too crowded, which was something I felt really thankful for. And despite the event lasting 3 hours, surprisingly, I ended up singing and dancing as if that was our last day on earth. The guy performing was wearing flashy fashionable clothes so it wasn't easy to lose him. Well, that was all for now. I'm looking forward to hearing about your weekend. Best wishes, Ale

It goes without saying that the use of cell phones is common enough nowadays, after all, we watch films, series, read newspapers and books, seeing that this is a great way to connect with the breaking news. However, there is an addiction to mobile phones these days, though the solution is not to ban this device. that measure is not going to reduce the problem of interaction between individuals, apart from interfering in humanitarian law, as it interferes with citizens' right to choose. Let us focus, firstly, on such an idea as to prohibit a mobile telephone, which can be seen as an answer to the question of social interaction in establishments such as restaurants, stores, or even in public transport. Although this notion is well accepted by the majority of people, it is incorrect, considering that this issue is multifactorial. Consequently, to ban only an idea will not settle the problem. A good illustration of this is to note that there is a huge diversity of relationships connected over the Internet. On the other hand, all people must have the right to take their own decisions and make their choices, forasmuch as a democratic country must not impose laws that interfere in the options of a population. In other words, it is crucial that citizens go to public places in the way that they have selected and with the devices that this individual considered the most appropriate. Nevertheless, I disagree with radical options for minor problems, since cell phones have more pros than cons and, therefore, it is better to have it than not to have it, only understanding that a phone allows contact with the world.

I think that telling a lie is a very big mistake. If you respect somebody you should tell him or her the truth, telling a lie is not going to solve your problems, sooner or later they will find out that you have lied and they will never trust you again. After telling a lie you are forced to tell another lie and another lie, until you start to believe your own lies. I don't like to lie to my son, wife or mother, it is not fair for anybody. I remember that sometimes my father was telling us lies and that was pretty obvious, when you are lying your body is still telling the truth. Grownups usually know when you are telling a lie, it is easier when you have to lie to your children or your grandfather in order to protect them, that is not a good strategy either. Children learn this way that it's right to tell a lie in order to get out of a difficult situation. I like and I search for people that don't tell lies, I want to be able to count on them and being a liar is not a person who I can trust. Regarding this subject I think that I have nothing else to add, I am looking forward to going to sleep.

If we want to discover what the future will be like, a good way to start this is by searching for the past. In the decade of the sixties, travelling around the world was a utopian dream. There were a few flights and they were very expensive. Therefore, having knowledge of the universal language (English) wasn't a common practice in schools around the world. However, with the power of globalization, travelling to several countries in one life became a possible dream. The amount of flights increased - side by side with the market demands - and the traveling culture spread as a new hobby and a synonym of happiness. Finally, we have arrived in the 21st century and we are wondering: in the next few years, will I be traveling more? Will it become cheaper? The answers, for me, are all "yes." In an increasingly connected world, the borders will decrease. On the other hand, I'm scared about the loss of culture shock between countries. First of all, we need put in our bags just the wills and leave at home the colonizing instinct that unfortunately still lives in our society.

When I was a child at school, during music classes, we learnt songs to sing at the end-of-year concert. It was fun, because our teachers taught us new words and ballets. When we grew up, sometimes we happened to sing musical songs, with solo parts. There were auditions to assign roles. Once I won and I became the protagonist. I was the happiest child in the world. When I was a girl, at the secondary school, during the music class we listened to classical music, as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach or Puccini, and we studied the history of operas, like Aida, the Traviata or the Turandot. We also studied how to play melodies on the flute, like "jingle bells" or "alleluia alleluia." Although studying music was fun when I was a child, when I grew up it became a complete waste of time. My teacher didn't take his job seriously and most of the time we wasted lessons talking about other things or studying other subjects. The hours used to study music can be useful when children are still little, because they need to have fun and to understand which are their interests. When children grow up, time should be spent in better ways. For example in schools the study of our Costituzione, whose articles should be known by every Italian citizen, could be introduced again or civic education, whose knowledge is really missing, because people have lost their good common sense. Moreover, geography could be developed, because people, especially the young ones, ignore what they are surrounded by. They don't know either that Rome is our capital, or that Pisa has the Leaning Tower, or that the Po, Arno and Tevere are our biggest rivers.

As far as I am concerned there is something essential about benevolent work at all. So as for me, it ought to be a part of the compulsory curriculum, an obligation to finish school and get the report. Some people could think it strange to force young pupils to go for something like that as a part of their education. But why not? Education isn't purely something professional, it should prepare youngsters not only for work to get good money but mainly to be a good person - sensitive and eager to support others. Unfortunately hospitals are crowded with suffering people waiting for someone to bring them relief. Moreover kennels are full of adorable animals craving for a warm smile. Places like that require some backing especially young, strong and healthy people who can provide those in need with their care and helping hand. If schools did something like that habitually they could contribute to students' personal and mental development. It could be quite educational as well as beneficial for their future life. For example, how to take care of ageing parents or be patient with children. Adulthood isn't only about making money and leading a luxury glamorous life. It also brings suffering, afflictions, misfortunes and hardship as well as responsibilities. The sooner young people understand that the better. An experience like that could not only evoke the drive to do something unselfish, but also encourage them to be diligent and make some sacrifices in order to make others happy, unpaid.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am Mike Smith, a citizen in this town. I would like to tell you my opinion about the idea of restriction of mobile phone usage in public spaces. In my opinion, it is not a good idea. If the usage were actually banned, it would result in being criticized by a lot of people. There are three reasons why I oppose this idea. First, we cannot respond to e-mails or phone calls quickly. Although some people have bad manners, it is too severe that you prohibit us from using phones in public places. Most of us usually interact with others anywhere. For example, I send an e-mail to my friends on the train when I make appointment with them. I have to tell them when I will arrive at the place where we gather. Moreover, when I receive e-mails from my business partners, I will intend to respond them as quickly as possible, in order to ensure our relationships. Second, we enjoy sharing our experience with others at the time. We often take photographs of our lunch. If it were restricted, some people would avoid visiting shops and restaurants in our town. It might damage their sales. Third, it is harmful for our rights to prohibit us from using our own mobile phones. It depends on our free will whether we use mobile phones anywhere. It is not desirable for our town's council to be criticized for a human rights violation. All in all, I oppose the idea for the reasons above. Yours faithfully, Mike Smith

Some people think that being honest in all situation is an important moral virtue. In my opinion, while telling the truth is an important thing in life, telling some lies in some crucial situations is acceptable. The importance of honesty can be demonstrated by a variety of reasons. Firstly, honesty develops a position of trust between us and others, which not only builds a strong bond between us but also fosters our self-confidence. Secondly, when we learn not to lie to others, they recognize us as an honest person and will respond to us with the same attitude. Furthermore, building relationships based on lies will always give us a high level of stress from exposing the lies we tell. On the other hand, sometimes honesty hurts more than it helps. In some dangerous or emergency situations telling the truth does not make sense and can even have a bad effect on the other person. For example, if someone has a heart problem and asks us about the truth about some of the bad things that have happened to his or her family, it is not right to tell him or her the truth. More than that, in some circumstances, when we should not give information about one person's status who is in danger, telling lies would be valuable and even will save his/her life. Thus, while the importance of honesty should not be underestimated, sometimes lies have a significant impact on a person's life or security.

In many schools, children learn how to write an essay, how to solve a mathematical problem and many other important subjects. All these subjects are meant to impart to the children the skills and the knowledge that they need for their foreseeable future and education. For some children, it also helps to determine their hobbies. The question is, why should music be a part of school curriculum? I believe that studying music supplies many advantages for children. In this essay, I will provide evidence that endorses studying music at school. Firstly, studying music at school allows children to discover their musical talents. There are many children whose home situation does not enable them to come in contact with music. Further, there are children whose parents cannot afford the instruments that they need to perform some kind of music. For these children, the school is a good place to discover whether music is a subject they want to specialize in or not. Secondly, studying music at school helps children to develop social and creativity skills. Many schools that impart music lessons, permit children to establish their music groups. Through this many children will learn how to work with other people, but also how to deal with problems like quarrels. Another advantage of studying music in schools is that music will incentivize the child's creativity, because children have the chance to write their songs and to provide group performances. To conclude, it is obvious that studying music at school provides many advantages for children and that music is even as important as other school subjects like history and Biology because it helps children to learn the needed social and creativity skills.

I think it is important to tell the truth in general. However, it is sometimes necessary to tell a lie, too. There are situations in which it is harmful for others to tell the truth. For example, suppose that your friends ask you about what you think of their clothes. Even if you think they are bad, you will compliment their style. If you were to frown at their style, it could result in annoying them. In another example, if you are not satisfied with a gift from your friends, you will not complain about it. After all, you should avoid disturbing others' feelings by telling them your true feelings. Although you sometimes might not be honest, it is significant to tell others the truth otherwise. If you choose not to be honest, it may lead to undesirable consequences. For instance, if you told your business partners fake information, you would end up losing their trust. This is a problem not only for you but also for both your colleague and your boss. He might have to take responsibility for his subordinate's faults, and resign. Thus, you should not tell a lie to others in a situation when it harms others. In conclusion, it is ever acceptable to tell a lie. However, it depends on the situation. It is most important to distinguish the situation you should tell a lie in from the one you should not.

Every season holds something special. However, to me, autumn happens to be the most magical season of the year. First of all, I find the weather to be quite endearing. The chilly winds of September are a nice break from the summer heat. The cold weather also indicates the beginning of sweater weather. I am in love with jumpers and anything with long sleeves, hence the cold weather is a great opportunity to start wearing layers once again. The landscape also becomes magnificent. The colourful leaves falling off the trees are almost mesmerising to look at. The ground covered with a blanket of colourful leaves makes any stroll much more pleasant. Autumn is also special because of Halloween. Although I no longer celebrate it as I used to, I feel delighted seeing other people enjoying themselves. This time of the year also unites several communities on social media, and together we celebrate the arrival of the spooky season.

Our relationship with our teachers is usually linked to many factors, like mutual trust and respect, as well as esteem. Like a majority of students, I think it's more interesting and better for students to have new teachers each year. There are many reasons for that belief. First of all, meeting different teachers during our learning gives us a good opportunity to improve our knowledge and skills, not only about topics but also about life. Secondly, having one teacher couldn't give you a possibility to discover different points of view. Finally, meeting different teachers means acquiring new learning approaches as well as new ways to resolve our usual problems. In other words, being taught by one teacher every year remains very boring and uninteresting even if the teacher is very qualified. To summarize my opinion, I would say I'm very convinced that changing teachers every year is very useful.

My dear friend, Finally, I got the chance to attend a Kayhan Kalhor concert last week. As you know, I have been a fan of him for many years, but I never got the chance to go to one of his concerts. Kayhan is an Iranian-Kurdish artist who is a professional kamanche player, one of the traditional musical instruments in Iran. He is not only a special artist for Iranians, but he is also known as a famous artist in many nations. In this concert, he played several of his outstanding pieces of music such as Halbach. The atmosphere of the concert was full of traditional Iranian feelings which took us to the villages of Kurdistan. All I needed at that moment was silence and to listen. I felt that I was on another level of life and I was looking at my life from a different perspective. It was really fascinating and I hope you could also one day find this opportunity to attend a concert of his. Regards, Fatemeh

In the first place, I will tell you where I went and what I saw. Then, I will shed light on the main reason why it was my favorite vacation of all time.

Video games are widespread among children. Playing video games might be advantageous to them. Nevertheless, it will bring some drawbacks if parents cannot control how their children play video games. This essay will analyze the advantages and disadvantages when children play video games. On the one hand, playing video games can be beneficial. Firstly, it helps children relax after hours of studying. When they have time to refresh, children will have more energy to go back to their studies. Secondly, while playing games, children can learn some new skills, such as problem-solving, time management, and teamwork (if they play games together), which are necessary for them later in life. Challenges in video games force children to think, to use their minds to find solutions, and to help each other for the final purpose. These are some benefits when children play video games. On the other hand, it might be harmful if children play games too much. Hours of looking at a screen will damage their eyes, which leads to many negative effects in children's life. They will not learn effectively and fully develop with unhealthy eyes. Also, playing games too much makes children tired. Because of that, they will be less active and lose their interests in other kinds of activities, such as running and playing outdoors. These are the reasons why parents should monitor and limit the time spent playing video games for their children. In conclusion, playing video games is a double-edged sword. Although it contributes positively to the development of children, there are still many drawbacks. Parents should be aware of these advantages and disadvantages to help their children control the use of video games.

To keep children occupied with useful activities is usually a great challenge for parents. In the past, reading a book or watching television was enough for children to enjoy themselves, but now it's very difficult to satisfy them. Video games are obviously the favourite occupation of children in this century. But why? In my modest opinion, it's due to the framework of the games: it provides them with all the things that they need, like advertisements, a connection with other friends, or a feeling of self-esteem. Many parents are unconscious of the danger that video games represent. It's proved that using video games for a long time leads children to a dangerous type of psychological disease like schizophrenia. I continue to believe strongly that video games are very dangerous and I will do everything in my ability to prevent my children from using them. Instead of that, I will certainly encourage them to be friends with books and magazines. To summarize my opinion, I will encourage my children to be creative.

Many people believe that having the same teachers for several years is beneficial for students. And some think that changing the teachers every year is better. For me, both situations have many pros and cons. The advantages of having the same teachers are that the teachers know their students better and they also keep track of the development of students. On the other hand, the teachers will have a bias against some students and like others. Another disadvantage is that students have been taught the same idea of living and that is not useful because the students should be taught different ideas. For the people who would like to have new teachers each year, there are many benefits. For example, students will learn new things and new critical thinking. Both teachers and students learn how to adapt to each other which is a good lesson for real life. But the problem of changing the teacher is teachers don't know their students well and it will take a long time in order for them to get along with each other well. In conclusion, I think that having new teachers is better than having the same teachers because to learn new things with new people is good for learning life skills.

First and foremost, it is common knowledge that working out is important for our health. However, doing sports is not enough to be in good shape, for crying out loud! There is another major aspect that needs to be taken into consideration. First of all, I will explain why exercise should be part of our daily routine. Then, I will shed light on the need to have good eating habits. To begin with, to do some exercise you don't need to run a marathon. Most people resent sports because they believe it is too demanding and painful. As a matter of fact, you just need to walk thirty minutes per day to be in shape. It's not rocket science. For those who like to challenge themselves, there are a lot of activities that can be practised, such as cross-fit. Moreover, exercise can have other positive impacts. Not only is it important for our body but it is also essential for our mind. Indeed, exercising prevents depression, stress, and anxiety. Notwithstanding the fact that exercise is important, our eating habits come before anything else when it comes to being healthy. In any case, we need to be careful about what we put on our plate. For instance, it is important to have the right amount of carbs, proteins, and nutriments. That is to say, we should avoid fat and sugar. Furthermore, we need to drink at least two liters of water each day to help our body to recover. There is no age to start a healthy way of living. Better late than never!

Many would agree that the ultimate goal of life is to live longer and in happiness. Clearly, living a modest life for 100 years for me is more valuable than living only 20 years in abundance. I believe that living longer is better because it is a sign of a well-lived life and a longer service for other people. I believe in the old adage that says "to live better you need to hide." People who live a good life are generally those who have chosen to do everything moderately. For example, having good health habits such as eating moderately and not allowing excess alcohol might lengthen one's life. Although the length of one's life can be determined by many factors, one should definitely avoid dangerous activities. Some people, for instance, choose to drive very carelessly or very fast on the road just to show to the world how smart they are. This behaviour, sometimes, can lead to a sudden death. Moreover, living an intense life doesn't always mean living well or being helpful to other people. For example, mother Theresa of India had lived a long life but had been of a tremendous help for many people in the world. This means that life does not necessarily need to be intense to be meaningful. Many have lived a long and enjoyable life without being famous or known by everyone on every side of the globe. This said, I prefer a longer and smooth life instead of a short life full of excessive behaviour. To conclude, we do not all determine the length of our life. And we can only try to bring the best out of the time we have existed.

I started using Write and Improve a few days ago and I am really excited about it. Firstly, write and improve is a programme on the Internet which helps you improve your English writing. There are many different topics you can choose and write about. The programme is able to correct your text and show you what level of English it was. Based on the feedback you can fix mistakes in your essay and the programme will show you your progress. But how does it check your text exactly? The programme shows you all the mistakes in spelling and grammar which are common in most of the writing programs. What's more, Write and Improve will check your whole sentences too. On the other hand, there are some things missing in this programme. In this programme there should be also tips which could help you improve your text when you have corrected everything and have no mistakes left. Furthermore, in Write and Improve there are some mistakes too. I used one common English phrase and this programme corrected me. All things considered, I would recommend Write and Improve for all students who want to learn how to write in English. Anyway there is still a lot of space to upgrade this helpful tool for students.

Since the world was created, animals have lived in free areas, such as jungles or great forests. Our unsustainable development has led us unhappily to an ecological disaster for the last three decades. We have seen how pollution and immoral modernity have massively destroyed all the eco-systems around the world. Biodiversity has been highly and negatively impacted. Animals were eventually among the unlikely victims of those huge impacts and some people that thought they were doing the right thing, thought up this tragic and stupid invention: the zoo. Zoos could be a real space for protecting animals, but actually they are a real prison for animals. In other words, zoos highly change the environment of animals. In my modest opinion, zoos remain a bad solution for protecting animal whereas the real solution is to provide animals with free space and give them protection in order to leave them to live as the ever creature of god live: free.

Dear Major Muller, I'm writing to ask you to dismiss the idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Nowadays, mobile phones are an important part of our lives. While using the public transport, they can help us to catch up with the latest news or stay in contact with our friends. Furthermore, there is also a wallet. Apps enable us to use it as a credit card or even as a ticket to be able to access public transport. I understand that it can be annoying if someone is having a phone call while being in a restaurant or using the public transport, but in world where everything is connected that is the price we have to pay. If our town were to ban the use of mobile phones in public transport or in shops and restaurants, we would disconnect our town from the world. This ban could also lead to the fact that more people will use their car instead of public transport. But using a car is not only bad for the environment, it is also more dangerous to use your phone while driving than it is to use it in a bus or in a metro. As there is no harm done to anyone, it makes no sense to ban the use of mobile phones in public transport or in restaurants and shops. I appreciate all that you do for our city. Sincerely, Ben Singer

First and foremost, digitalisation has brought us many changes and challenges. Our environment has drastically evolved and no realm had been left aside. In this situation, what about schools ? How will they be in the future? Will they still be the same? First of all, I will tell you why I believe schools will be different soon enough. However, I will also explain why some things will remain the same. To begin with, digitalisation has entered our life at all stages. As a matter of fact, we now have access to a large range of skills and tools. Smartphones, computers, and tablets are made available for everyone. Additionally, artificial intelligence can provide a new learning approach. On that ground, I think the school of the future will use those different applications to reinvent itself and offer new possibilities. For example, screens could be incorporated into desk surfaces. Furthermore, kids need to be able to use any technological device easily. Not only is it a way to fit in with the world but it is also essential to find a job. Moreover, I believe, in just a few years from now, students won't need to attend classrooms anymore. Indeed, I think e-learning will become extremely popular. Actually, a lot of business schools are already using it and it is an outstanding success, for crying out loud! However, I believe some aspects will still be the same. For instance, there will still be teachers and grades. Last but not least, I believe human contact is a need for young children and it can't be replaced by artificial intelligence. Finally, all those transformations will take some time. Better late than never.

Hi Matt, You must be happy about the new school year. I hope you can reach your target to improve in Math and History. I need to improve my English. I've arranged what I want to do to improve it. First, I've just joined a private course in pronunciation. I've prepared a 30-day challenge of writing to post on English Course App, and I'll continue over the next 30 days by adding to it with something else, probably speaking.

Would you mind giving me a recommendation of what I should read, Matt? Good luck with your new school year. Uly

I would live a shorter life rather than live a long life. There are two reasons why I think so. First, I can not be viable all my lifetime. At the end of my life, I will not be active like before, and I can only stay in a hospital. I cannot endure the situation that I manage to live with the aid of medicine. I would like to pursue something until my life is over. Even more, we can enjoy our freedom because it is limited by the surroundings. If I lived in a long life, I would have few things to do and would be bored with my freedom. Second, in my opinion, a shorter life is more stimulating than a longer one. As I get older, I will experience less owing to physical disabilities. It seems to me that people face too many things between their 20s and their 50s. Therefore, unless I died in my twenties, I could have variable experience. I could become satisfied with it. Moreover, I set my life plan in which I will be dead in my seventies. Considering the scheme, I am willing to try anything as long as I am viable. It leads to making me busy, but at the same time I can enjoy my time more than others. In conclusion, I prefer living a shorter life to living a longer life. It is significant for me to be active during my lifetime. Thus, I always make a lot of effort to fulfill my life.

Fighting ignorance is a huge and difficult struggle. Since we were children we have been involved in that. When we integrate school earlier, we choose our way towards discovery and learning. Students had almost the same dream, which is to continue their studies abroad, especially when they are living in countries less developed than mine. This difficult choice has advantages as well as disadvantages. The biggest advantage that it has, in my opinion, is that it allows students to continue their course at a high-level school. One other important advantage is that it permits students to discover a new culture as well as a new civilisation and eventually learn about new concepts and a new field of learning. The disadvantages of this painful choice are numerous, like the psychological impact of being abroad and the difficulties that students face in foreign countries, for example racism or xenophobia. To summarize my opinion, I prefer continuing my studies in my country, even if conditions aren't sufficient, rather than taking useless risks.

First of all I would like to say that I am not a university student yet. That means that my opinion is not based on my own experience. Firstly, life as a university student might be hard and many students spend with more than 40 hours per week in their school which is the usual work time in the Czech Republic. With this in mind, it would be very hard for some students to do a job. I believe that the parents ought to support their children financially during their studies. The important question is whether the student should live at home. In my opinion, it is subjective. The main advantage of living with parents could be the fact that you have really great background and it is cheaper than living on your own. On the other hand, when you decide to live alone or with your friends you will probably become more responsible and independent. Furthermore, I believe that staying too long with your parents is not good for your relationship and your psychological development. All things considered, I think that everyone should choose for himself and both choices are all right.

First and foremost, globalisation and digitalisation have brought many changes to our world, for crying out loud! They have changed the way we work, we travel, and communicate. For instance, low-cost airline companies appeared and home offices have become common knowledge. Better late than never. Not only is it more important than it used to be but it is also an obligation in some cases. First of all, I will tell you why I believe it is essential to speak a foreign language in 2020. Then, I will share my views regarding some aspects. To begin with, it has become more and more difficult to find a job nowadays. Repeated crises have transformed the world. It has become particularly difficult to fulfill a company's expectations. Presently, major market brands are asking people to be fluent in another language, such as English, Spanish, or Chinese. It might sound demanding, but this is the way it works. Moreover, people are travelling way more than they used to do. For example, a lot of students go for a world tour after finishing their degree. In this case, it is better though not obligatory to speak English in order to be able to communicate with foreigners. Last but not least, some people are interested in learning about another language because it's part of a country's culture. Notwithstanding, in my opinion it is important to discover a different language from one's native one. I believe it also depends on your way of living. Indeed, if someone doesn't like to travel or is not interested in working in an international company there is no need to spend time on learning another language. I believe it matters to shed light on different opinions.

It goes without saying that being an honest individual often implies being truthful and not telling lies. However, is it even necessary? After all, there are countless situations that are more advantageous to tell a little bit of falsehood. A good illustration of this is omitting a case that could damage a person's feelings. Furthermore, there are some educational untruths; for instance, teaching how to eat, make a bed, or even to instruct how to brush teeth; they can be supported by some deceits. Let us focus on such idea as omitting a fact, for as much as there are some consequences for the person who will receive this information. For instance, a mortal who has a terminal illness; perhaps in some cases the best option is not to tell the reality to this citizen. Moreover, another aspect relevant to this context, depending on the condition of the disease, the malaise is so advanced that a good solution is let him to die without knowing his real condition. On the other hand, there are pros in relation to educating a child with little lies, since it is impossible to try to have a mature conversation with an offspring. Additionally, apart from educating, another benefit is to facilitate the parents' life, in other words, a young person will not accomplish a mischief, because he will be afraid of those situations. To sum up, to tell an untruth now and then does not cause many complications for a child's mental health. Nevertheless, I am convinced that there are uncountable ways to tell a lie, and oftentimes they are positive, as much for the individual who receives the advice as the person who lies, only by understanding that each human has their own convictions and cultures.

I believe, having different teachers for students each year is a good thing, because each teacher has their own style of teaching that they use to foster students' understanding. In addition to that, each teacher has different qualities and skills, thus, introducing new teachers to students each year is an opportunity for them to learn more skills and help them engage more academically At my school, we had different teachers for each individual year. And we had the opportunity to learn many useful things from them. Some people believe that students should have one teacher for many years. In my opinion, that would create some sort of boredom among students, as well as students not having the chance to learn different skills that may be found in multiple teachers. Finally, in my opinion, different teachers with different perspectives and horizons would enhance the academic experience for students to the fullest extent. That's why I think it is very important to introduce different teachers to students each year.

Hi! My favourite film is, "Aladdin." I like that movie, because I like all the action, I like the story. One of my favourite parts is when the actors sing the song called "Prince Ali," and I laugh at a scene where Aladdin is funny. I also like the part where Aladdin and Jasmin sing the song called "A whole new world." Something really cool about the movie is that the dancing is really good and it's amazing how the actors dance. The bad guy in this film is called Jafar, he is a greedy wizard who wants the entire kingdom for himself. You should really see it, because you like films about magic, and fairy tales. You also like the desert a lot. I hope you see the film I recommended for you. Hope you are well, bye!

In my opinion, playing video games has a lot more benefits for children than some people think. Children can play video games, but parents should arrange their time to play games properly. The most important thing for children is that they can grow, play , be funny and happy according to their age. Video games are a part of children's memory. I support children playing video games for many reasons. The first reason is that video games can improve fine motor skills and also language development. Because most video games use English as a communication language with other players, their English will get better. The second reason, if someone is fond of the game, they may have the dream to be a game developer, who is a person that invents or creates new games or new items. The third reason, now there are many game competitions or electronic sports (E-sport) around the world. Many children turn into E-sport gamers and win in a contest. Another reason, some children can earn money by themselves because when they reach any high level, they can sell special items to other players. The last reason is video games can help to solve the mental problem of children who are addicted to games. In conclusion, video games have both pros and cons. If people arrange their time properly, they can get many benefits from video games.

In my opinion, zoos are good places for people to learn about animals because it is necessary to understand their way of life. Zoos could be important places to open the mind of people who don't care about animals' well-being. Moreover, zoos raise people's awareness about endangered species. Many people don't know that a species like the white bear could disappear in 2100. Additionally, zoos are very useful to help injured animals. Near my home, we have a zoo specialized in dolphin re-education. However, there are a few reports of animal abuse in zoos. Some of them don't respect animals' dignity and their principal needs. For example, a monkey died at Abidjan zoo deprived of food and love. Furthermore, some species become crazy because of visitors' noise, small cages, and loneliness. As a consequence, some of them hit themselves. To conclude, zoos have a great purpose, but instead of saving and protecting species they conduct them to an untimely passing.

Hello Matt, How are you? I hope you are in good shape. Thank you for your kindness and for being my English buddy. I want to tell you about my favourite film. It's from India, the title of the film is "Mumbai." I don't know the exact genre of this film. Probably it is action, comedy and a historical film because the story is based on a real tragedy in India. Then, there are funny bits in some scenes. It is about terrorism so, as I said, the film is an action film. The film tells us about a tragedy which happens in one of the hotels in Mumbai. There are three terrorists who hijack the hotel. They are Muslim terrorists who had a command from a person they don't know. Their commander said that they in a God way. But actually, it's not about it. I mean, the commander just exploited the people to his advantage. There is one scene I really love. It's when there is a conflict among the terrorists. They argue about killing a Muslim woman. One says that he can't kill her because she is Muslim. But the others say he must kill her because the commander said that. You must watch this film, Matt. I think you're going to love this film too. Regards, Uly.

On the one hand, it is obvious that health is the first and most important aspect for human beings and should not be compared with other aspects of life. In the absence of health, an abundant amount of money cannot help and heal the pain of body and soul. If one person does not have a good state of health, he/she cannot do any type of activity during the day and cannot enjoy the physical activities that require a healthy body, even if his/her bank deposit is large. On the other hand, the influence of money on a healthy lifestyle cannot be underestimated. A person who has more money can easily provide better living conditions and also consume better and more varied food, which leads to better health of the body. Also, they can spend a pleasant holiday that helps their mental well-being. In conclusion, while money can create better circumstances for a superior and healthier lifestyle, I think maintaining health should be the first goal in our lives, as working and making more money is possible only with a healthy mind and body.

I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. It is more important to be healthy because if your body isn't healthy, you will feel very sick. You will have a lot of complications in your body. You would have to take a lot of different kinds of medicine, and if you get even worse, you would die. If you are rich, and decide not to be healthy, and waste all your money on things that don't help you to be healthy, or that are just useless, it won't help you, you get worse, and die and all that money you had was useless. Being healthy helps your body to be strong, and to not have any bad diseases. That is why you have to be healthy. You should do exercise, eat healthy, and have a balanced diet. That is my opinion about which is better, to be rich or to be healthy.

The history of travel is so exciting: humans started travelling by using camels and now we see the endless opportunities that we have to travel around the world. I think about planes, boats, or trains; but what about our journeys in the future? In my modest opinion, travel will be more exciting and innovative in the future. We will certainly see many new kinds of travel. Not only will we have a new form of travel like travelling through space but also humans will be able to discover another planet and maybe a big hotel will be built there. The future of travel will be obviously more enjoyable and surely linked with environmental questions, like climate issues or energy sufficiency.

In my opinion, doing exercise is very important for our health and our well-being. Obviously, you don't have to do exercise each day because it takes a lot of your time and it is tiring for many people. On the contrary, you can do exercise, for example, twice per week. Moreover, if you do sport with a friend, you can get more motivation and you could become better. To do this, it is also important to set yourself a purpose. However, exercise is not the only thing that is important for our health. Indeed, there is an obvious link between nutrition and health. Eating healthy food is the first step to having better health. Additionally, eating better is also good behavior to protect our environment. Combining daily exercise and healthy food is the best answer ever to maintain our health. To conclude, I think that exercise and nutrition are important for our health.

We are having a great change in our society nowadays because of this COVID-19 situation. We are forced to stay at home and do remote work. Many schools also need to change in this circumstance. In the future, students won't have to go to school. They will be able to learn all subjects at home at internet schools. They cooperate with other students through an online conference system. They can get any information needed for their studies from websites all over the world. They even do sports using online sports applications named "e-sports." As I said above, we can do everything online except direct interaction with others. We know that physical contact is still important for children's development. We have to build playgrounds or gymnasiums at school because students need places to play. But we won't need school buildings anymore. We won't need to have as many teachers as we have now, because only a few teachers can teach all students through the internet, and AI may help teachers' work.

Dear Town Council, I think banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants is not a good idea at all. As mobile phones have been near humans for over two decades and these electronic devices can be taken anywhere and can be opened within seconds, banning would result in people taking laptops everywhere they go and also using laptops the whole time, which would again lead to a mass protest. As the digital age grows, mobile phones get better and advanced than other devices. As the name suggests 'mobile phone', people can take it anywhere without an additional 2.3 kg. Imagine this, people taking laptops everywhere they go. In restaurants, shops, restaurants and on public transport. Some people would just be using the laptops to navigate and call and even take photos. That would be awkward for a normal mobile phone user as laptops can only be used for selfies and when not held nicely, it may drop and get damaged. While on the other hand, mobile phones can be used for both selfies and normal photos. As other devices are mostly just for work, school and others, mobile phones can do everything. They can be used for work, banking, researching and more. Consider this whether mobile phones should be banned or not. If mobile phones are banned it would lead to a huge protest which could make most high ranking workers resign.

I disagree with it. There are three reasons why I oppose that opinion. First, sports activities are the only solution to keep people healthy. Running or doing yoga can also work as a method of promoting our health. If universities and schools made their students exercise in their facilities, it would be difficult to fulfill all students' favors. Some students would not be satisfied with the schools' policies. However, if the schools let their students exercise outside, it would be also hard to manage the students' activities. Briefly, it is absurd from scratch to force students to do exercises regularly. Second, there is little scientific evidence to support the frequency of playing sports. Is it really enough to do exercise three times a week? This opinion does not explain at all how many hours we should exercise in a week. At least, those who are in favor of this opinion should provide information about the basis of their statement. In my opinion, they cannot get support from others without showing prominent scientific evidence. Third, I think it is not always good to make much effort to become healthier. It is true that there may be no problem for many people to be forced to do physical activities. However, it is not the case for some people with disabilities. Such people cannot participate in sports as well as ordinary people. To improve our inactive lifestyle, we only have to increase the opportunities of exercise. It is appropriate for only healthy people, and this idea utterly ignores people who are willing to exercise but cannot do it. If the given opinion pervades among a lot of universities and schools, it will be natural to get rid of people with disabilities. Thus, I am against this opinion. It seems to me that this opinion is not persuasive and dangerous. Therefore, I would never admit it.

In my opinion, the transport sector was badly hit by the current pandemic. Therefore, this sector will need to be more ecological. For me, in the future, people will travel by plane or by train because it will be faster and safer. Planes could go to any city in less than 2 hours thanks to supersonic technologies. Of course, people will still take boats, but only for pleasure. Indeed, in our future society, taking a boat to travel will not be ecological because of the use of petrol. Therefore, a majority of people will take the train for the same reasons that they will take planes, the speed. In the future, they will only take transport for the speed and not for the landscape. Of course, cars will always be used but only electric cars. To conclude, the future of travel will combine two factors, ecology and speed. This will be necessary to protect our earth and travel on our planet.

These days, balancing the practical and theoretical work is one of the most important conflicts in the education system. One program which is offered by specialists is involving students in practical work through volunteer work. Community service has some pros and cons and, considering these, it is important to make a good decision for teenagers. At first, working in a volunteer environment in high school can help students to improve their skills. Working as a volunteer increases their confidence and prepares them for doing a real job. In addition, learning a work ethic is one of the most important aims of doing community service. Students learn how they can help other people. Volunteer teachers are mostly patient and energetic people. These characteristics help teenagers to change their bad behaviors and develop their passions and ingenuity. On the other hand, volunteer work can unsettle students' balance of time management. Students must deal with doing homework, sport, preparing for exams and practical work. Generally, community service lacks structure and this can lead students to be confused about managing their time. Besides, some volunteer atmospheres are unsafe and uncertain. People who work in these places can be different and unknown. So, finding a good environment is important and parents and the school’s staff must consider it precisely. In conclusion, developing social and professional skills is valuable and useful for students. Achieving these goals needs a practical plan and considering enough time in school. Therefore, community service has some significant advantages for teenage students. The disadvantages of volunteer work are less important than its goodness. By helping peers to manage their time and providing secure surroundings can reinforce volunteer plans in high schools. Hence, students are able to be professional people in society after finishing high school.

Hello Lisa, As I promised you in my last letter, I want to tell you about the concert I was at last week. It was not a usual concert but an open-air one. There were so many people! And everyone sat on the ground on the blankets or chairs they had brought with them. I liked the atmosphere there, especially when the sun went down and it got dark. The orchestra on the stage played mostly classical music, but sometimes also famous songs, like the intro to the "Star Wars" film. Altogether I enjoyed this concert very much and would like to go there again next year. Maybe we can do it together. What do you think about it? You have already been planning to come over next summer, so maybe this event will be one of the interesting things for you here! How are you? How was your weekend? I am looking forward to your answer! With love, Genja

Recently, I have new things that I love to do in my free time, chat with my new friend, read some articles in English, and the last is to watch a movie where I will repeat the dialogue. Usually, I do those things after college. My favourite one is chatting with my new friend. He always makes my day. The second is watching a movie. I really need to do it because I want more input in English to help my memory. Sometimes I am not even only repeating the dialogue, but also writing it in my book so I can read it again later.

Well, the advantages are that in other countries there are more opportunities than in poor countries. Also there are more choices of career and it is easy to be recognised or have a better job. But the disadvantages are that you're far from your family, and there's also the language because the most important universities are in English or Chinese . Also, you do not know too many people abroad and that could be a problem for social communication. In conclusion it is a good idea to study abroad but it depends on each family , if you are studying a lot and you want to have a go at a good degree course, it is an option to study abroad, but if you want to do an easy degree course you can study at a local university. Also, it depends on the economic situation because studying abroad is very expensive. But if you are intelligent and you don't have a lot of money some universities have options for big discounts if you're very intelligent.

Sport is a very important exercise for our health. Doing sports, especially in the morning, has a huge benefit on our morale as well as our mood. Personally, I prefer going jogging. This old sport is easy and helpful. We can do it either in cities or in gardens. As I live near the sweet beaches, what I like a lot is obviously swimming as well as surfing; these two sports have many advantages and have numerous good effects on our health. We can do them regularly and easily, either during spring or summer. I continue to believe that there are many other activities, apart from sport, that we can practise, like yoga and meditation. These two Asian disciplines are widely practiced, not only in India but also in other countries around the world. To summarize my opinion, I’m convinced that sport is the main activity that has a good and deep impact on our health and consequently on our heart.

Travelling as we know it and did for decades will come to an end. Due to the ongoing discussion about the environmental costs of easy travelling things will start to change. In the future, fewer people will use cheap flights for unnecessary weekend trips to sunny spots of the earth. More and more people will become conscious and will try to avoid putting stress on the environment when starting over for holidays. So, having fun in the neighbourhood by, for example, doing bicycle tours or walking and hiking will see a renaissance. This will also strengthen the rural economy, so that money can be spent to develop local infrastructure and local offers. This will lead to a broader variety of possibilities. In the end, lots of people will find options for their vacation nearby. Spending gallons of kerosene and polluting the sky and environment to allow people to have weekends in Spain for less than 30 euros will soon be a thing of the past.

In high schools there are a lot of different groups which do some voluntary projects. There are, for example, teams who organize balls, another group makes different products with the high school logo and another grows plants and flowers in the school garden. And there are always students who are in a thousand communities and other students who are in none of them. But what if joining a voluntary team will become mandatory? On one hand, by doing some work for high school, students learn a lot of skills they will need later in their adult life. Skills like working in a team or carrying responsibility are very important independently of where you are going to work later. In addition, high schools also get profit from such work, because students mostly know better what other students need and how to make their school day better. On the other hand, there are students who are already in some sport clubs or music schools. And they maybe they do not have time for any voluntary work at high school, so it can get very difficult for them to manage everything and to do homework too. In summary I think that obligatory work for high schools is a good thing if it does not need too much time and you still have a choice about what kind of work you would like to do.

In fact, video games are very popular nowadays with children. Recently, technology has made it easy for children to have fun in the comfort of their homes compared to the times when children very often needed to be taken outdoors to have entertainment, and that's very good. However, there are indeed some positive and negative effects. The positive effects of video games on children is that children can have more fun at home - playing and expressing themselves through games. In addition, the parents of the children will have the chance to do home activities while the children are busy playing video games. In spite of that, the content of video games can be very aggressive nowadays, and not appropriate for young children who are under 18 years old because this will exert a negative impact on the child's personality. Because they are at an age where they aren't allowed to view violent or aggressive content even when they are on the Internet. Although parents can still have control on what their children are viewing, either on television or the internet or a video game. And apparently, computer devices now have parental control settings, where parents can restrict or trace their children’s activity online. With the appearance of some video games that contain violent scenes, children are becoming more violence-loving. And that is what explains the violence among schoolchildren recently, such as the violence we see in some shooting and murder games, although these games are targeted at teenagers and adults. But young children are increasingly wanting to play such games, because they have spread among their older siblings. I think parents need to be aware of the good types of video games to buy for their children and make sure these games do not contain violence and are targeted at the age of their children.

Some employers think that separate spaces are better for their employees than open offices, while others believe that this will reduce the quality of work. In my opinion, it totally depends on the type of work and job that company is doing. If the type of work falls into a category which requires deep focus, then, a shared office will not be not a good idea. The distraction caused by others will drain the employees' concentration and the quality of work will be decreased. For example, in a programming company, the employees need a quiet environment to focus on their codes, and a noisy place or a place full of movement will not let them focus on their work. On the other hand, some type of companies need a sharing office since contacting with other colleagues during the work time will generate more creative ideas and can lead to a strong relationship between them which is needed for work. Furthermore, some of the projects are defined to be done in a team and offices with an open design can make the team's results more effective as the team members are constantly in touch with each other and all the team know the progress of the project and what will be the next step.

I got a little scared but the good thing was that nothing happened, then he got in again. I went to dance at a disco at night and I met several girls who were very pretty, some of my classmates went with them but I stayed dancing with some girls and friends because, you know, my girlfriend hit me.

In my opinion, the better choice for these students is to move away and live on their own while they are attending school. Of course, this is the most difficult choice because it is necessary for these students to work and get their own salary. With a job, they have less time for their other activities like working on their exercises, having fun with their friends or cooking. Therefore, with this experience, they can become more independent and responsible. They can also gain autonomy. However, living at home with their family is also a good choice. They are less lonely, they have always contact with their family and they feel better. Moreover, one of the main advantages of this situation is that these students spend less money. However, it is easier for them to have a party in their flat than in their parents' home. Personally, I have lived both experiences and I preferred it when I was alone, in my own flat.

Nowadays children do not go outside to play ball or to have a picnic, as they usually sit in front of their computers and watch movies or chat with someone. To solve the problem of a deficit of activities which comes up through such a lifestyle, some schools and universities want to make sport training mandatory for everyone. What advantages and disadvantages does it bring? A good point about it is that children have the possibility to spend their afternoon together. Especially younger children are not able to organize any afternoon activities without parents. So they have to stay home and make the best of it by surfing through the web. But by doing something together like playing football or dancing they learn not only sport skills but also communicating and working in a team. Another point is that parents often do not have enough time to find any sport clubs for their children and as a result children have no possibility to try any sports and to find out which one is interesting for them. But if schools provide plenty of sports, it will be easier for children to choose an attractive one. On the other hand, if the variety of sports provided by school or university is not big, it could be a problem, because not everyone likes football or dance. There are also children who like, for example, riding or playing table tennis. As a result these young people have to choose between sports they like and sports they have to do. And this is not the sense of the idea. But there is a simple solution for this problem, when children are allowed to do either sports in their school or in some other clubs which do not belong to school. In a summary, I think that forcing children to do sport is a good opportunity for their health and their development. But they still must have chances to choose what they like to do.

Well, video games have some impact on the attitude of children. For example, a child that plays video games every day, in the future he doesn't want to have a single day without playing any video games, and that could be a very big problem, especially for children and also adults that can't stop playing video games. But also some video games help to learn, which is positive because if children want to play video games it's better they play and learn at the same time. Also, some studies say that learning and playing is better for children under 12 years old to learn a lot than the classic way of only listening and reading, which is better for older people. For example, a child that learns at the same time that he plays learns a lot because he or she is in a good mood. That's essential for learning. In conclusion, children don't have to play video games all the time, but if a child only wants to play, we can replace them with educational games.

I've always believed animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. The reason is because each animals suffers being in small cages, with not much food and with people treating them in such a bad way. Let's try and image a lion locked up in a little space with the only possibility to move around the cage the whole day. It needs to be free, that way it can be everything it wants. I also agree to learn more about animals because discovering new things about them can give us the opportunity to understand our life better and our development as a society. The problem is that you can learn about them, but there is not need to lock them in cages. In fact you can do it directly in nature and not by relegate them in limited spaces. It's not necessary and makes them bored and sad.

What is the difference between working in cities and working in rural areas? For most medical doctors the difference is huge and, as weird as it sounds, all of them prefer to work in cities. They put forward several arguments to justify their choices. At first, they think that in cities they could have many customers rather than if they work in rural areas. For example, some of them claim that they can earn three times what they can earn in small villages. Some other doctors justify their choice by presenting other arguments: the existence of a high school and the availability of gardens or cinemas in cities. In my opinion , neither of these arguments are strong nor they are convincing because working in the rural areas or in the villages is so helpful for communities as well as for citizens. To sum up, I have a great esteem for doctors who prefer to forget their self-centredness and eventually agree to help people living in rural areas.

Living in a village or near the city can be very nice, because you have fresh air, neighbours you know and a quiet atmosphere. But there is one big problem about living in the rural areas: there is always a deficit of medical doctors. There are many reasons for this phenomenon. One of them is that people are mostly interested in growth of their career and in a big city they have a better chance for it. They can start in a little hospital and by working hard and making enough connections they maybe can open their own practice and earn a lot of money. Another important point is that children and husbands or wives of doctors have more possibilities to find a job or to go to an excellent school or university in a bigger city than in a village. In rural areas there is always only one school children have to go to or they must spend an hour or longer every day to participate in a school in a neighbouring place. I think that a good option to spread medical doctors through the whole landscape equally is to improve infrastructures in rural areas, so people living there will not feel isolated and it will be more attractive for everyone to move to rural areas than to metropolises.

Firstly, I would like to mention that I am very pleased with my progress in both speaking and writing because I have dedicated my time to practising speaking and writing very often.

On top of that, I would also want to improve my listening skills although my listening is quite good, but I sometimes get lost when listening to Australian and New Zealand accents. Because I am more used to the British accent, and it is the first accent I heard when I was learning English. There are certain things that I will do to accomplish my goals in this new school year. Concerning my grammar, I will read one grammar book thoroughly and try to practise as much as possible. And regarding my listening skills, I will listen to English podcasts in different accents simultaneously.

Taking care of animals is always attractive to people. Environmental concern makes people find ways to keep species safe. But preserving animals in zoos or in nature is the disagreement between different group. Some people believe animals belong in natural surrounding and the others prefer to visit animals in zoos. In my opinion, there are some justifications for both arguments, but visiting species in nature is more acceptable for me. Being in a secure space is the first reason for maintaining animals in zoos. Some people believe humans can protect species which are in danger by putting them in a cage. In addition, bringing animals into zoos is the best way to educate people about their habitat. Researching animals’ behavior and how to treat illnesses is easier in zoos. On the other hand, the species suffer from physical and mental problems because they are deprived of being in nature. The space in zoos is not the same as in nature for them. Mental problems cause stress for animals and they may die earlier than when they live in a natural environment. Also, keeping animals in a small cage ruins their freedom. They cannot function like they do when living in nature. In conclusion, one stage of overcoming nature is dealing with wild species. Some people prefer to keep animals in zoos to control and know about them. But for others it is enjoyable to see animals being free and living somewhere they belong. I also prefer to see animals in their natural environment and respect their freedom.

Last week, I went on a holiday to Vancouver city in western Canada. It was the best holiday I ever had and it was full of joyfulness and experience. I have learnt so many things. Vancouver is a bustling metropolis full of life. I visited wonderful places such as Stanley Park, Gastown, and the Museum of Vancouver, and I saw incredible things. I can say those were the most astonishing places I have ever been to. I also gave myself a chance to experience the landscapes, so I went 30 minutes away from the Vancouver downtown to be in Capilano Suspension Bridge Park to experience the fresh air. In the Museum of Vancouver I took lots of pictures of the World War II veterans and I also read a little bit about the history of that place. What I like most in Vancouver is the cultural diversity and open-mindedness of its people - they are very welcoming and friendly. In addition, the nightlife is Vancouver is incomparable to other cities in the world, it is very special for restaurants and cafes. I really fell in love with this fun-loving city and I hope I will have the chance to visit again.

Hello Leyla, It's been quite a while now since we met. I got your invitation for the party. And I was hoping to attend the party but due to some emergency I could not attend. Hope you are not angry with me. So, what happened at the party? I heard Mike was also there. Now I can imagine how great the party might have been. Tell me about something I missed and should know.

First of all, free time is a gift which comes very rarely in a student's life. And when it comes, it is really necessary to use it in the best possible way. In my free time I just grab a good book and start to read. It helps me to rejuvenate my mind. And I think this is the best I can do in my free time. Thank you.

Hi Bilal, How are you. Hope you're doing great. So, last week our school organized a trip for students to the museum. It was our first experience at the museum and as we expected it turned out to be the same. The trip was very good. We got to know about dinosaurs, skeletons and our evolution. We saw every skeleton in the museum and took photos with them for our memories. This trip was good, not just because we enjoyed it, but because we learned a lot about our history. We got to know about our ancestors and we also met them, not in mortal form but through the remains of their body.

I love exercise. I am trying to do exercise every day. I spend between twenty five minutes and forty minutes on doing exercise a day. Usually, I do it over six or five days. I prefer exercising outside, like walking. I choose this way because I feel that I can connect with nature at the same time as I make my body follow activities for better health. I love sports in a group. When I was ateenager I practiced soccer and other exercise like that, now I choose to swim to help me achieve quality of life.

There is a lot of controversy about the use of video games by children. In my opinion, it depends on how they use the video game. It can be good or can be bad. First of all, the time. If children use a video game in their free time, for instance, for hours on end, it will be very bad. If they play violent games with deaths, and they are very young the routine will be worse. It is dangerous when it becomes an addiction that the child needs to feed everyday, and if they don't have the video game they will be nervous. It is very common nowadays. However, if the time with the video game has a clear limit, if the parents supervise the time and the kind of game, no problem. I guess if the game is interesting and it uses logic and intelligence it can be great for the children. Another good option is to use the video game to exercise. Today, we have some games to make movements too.

I started learning English when I was 3 years old with my mother. I learnt it as my second language, which made me able to communicate with more people and just for fun. However, when I started high school, I realized that English was more important than I thought because it would help me get more opportunity to study abroad with a good English score. Moreover, most reference textbooks I read are written in English more than in my native language. And also, I need to improve my English communication skills because I don't use English much in my everyday life, so I still feel uncomfortable communicating in English when I haven't used it regularly. Finally, I hope I can get a good score in the exam and can enter a good school because of my good English skills in the future.

Hello, Matt! How's it going? Yes, you're right! I need to improve in English. Well, to improve my English, I have created a schedule. The activity begins on Monday and it finishes on Saturday. Every day there is an activity. Every morning I wake up at 6:00 am, I make my bed and when it is 7 o'clock, I begin to study English with BBC Learning English. With BBC Learning English, I study at least 5 days per week. By nighttime, I begin to improve my skills in English. They are speaking, reading, writing and listening... I also answer some questions. I work with each skill on one specific day. On Monday, I work on my speaking skills using the app Cake and Elsa. On Tuesday, I work on my reading skills using Lit2go. Lit2go has one story available with transcription and audio. It's a kind of audiobook and it also has an activity available. On Wednesday, I work on my listening. I also use the Cake app. I always choose one idiomatic expression available on the app and I try to use some rules to improve that skill. I'll stop now. The text will be very long. See you!

In my university, there are many students who live in a student house. But, there are also students who have preferred, for different reasons, to stay in their parents' home. In my opinion, it is better that students live in a student house for different reasons. In this essay I will entail why I believe that student house is a better choice than staying with your parents. Firstly, living on your own is better than living with your parents during your university time, because students who live alone develop skills that they need for their foreseeable future. Living alone means that you have to cook for yourself. Furthermore, living alone makes you notified of what it means to live alone. You are also learning to take decisions properly, because you are aware of your responsibilities. Therefore, you ponder more before taking paramount decisions. Another pivotal lesson of living alone is learning how to manage your money. Most of the students who live alone receive student loans that they can use to pay their rent and for school books. This will enhance the financial knowledge of the students. However, there are many aspects which impede students from living alone during their studies. The cost of living is in many Western countries is increasing considerably. Therefore, many students can't afford to live in a student house. Furthermore, many universities are established in a city where housing is very bad. As a result, many students can't find a student house and are coerced to stay with their parents. To extrapolate, living alone during your university time is a crucial occurrence in your life that will heighten your social and economic ability.

Furthermore, I do my chores every day. I hope to change my life to be more healthy. When I have time I try to do some walking in the park or some yoga in the morning in the backyard of my house. Actually, I like to go to the gym and exercise because all people around me have the same goal. That will give me some power to exercise. As I mentioned before, I like to do yoga because it helps me to breathe deeply and I can get some relaxation from stress and work.

First of all, I would like to say that telling the truth is important and that it can’t be bad in any situation. Furthermore, every moment is totally different and you have to choose for yourselves in all of them. There is no general rule for telling the truth, being silent or lying. I am of the opinion that people should always try to act well and do good. The main question is whether is it sometimes better to tell a lie than the truth. I believe that telling the truth can’t be bad at all, as I said before. Nevertheless, the truth is that you can hurt someone with the truth or cause some problems in relationships etc. For instance, if someone asks you whether he’s fat you might lie to him because you don’t want to hurt him. There is also the option of not saying anything which could be the best decision in many situations. I think that it is always better than a lie because a lie is bad in substance. To put it another way, if you don’t want to answer the question with a lie you should probably not say anything. All things considered, I believe that in situations where you can’t tell the truth you ought to be silent. If it is not possible, than you might lie but only because of a good purpose.

Well, there may be some changes in the school of the future, like in history class there can be virtual reality to see the past in 3D like it was maybe. Also there can be some changes in the way students and teachers interact. Maybe there will be machines that can convert us into holograms to go to school even if we're sick, but some things need to be the same. For example, reading will not disappear. As nowadays most readings are in digital format, books need to be there. Screens produce a lot of blue light that makes us go blind when we use them a lot of time. Also the classroom courses will not disappear because they are the perfect manner to teach students, because we can be sure that they learn something that is not possible in online classes. There can be a lot of ideas to make a better school in the future. Thank you

One of the main skills to develop nowadays is related to being able to communicate properly. This skill not only involves mastering your own language, but includes learning several languages. This is an important factor for toddlers as it is well known that the ability to learn another language is developed in human brains from the early years. For that reason, parents invest a lot of money in their children's education, mainly in bilingual programs. In fact, there are many surveys that correlate learning a foreign language with better opportunities in the future. In a world connected by the internet, there will always be a demand for learning as many new languages as it is possible. Moreover, today more than in the past, to dominate as many languages as possible is a key factor in having a successful career. For that reason, there is a huge demand for website platforms and language teachers, as well as online resources for learning languages. Certainly, today more than ever, we have a huge demand for learning new languages, and because of the advantages of technology and computers, we no longer have excuses for not fulfilling this current demand of being bilingual.

Volunteer work is a type of activity that enables us to realize many good actions towards people or communities around the world. In order to graduate, some high schools ask their students to achieve a certain amount of volunteer work . For example, blood donation, becoming a leader in a youth club, facilitating art workshops, being a positive role model for a young person, and many more. Many students respond positively to this request but others see this demand as a loud and additional charge. For many students, this kind of work enables them to see new horizons and discover their capacities. It is also an occasion for students to explore new social as well as political issues that impact our world. In my opinion, schools shouldn’t impose this requirement because volunteer work must remain volunteering. Furthermore, graduation from school should be the result of personal effort by each student, not conditioned by other activities.

I think medical doctors have fled the countryside hospitals because of the poor working conditions that they are facing in their everyday life at work. The hospitals in the small towns can never be like the big city ones. I believe that the doctors who work in the small hospitals always struggle to have proper medical equipment to do their job so that is one of the big challenges every doctor who works in a small town or village has. They don't have long hours like the doctors in a big city. Working overtime mean you are making more money but that is not the case for the doctor in a little town hospital. That is why they all try work in big city so that they can make a massive fortune. However, the doctors who work in big city hospital always have a lot of opportunities around. They have a big salary and never face any difficulties in their job. To sort this problem out, I think the government need to give equal opportunities to all the hospitals in the country.

Well, in my opinion, it's good to have the same teacher for several years, especially for younger children that often get adapted to a unique way of learning. But for primary and high school students it's better to have a lot of teachers, because a teacher doesn't know everything that a student needs to finish their studies. It's good when you study languages too, because a language has a lot of ways to speak it and it's better to know different accents. In conclusion, it depends on each child, because some children only learn with one teacher, but others learn with a lot of teachers. Also, an important thing are the parents, because when there is only one of them at home, for the child it is easier to learn with one teacher, but when the child grows up with both parents, for him or her it is easier to learn with a lot of teachers. Thank you

I think television entertains and it can also educate. There are an enormous number of TV programs all over the world. Some of them are dramas, movies, music, animation, and so on. Those programs can entertain us. We can enjoy these programs with our family or friends. But there are other TV programs, such as news, documentaries, and so on. These programs can teach us new knowledge and information. Also, there are many educational programs on TV. We can learn many things from these programs. If we join the online university program, we can get a university degree. Recently, we got high-grade technology for interactive communication. If we use this technology on TV, we can communicate with other people directly and simultaneously. It's a surprising situation that we couldn't imagine 5 years ago. We can get direct education from school using this technology. I imagine that TV may have a big capacity to change our lives totally in the future.

Many people think that health and wealth are the two most important things in our lives. Nevertheless, to my mind there is no thing more valuable than our health. Even being rich isn't as important as being healthy. We need to always take care of our health. When we are healthy we can do almost everything. The whole world is open for us. For that reason, when we are healthy we can become rich. Unfortunately, the rich can't be sure that they will be healthy their whole life. Actually, many people think that when they have a lot of money, they are protected from everything. However, they forget that the best things in life are invaluable and they can't buy them. I'm aware of the fact that money can help a healthy lifestyle. However, there are many opportunities to take care of our health. All of this depends on our behavior and attitude. We should remember that we have only one life and we should care of it. Because of all that, I honestly believe that there is no thing more important than our health.

There are two sides to a zoo, there is a good side and there is a bad side. When you think about the children, the families, and the students that go to the zoo every day, they are learning about the animals, they are starting to become interested in the animals, and a zoo gives an opportunity to study many animals too. Moreover, in a zoo there are several species near to extinction, panda bears, for instance. On the other hand, many people think that a zoo is like a prison for animals, and this is cruel. In my opinion, there are zoos and zoos. Many are reasonable for the animals, quite comfortable with spaces similar to wild nature.

In these last few years and especially this year with the Coronavirus pandemic, we saw the following problem: the majority of medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money while there are not enough doctors in many rural areas. Thus one wonders what the reasons for this problem are. Firstly, the majority of medical doctors want to work in cities because they have their friends near them and they can do a lot of activities. In brief, the major advantage is human contact. Secondly, the wages are more attractive in cities than in rural areas. So now we have identified the reasons for this problem, what could we do ? Firstly, we could increase the salary for medical doctors who agree to work in rural areas. We could also regroup all medical doctors who work in rural areas in the same competitiveness hub.

To achieve a high level at university is the purpose for many university students. Some students prefer to live at home with their family during their university studies. This modest choice is dictated by many reasons: on the one hand, these students didn't have enough money to cover university fees; on the other hand, by staying with their family, the students could count on their parents when they face some difficulties. Other students prefer to move away and live on their own when they start their university studies. In many cases, they choose to travel even abroad. This second choice is dictated essentially by their hope to become free and independent. It is also the result of personal maturity and an open-minded spirit. To sum up, both of these two strategies are valid and defensible. The most important thing is indeed how to mobilize effectively all the means on their own in order to achieve their goal.

Hello Teacher, There are a lot of changes that have happened since the day you suggested Write and Improve to me, and because of that English has become my favourite subject. There are many options to use in the Write and Improve program and one of the best feature of this program is its analytics. Whenever you attempt a task in a workbook , a very beautifully designed feedback algorithm suggests feedback and areas to improve upon. There are many levels present in this program, from beginner to advanced writing. One can create or join a workbook, which is also one of the nice features . It is surprising to see that all the features that are in this program are absolutely free. It means no one needs to pay a penny for this program. One of the things I don't like about this program is the website interface, I mean it can be good but this has no effect on learning with this program. Thank you teacher for suggesting this wonderful program and I'll suggest all my classmates join this program. It is for everyone, whether you know English or not.

There can be many thoughts on this topic, but I personally feel that teachers should be changed every year because that's how life works. You'll not always get a chance to work with the same people. We need to get out of our comfort zone and that's how life goes. We need to interact with different people so that we can understand a maximum number of people's thought processes and get a chance to learn something from others' experience. This goes for teachers also. We need to get used to learning from different individuals so that we can make a good thought system. For example, if we go for a particular topic in a particular reference book, one reference book says something in one way and another in a different way, but in the end we get to know about two ways to approach a particular problem. Teachers also teach us different approaches to solve a particular problem. And that is what counts at the end and the way it should be.

As a child everyone learns to tell the truth all the time. But is it the right option to do it every time without exceptions? I think that lies always come up. At first you think that lying can be convenient. But often it has the same scenario: you begin with a little lie about something unimportant, but with time it grows bigger and bigger and in the end it will burst, because it is impossible to think about every detail and to remember everything you had ever said. For example you lie to your friend about being sick, so you cannot go to his party. Then you have to think out what kind of sickness it is, where it came from, how long you have had this and so on. And at some particular point your lies will break down. And you have a big argument with your friend about everything you said to him that was not true. But, on the other hand, if you tell everyone the truth, you cannot live in a community. Sometimes you have to lie in order to be polite. To be honest with everyone about everything will cause a lot of trouble. For example if your fellow asks you how you like her dress, it will be polite to say that it is good instead of telling her the truth that you do not like her look. In summary, I think that the question about when you have to be honest and when not is a very complex topic.

There no doubt that these days writing is becoming very popular. However, the question is, "Is it important to learn to write? It is considerably controversial today. Nowadays, learning with technology is a lot easier than it was.

In my experience, to improve my writing skills I was using the Write&Improve website to practise writing in English.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? This question might reflect what some teachers think. Well, of course, both options have advantages and disadvantages. Of course, I think that idea is not correct. We need libraries so that we can improve ourselves and they are beneficial for our health. Well, firstly, the advantage of using computers and tablets. Using the internet is the easiest way to search for information. And it is also very agile! But if you depend on it too much, you will get addicted to it. And if you get addicted to the internet, it is very difficult to get back to normal. Looking at the screen can also be very bad for your eyes! And if you look at the screen too much, it will affect your health. Secondly, the advantages of using books. Using books may be slow and things may be hard to find, but it is the best way to learn! You can improve your reading skills and your comprehension skills. And of course, your eyes won't get as bad as when using computers or tablets.

Going to university is a new big step in everyone´s life and a lot of freshman students think that they are only students when they move out of their parents´ house. But is it really so? I think that nowadays it is common that young people rent their own flat or room when they begin their education in the university. And this often has a good explanation: not every city has universities and not every university has the same directions. For example, if you want to study biotechnology, you will have to go to university which offers suitable courses. And if this university is in another city, your best option is to move to this place. Now, with mobility being more convenient, it is easier to get to another city and it is becoming normal that everyone moves out for study. But, on the other hand, if you need less than an hour to your study place by train or bus from your parents´ house, I do not think that it is necessary for you to change your flat. Staying at your parents´place you can save a lot of money and it is very convenient to have your mum who does your laundry and cooks food for you. In summary, I think that you do not have to move out without good reasons, because not through changing your flat do you become a real student.

There is no doubt that these days all teachers have a positive effect on education and students' learning, but it is difficult to choose one answer to this question. However, the question is, "Is changing teachers every year a good choice for students ?" Actually, my personal opinion is if students need a teacher to stay and teach them that means they prefer to study with the teachers who already know them. Also, it depends on the students if they do not want the same teacher and they want to study with another teacher. Sometimes, if the teachers change every year it makes the students worry about the subject and the teacher's character . That maybe will affect their understanding and their scores. As we can see , it is difficult to choose one answer depending on just one opinion. Also, we cannot deny the benefits of changing teachers every year because definitely every teacher has a different way to teach his students.

Recently, surfing the Internet, I discovered Write and Improve, which is an online platform to improve English writing. Write and Improve is a very useful tool, because it offers the possibility to practise English for free. It is very inclusive because every English learner can use it, regardless of their level. There are exercises both for those who are beginning and for those who already speak Enlgish pretty well. In this way, everyone can follow a personal path and choose their own goals to achieve. In fact, there are areas with exercises to get several English Certifications, such as IELTS Academics or B2 First. Write and Improve is so useful because writings can be checked in real time by the algorithm that it is based on. Mistakes, both lexical and spelling, are individuated in real time so that the student can correct them immediately. Moreover, yellow highlights incorrect sentences, by using two different shades: the lighter one is for those sentences which have a few mistakes in their constructions, the darker one is for those sentences which are completely wrong. This part is probably the only one of Write and Improve which should really be improved: it would be very helpful if, after highlighting an incorrect sentence, it suggested a way to make it better and more fluid. Despite this little defect, Write and Improve is an optimal tool to improve English and I strongly recommend using it to every English learner, from the beginners to the advanced ones.

It is proven scientifically that exercise is important for our health. However, there are other things that are more important than only doing exercise. Our health is affected severely by external stimuli that cause us stress, anxiety, and depression. So, exercise can enhance our health effectively. However, exercise alone can never be the solution towards a healthy lifestyle. Because at the end of the day, each and every one of us is looking for peace of mind. That's why we need to have practices that make us stay happy all day. In addition, our day should be full of various activities, so that we do not get bored. For example, having time to go out with friends for fun is a very important thing that boosts our peace of mind. Furthermore, taking up a new hobby like singing, playing the piano, or doing yoga (all are amusing activities) promotes our mental and physical health. Eating healthy food is essential for our health; because we are what we eat. Adopting a healthy lifestyle might be difficult for some people, but we need to think about the physical and psychological consequences of not adopting a healthy lifestyle.

There is no doubt that these days the Write&Improve website is becoming very popular. However, the question is: does this website really help the students to improve their writing or not? It is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay I am going to examine this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of this argument there are people who are argue that the considerable benefits outweigh the disadvantages. To illustrate, the main reason for believing this is the Write & improve website has a lot of tools which are perfect to help students to write from the beginning because there are four levels for writing. The first level is for beginners and then to intermediate and finally for advanced and business. The first level , which is for beginners, includes some questions which make the students think about the answer and write it in an easy way. Moreover, this website has some parts to prepare for the IELTS test. The second point of this argument some people argue that the website is profitable, and it provides some amounts for writing and after that you have to pay to complete your progress in writing. Furthermore, they request a high fee to let the learner to improve his or her writing. As we have seen, there is no one easy answer to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that this website is so good to help all students to improve their writing skills.

The first aspect to point out is, all around the world, people are spending more and more time doing sedentary activities. During their leisure time, people like to sit on sofas, watching TV, playing games or just socializing with others. The problem is that many children follow their parents' example and that can give them diseases. One solution for this problem is to convince kids to do sports activities. To begin with, an extremely important place where you understand aspects about life and gain knowledge to help in materializing your future is school. But school should provide more physical activities for kids to take part in. For instance, children spend on average six hours in school every day while students can stay at school for eight hours. That is a lot of time just to sit on a chair and listen to someone. Children are getting bored as the time passes and they do not pay attention anymore to what the teacher is saying. Secondly, sports activities not only are good to increase attention, but also they reduce high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and feelings of depression and anxiety. For example, one of my acquaintances had problems with anxiety and his therapist recommended him to do exercises and take walks. That worked for him and now he is really fond of sports activities. Those activities made him one of the happiest people I have ever known. On the other hand, there are kids who feel uncomfortable when they are doing exercises in front of other children. Some are often rude and make fun of other's bodies and that can cause self-esteem problems. However, I believe that the results of doing exercises are worth it and you can make the best of it, despite rude people. To conclude, physical activities are a necessity in order to feel good, be healthy and look good. More people should do sport because it is wholesome and they will have many advantages after doing that.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I found this requirement absolutely appropriate, because it highlights a problem which most times is too underestimated: the one of social activism. We are used to doing things in order to receive something back, but sometimes things must be done just because they are right. In a society that wants to call itself civil, people must help others without asking for something in return. Helping just to help, without any other purpose, is a wonderful way to make the personal cultural luggage of everyone grow up. Volunteer work offers the possibility to meet people with different experiences, perhaps coming from other countries or from families with difficult conditions, or to care about animal which had unluckily been adopted by the wrong person. It also offers the opportunity to understand different ways of living and to become aware of the problems that the community has. You can also volunteer by cleaning plastic on the beaches or organizing charity events to raise funds for associations in the area. There are several possibilities to do something good for the community and this is a very relevant point, because everyone can help according to their attitudes. Volunteer work also allows people to learn to be less selfish, which is not so obvious in our days, and that no one nor nothing has to be left behind.

I have been learning English for more than 20 years but I have never seen any website for learning English writing which has a feature as good as 'Write and Improve' before. With this website, you can practise writing anywhere if you have a mobile phone or a tablet. There are a ton of essay topics divided into 3 different levels which students can study by themselves. After finishing writing, essays are checked to find any error by the AI, therefore, they are evaluated and are given feedback in only a few seconds. If the students have corrected their writing, the graph will show the improvement compared with the previous one. However, there are some problems I found while I was using this website. First, the fonts are too small and the background colour is too bright. Second, I would suggest that the feedback should be more specific to each writing error because it is hard to find what the writers do wrong by themselves without direct hints. All in all, I would like to recommend this website to you, readers. You cannot find any other websites which give you the great opportunity to improve your English without any fee. I believe that this website will gradually be better and become a promising way to learn writing.

I think it wasn't important to learn and speak a foreign language in the past, because it wasn't really important to get a job, or money, and not a lot of professions needed to speak other languages. But now, I think it is important these days, because to get a job you now have to speak another language. And if you want to be a flight attendant you need to know more languages, or when your work involves travel, you have to communicate with other people and you have to know languages to know what people from another country are telling you. And also, you can be smarter knowing more languages. That is why I think it wasn't important to speak other languages in the past, but now in the present I think it's more important to speak more languages to get a job.

Learning English Hello. My name is Sam and I am 14 years old. I am from Myanmar and our traditional language is Burmese. When we went to school, we learned English. I always wanted to study English because it is an international language and you can use it everywhere, like in every country. Also, there are many benefits of English. The English language can be used in the business community, the technological field, education, and social life. In business English can be very useful when a company builds a cooperation with another international company from another country. In technology, all electronic devices use English for computing and the internet. In education, an international student should have the ability to speak, write, and read English. As for social life, people will continuously interact with each other in various aspects of social life. Also, English is important to me because when I become an adult I will build a company and a community with other people. That's all.

Every invention comes with both pros and cons. If we are focusing only on one part of an invention then it will cause serious problems in the future. Video games were invented to provide fun for digital device users and if we go from past to present the journey is quite remarkable and the way video games have developed is appreciable. Now, the video games market is growing so fast and is so vast that they are making games in all genres and soon they will replace movies. They are providing us a real - life but virtual reality experience. Now the negative part is that they are being used widely by teenagers and these video games are quite addictive and aggressive. Certain games are so violent that they make a deep impact on one's mind. If I have to choose between the pros and cons of video games , I'll go with supporting video games. Yes, there is no doubt that video games are impactful, but we cannot deny their pros either. Many teenagers take inspiration from video games and make their own video games at a very young age which is very progerssive for future generations. When Oppenheimer invented the nuclear weapon for the first time, he was very happy about the revolutionary invention until it was misused by the USA and his nuclear bomb was used on Japan. But this doesn't mean the nuclear bomb was bad and it should have been banned at that time. A positive approach was taken and the nuclear concept was used for the creation of clean energy.

Yes, zoos are a great place for people to learn and see true nature, which we have been missing from our daily life since we moved towards technologies. A great place for animals to live is their own home, but this logic was valid some decades ago. Today, the scenario is totally different from what it was before and there is no home left for animals to live in . Because of our so-called development we cut down trees and we made the soil infertile . So there is no natural home left for animals to live in. Even if they live in their home they are fighting for their survival. So it is better to take these animal into zoos so that they can be taken care of. Yes, it is true that they will become weak as they are getting food from humans , they are not hunting. Many endangered species are kept in zoos so that they can be protected from hunters. People also get to know about these animals so that there can be an awareness about the extinction of animals.

There is a trend among students to pursue a higher degree in other countries, which is good because one's getting a chance to learn in a different education system. Since this trend is at its very peak , we need to know the advantages and disadvantages of going abroad for a higher degree. Some of the advantages of going abroad are a better education, more chances of getting jobs there, more opportunities, etc. Yes, it is true that most of the students who are going abroad do so because of a better education system. More job opportunities are also a major reason for this migration. Some of the disadvantages of going abroad are cultural differences, feeling lonely, etc. Cultural differences between two countries are a major issue faced by students living abroad. There are fewer people that they know and in time of an emergency it is difficult to get help since they are not in their native country. There has also been a lot news coming in about discrimination in recent times. The native people of that place feel insecure because they are losing job opportunities and university places are grabbed by foreign students.

Nowadays, with social networks and cellphones, we have forgotten how important television has been for many years. This machine appeared in the 1960's and it has helped us a lot. Firstly, the main purpose of TV is communicating and keeping people notified. Moreover, programs such as the daily news or travelling programs develop intelligence. Besides, you can change the audio and consequently learn to listen to other languages. However, social networks show a different content. Secondly, our lives have been changed by TV since thousands of people work for television. Moreover, now we can enjoy more communicative elements . Therefore, humanity has grown significantly in development. Finally, during these months of the pandemic, TV has helped children to watch video classes and educative programs. Although many people think watching many hours of TV will harm kids, it is true that it can help us much more than we think. I genuinely think that without television, people wouldn't have ever progressed like they actually did. What is more, technologies like smartphones and iPads follow a similar mechanism as TV.

It's located in the southeastern region of Viet Nam and it has lots of interesting things. We visited the Pig Hill, Statue of Christ the King, etc. Then, we went to the beach. It's the favorite part of the trip. It was also the first time that I had been to Vung Tau so I enjoyed the trip so much. What about you, Billal? Did you go anywhere?

Dear Sir/Madam, I would like to share with you my thoughts about the town council's plan of banning mobile phones in public places like shops and restaurants. In my humble opinion, such a ban has much more drawbacks than positive aspects. I am aware of the fact that nowadays people's lifestyles rely on mobile phones and it is indisputable that in some cases we very clearly overuse them. Therefore some people claim that this may lead to pretty serious consequences like an inability to understand social interactions. It seems to me that these are extremely rare situations so I believe we should not count it as a solid reason to implement the above-mentioned ban. There are also opinions that using mobile phones can disturb other passengers on the buses or clients in the restaurants and the shops. Undoubtedly we could find examples of such situations but I think it is too much generalisation. I strongly believe that most people know how to behave in a way that does not hassle other human beings, even if they acquire a mobile phone. In summary, I do not find that there are sufficient reasons to claim that a ban on mobile phones in public places is necessary. Some people might dislike modern devices, but it is still not enough to limit the liberty of others. We should live according to the rule live and let live.

Well, in my opinion computers and tablets aren't going to replace books, especially in poor countries where not all students know how to use a laptop or a tablet, but books can be less common than today because at least 3 million people know how to use electronic appliances and those people can use books less frequently. There is a big problem with e-books too, and that problem is that some people upload a book in digital format for no money and the writers and publishing companies don't get money for their books and that is a problem that with physical books is less common. In conclusion, physical books will never disappear from our world because books help us in a lot of things that digital books can't help us with, but they can be less common in the future.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. No one can deny that health is wealth. The ways of taking care of one's health have sparked a great controversy among people of all walks of life. Some of them hold the view that being in a state of good health is a treasure of life, but some of them believe that wealth is more important than health as money is the most vital thing for life. As Albert once said, "Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory." This quote truly proves that being healthy is happiness in our life. Thus, we should find out the reason why being healthy is more significant than being rich. As far as I am concerned, the dominant reason why being healthy is more important can be proved through the old saying, "prevention is better than cure." No doubt, someone will suffer from severe disease if they do not take good care of their health, say, they will pay a heavy price for not taking care of their health. For example, although we are billionaires, we still cannot "buy health" as we wish and finally we still need to face death. From another view of point, it is undeniable that money is necessary for everyone to live a life as the world is about nothing but money. However, can money really buy everything for us including health? Perhaps not. We can cite an example of this point. For instance, a piece of news which just happened a month ago, a young man suffered a heart attack when he continued his work late at midnight at his office. It is earth-shattering news which makes the public aware of taking good care of their health besides working. In a nutshell, I think that being healthy is more important than being rich in life. I hope everyone would keep in mind that " life is only once, make it worth it.." Needless to say, health is wealth.

Computers and tablets shouldn't replace books. Instead of that, they ought to be used as complementary resources for education. Firstly, we would have a huge problem. Students would spend too much time on their screen. Nowadays, we are already used to using our phones, computers, or tablets at least once a day. More than that, studying on screens would definitely spoil our eyes and our brains. That was the first reason. Secondly, they would have many inequalities in education. I don't think that the governments of all countries would agree to pay for all these products. That means the families themselves would have to use a huge amount of money to support the education of their children. So that wouldn't be fair. That's why I think that.

There is no doubt that these days video games are becoming very popular with children. However, the question is, are they useful for children? It is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of video games considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that video games assist children in learning new skills and focusing on achieving the goal from the games at the end. Additionally, video games create a competition between children to do their best and win. On the other hand, there are people who believe that video games are not beneficial and they have a negative effect on children. To illustrate, children spend a long time playing without stopping, which is not healthy for them . As we have seen, there is no one easy answer to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that video games are a good choice of entertainment for children, but parents must be careful about what their children play.

Well, zoos are places where there are a lot of animals, it's a good idea to be in contact with animals and learn about them. But the animals don't have to be in the place, because they want to be free. Because for centuries animals were in the jungle and other places around the earth, and only 20,000 years ago humans appeared. That is a very short time compared to other species. And being in a zoo can be stressful too for an animal because being outside is necessary for everyone. If a human is only 50 days at home he is stressed, imagine an animal being somewhere all his or her life without leaving a place. In conclusion, zoos are good places to learn about animals, but the animals need to move. An alternative is to make a zoo that for every day in a cage they can be out. That's a great idea.

Music is often said not to be an important subject at school, but I could not disagree more. In this writing I am going to present my reasons for thinking so. It goes without saying that music is one of the oldest forms of communication. No matter what your mother tongue may be, everyone can understand the message that every piece of music keeps within. Another point to bear in mind is that you can develop your creativity by learning music, especially when it comes to playing an instrument. By learning how to play an instrument, not only can you more fully comprehend the universal language of music, but you will also value and understand better the effort it requires to play. In my humble opinion, everyone should learn how difficult it is to compose music, as music is one of the oldest languages created by human beings and it will always be a part of our development as a species. We can also learn so much about our own history as we learn and understand how music changes over the years. Last but by no means least, I feel that art subjects should have the same importance that the rest of the subjects have. In summary, I feel that some changes must be made as far as school education is concerned to allow people who are interested in creative subjects to have more opportunities to develop their skills.

Studying abroad is an opportunity for students to explore new lands with different cultures and traditions. It is also a chance to discover new horizons in life, which ultimately adds to our life experience. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. Here are some of the advantages of studying abroad: Recently, studying abroad has become a very popular speech that raised by young people due to the fact that global universities now offer a variety of programs and courses at low costs. Furthermore, studying abroad broadens students' mentality, because they'll have the chance to live on their own away from their families for some time, which in turn enables them to cope with the challenges they could face. In addition to that, getting to know people from different cultural backgrounds is a valuable opportunity to learn so many new things. Although students may step out of their comfort zone and there might be some sort of culture shock, eventually students will get used to it and start to love their new study destinations. Students usually choose to study abroad to get quality education so that they can get into a good career in the future. However, one of the disadvantages of studying abroad is the fact that young people may be prone to some problems because of their young age if they are studying alone overseas away from family. But recently universities and colleges have arranged specific types of accommodation for such young people by putting them under the guardianship of a local family - and that's very good. Another one of the disadvantages as some people think is the process of acculturation, because some people prefer not to assimilate into new cultures, and they prefer to keep theirs only. Finally, studying abroad is full of treasures!

Hundreds of years ago, travel was very difficult for people, due to the fact that means of transportation were not as available compared to the world of today. In addition, travel at the time might not be as important as today because people had everything that they needed. But with the Industrial Revolution, new means of transportation were invented, such as aeroplanes, cars, and modern ships. Therefore, travel has become easier and more accessible to everyone. As a consequence, that has opened new opportunities for people to discover new lands and start global businesses, which has led to the globalisation that we witness nowadays. Furthermore, with the increasing scientific progress and technological advances in sciences like computer engineering and astronomy, much more possibilities were recognised, such as space exploration. Nowadays, people need to travel to other countries for diverse reasons, such as business, education, immigration, tourism, etc. So, in my opinion, I think the future of travel is very promising as long as we see a very thriving global economy as well as a thriving education and immigration sector. Hundreds of years ago, people would not have imagined the travel possibilities we have now. Similarly, travel can definitely change.

First of all, I would like to say that I haven’t worked in any kind of office or workstation. That means that I have no experience with it and I can write only my own opinion. I believe that there are some basic things which affect the efficiency of the employees. For instance, these are a good environment, a good purpose for the work and also fun in the work. Based on that, I think that the good employer should take care of these things in the first place. The basic question is whether the employees should work together in open places or in some closed cubicles. In my opinion, both have some pros and cons. In open places you have no privacy and you are under pressure. On the other hand, in small cubicles you have no space and you will feel probably very uncomfortable. I believe that there is a better way. The best option would be to have a private office for every employee. All things considered, I would like better to have privacy and work in small space with walls, but I wouldn’t be happy about it.

Learning A New Language Hello, my name is Sam and I am 14 years old. I live in Myanmar and I am Burmese. I always wanted to learn a new language and one that was used internationally. That's why I learn English. Starting to learn a new language is hard for everyone. I have learned English for 10 years and now I can speak, write, and read English very well. Learning a foreign language is important these days. For example, for a pilot, company manager, and so on. Learning the English language is necessary in those jobs. In the past, we didn't need to learn a new language, but in the 20th century if you want a job with a high salary, you must learn a new language. Must-learn languages are English, Korean, Japanese, and so on. English is a must-learn language and it is used internationally. That's all about learning a new language.

There are a positive side and a negative side if a student decides to go to study abroad. First, it is not easy. We have a good side to this, the student will be more independent and he will make more effort. In my opinion, this is very important for growth. On the other hand, some problems can happen, like depression and difficulty with the adaptation. The habits and customs must be different and many people can't adapt. Another problem is the costs, many times the decision to study abroad needs to consider the cost of living in a different country. The majority of Brazilian students want to study in the United States or Europe, and the dollar and euro are very strong, so it can be very expensive. However, this experience can open opportunities to work in the future, and it is very interesting to learn a new language. Finally, if a student has this opportunity he shouldn't lose it, because it is an experience for their whole life; to get to know new people and a new culture.

It goes without saying that studying abroad is something everybody should do if they have the opportunity to do it . Here, in this essay, I am going to present the advantages and disadvantages of that matter. To start with, I would like to mention some advantages and how satisfactory spending time and studying abroad could be for anyone. First of all, studying abroad you will not only discover some new places and environments, but you will also be involved in a culture which can be very different from yours. No matter if you stay for a long period or not, being immersed in such situations is always a great lesson in life, as long as you are disposed to be part of this experience. If this is the case, you will get several new skills, such as speaking another language, understanding other lifestyles, and being able to adapt yourself to events you would not face in your own country. Nevertheless, studying in a different country could also be stressful, especially when it comes to speaking another language which is not your mother tongue. In that way, you may need some help, if you happen not to know how to express yourself in that language. Food and weather conditions can undoubtedly be a problem too, above all, if you go to a place where you will surely find the complete opposite of what you are used to dealing with at home. However, these disadvantages can be lowered just by acquiring the proper information about the country you are planning to go to. Last but by no means least, I would like to add that the whole experience resulting from living abroad will definitely make a more mature and responsible person of you.

WRITE AND IMPROVE: A marvellous TOOL When it comes to resources and tools for learning languages, it is often said that it is hard to find the right ones to reach the aim you have pointed to. But, I have to admit that I was greatly surprised by the one called 'Write and improve' from the very moment that I started to use it. No matter if you have a good level or not, this tool already mentioned gives you the opportunity to test your brain, correct your mistakes, and, what is more, it shows you your errors at once. That makes it enormously useful, since one can have a result in a matter of seconds. Another utility worth mentioning is the classification it makes of your mistakes, by using different colours to separate important mistakes from the ones which are not. Therefore, this innovative tool cannot be described any other way but useful. And, speaking from my personal experience, once you start using it, your motivation rises, especially if you are rewarded with a good mark. I would like to end up by recommending the use of this tool to everyone who is concerned about writing in English. I would not be exaggerating if I say that you will find the benefit of using 'Write and improve' from the very beginning.

Hi Tim, How are you? I hope you are doing fine. I told you in my last email that I was going to a concert of the Danish pop-musician Christopher. Finally, the concert was yesterday evening in Bremen. I was so happy when I arrived at the stadium where he played. It was so amazing to listen to him live. He was really good. I knew all the song lyrics and sang the whole time. Today, I don't have any voice ha ha . My favourite song was "Heartbeat," because it was so emotional. All the flashlights and candles burned. I got goosebumps then. I really advice you to go to such a concert, especially one of Christopher, before he gets too famous and you can't afford the tickets anymore. I hope you are doing well and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Love, Natalie

Those who have spent hundreds of hours on learning a non-native language are fully aware that sooner or later we all need some additional resources that would enable us to brush up on our skills more easily. I have always struggled with writing, therefore I was looking for some website on which could help me to improve. After a while I finally found Write and Improve. In my humble opinion this website can really help you to develop. After signing up you should choose a level from a beginner to an advanced or pick an exam that you are preparing for. Then you will get all the topics for paragraphs, essays, articles and reports which are available. When your exercise is finished, you can check it. The level of your writing will be assessed and all your misspelling or errors will be pointed out. After that you are able to correct your mistakes and once again check your writing. There is only one drawback on this website that I noticed. One of the sentences in your exercise might be highlighted as incorrect, but you will not get any advice on how you ought to rephrase it. Nevertheless, that is rather a small inconvenience. To top off, it seems to me that everyone can find Write and Improve as extremely useful resource for learning English. I highly recommend it.

From time to time we asked ourselves very deep and complex questions about our existence. One of those inquiries is whether we would like to live calmly for 100 years or rather shortly but more intensely. I must admit that is extremely difficult conundrum, since both options have some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, a calm, long life seems very peaceful and I would not be taken aback if many people pick that possibility. After all, most of us desire some small home with our beloved family members. Furthermore, everyone wants to delay their death as far as possible. This type of life undoubtedly will suit anyone who does not have enormous ambitions. On the other hand, the life mentioned above might be quite mundane and obviously we all want to take part in some kind of adventures occasionally. For me, living intensely means having successful career, being well off and taking part in lots of enjoyable events with my friends and family. Having said that, I am pretty sure that in general those are examples of most popular life goals of any person. The only disadvantage of this option is this short amount of time which we are given, but after some consideration I think that still positive aspects outweigh drawbacks in this scenario. To top off, although a calm and long life seems quite convincing, it seems that I would prefer to live shortly but much more intensely, because I do not want to lose any given opportunity or have any regrets at the end of my life.

Hi Laeyla, I'm so sorry that I couldn't go to your birthday party, the reason is that I had some troubles with my car, the motor broke down and I ended up in the middle of nowhere.

Offices tend to have two types of workstations for employees. In one of them workers are secluded from others, while in the second kind no walls separate them from each other. As usual, these two situations have both some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, people might be prepared to work in open workstations, because they are surrounded by other co-workers, who are likely their friends or acquaintances. That may lead to creation of a pleasant atmosphere at work. For that reason employees might enjoy their work, which would result in them being much more efficient. Furthermore, if someone had any difficulty with their work, then it would not be hard to ask for help since other co-workers would be next to him. On the other hand, I must admit that there are some people who prefer to work on their own. The presence of other people might only disturb them, which would impact on their performance. Moreover, I strongly believe that enclosed workstations or cubicles are much quieter, which also may enable employees to focus more on their work. To top off, it seems to me that answer to our main question depends on particular workers' personality. For employees who like to be surrounded by other people, open workstations would be more suitable, whereas for people who can be described as lone wolves, it would not be most optimal choice so they should work in enclosed workstations.

It is true that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. And I used to go with my family to the national zoo in my country, and they were really amazing moments. We saw various wild animals and it was a great experience for me. However, some people believe animals belong in nature and shouldn't be kept in zoos. It is right perhaps, especially when we think of it in the context of freedom that all animals should have, the freedom to live in nature where they belong. Keeping animals in zoos is not only a way of entertainment, but also a chance for the caretakers of the animals to look after the sick animals for whom it may be difficult to survive alone in nature because of predation. Furthermore, veterinarians carry out scientific research on animals to better understand animal diseases and why they arise and how to prevent or treat these diseases. That's why animals may be kept in zoos for such studies. I think it makes sense to keep animals in zoos as long as this achieves promising scientific outcomes as well as entertainment. Nevertheless, I still see animal confinement as sort of suppressing their freedom. So, it is highly recommended that animal-protection authorities provide safe zoos with a suitable environment so that animals can still feel satisfied while they are being kept in zoos. In my opinion, animal care should be given importance because they are an essential part of the ecosystem that we live in. So, protecting animals is protecting our ecosystem. In conclusion, I would say animals may be kept in zoos for entertainment, scientific research purposes, and care. Apparently, if there is no way to release all the animals in zoos into nature, we need to be mindful to give better care.

Since globalisation, people have undergone many changes in their lives, and specifically in their speaking. Hitherto, individuals did not travel as much as we do currently. Travel is part of our lives, and people increasingly need to speak different languages just to better understand the needs of foreigners. In fact, we are all connected and we need to engage in discussions and negotiations. If a person doesn't have the ability to integrate and speak at least one foreign language, it will be difficult to negotiate properly and to follow what is going on. It is important nowadays, because companies are going more global, and to succeed employees must know how to speak a language other than their native one. It is important also, because at present we are doing international business with foreigners. Before, it was not mandatory to speak several languages because we could still trade with local companies and therefore speak our native language.

My reasons for learning English. I learn English for many reasons. I learn English because I really want to master the language. I really like English, it's one of my favourite languages. I also would like to visit countries where they speak English, like the U. S. A and England, to practise my English with the people there. It is important to learn English, because in my school when we are like 12 years old, we go to England to compete against other schools from other countries, and when I go there to compete I want to win for my school and family. It is also important, because one day I want to create a movie company were we animate characters, and I hope I can speak clearly to all the people that speak English in my company. That is why I want to learn all about English.

Dear Sir and Madam, I read in the newspaper from 1 August that a new law about banning mobile phones in the public places is now being discussed. Therefore I would like to tell you about the dependence between people´s lifestyle and mobile phones. Nowadays you can not do anything without your gadget. People are not only having contact with each other through it, but they have their whole lives in it. Banning mobile phones in all public places will mean that tourists will have no opportunities to take pictures of sights. It will also be more complex for them to find the right way in an unknown city without maps on their devices. In the shops and restaurants you will have another problem. In addition, nowadays you can even pay with your phone and without having a credit card. By banning mobile phones this innovation can not be used, although it is very convenient. Going to the shop people also always write a list with purchases on their phones. I can understand that people sometimes pay more attention to their gadgets than to real life. But I think that they have to be taught to act in another way and not by a ban. In my opinion prohibiting mobile phones in all public places will only displease people, because they are accustomed to convenient mobile phones which are now a big part of our life. With best regards, Someone

Music has had an enormous impact on our lives throughout history, therefore some people claim that it should be taught at school and even students should be obliged to learn to play a musical instrument. In my humble opinion that would not be beneficial to everyone, so such lessons ought not to be obligatory. It seems to me that the most crucial purpose of a school curriculum is to give children vast knowledge of most important subjects like mathematics or biology and I am not completely convinced that music is such a subject. I think that students should choose to spend their time on other activities, which might turn out to be more useful to them. Furthermore, some people may not even like to learn to play an instrument. For that reason, they might start to perceive those music lessons as some type of chore and as a result they would learn very ineffectively. Moreover, no one would argue that learning how to play a musical instrument correctly takes even years, so again that would consume quite a large part of students' free time, which they might use in more beneficial way. To top off, I strongly believe that studying music ought not to be compulsory for everyone. I agree on the other hand that if some students want to attend additional music classes, then they should have this possibility.

Studying at a university undoubtedly brings a lot of changes to people's lives. Some students even start to live on their own, while others stay with their family at home. In my humble opinion, both options have some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, living on your own you can, without a doubt, obtain useful practical skills or experience. Moreover, you, for sure, will become more adult and independent. What is more, moving out of your family home to another city might give you opportunity to attend a more prestigious university. That may particularly concern students who live in small cities or in the countryside. On the other hand, choosing to stay at your family home is probably in all cases much less expensive than this other alternative, because you do not need to worry about the cost of accommodation. Additionally, unless you stay at home, it might be necessary to take up a part-time job to earn some money in order to pay for your new house or for meals. Furthermore, some students might not feel comfortable in another city with lots of unfamiliar people and that might need the support of their family. For them it may be more convenient not to move out. To top off, it seems to me that we all, sooner or later, will move out from our family house. For that reason, I believe that not staying at home is a far better option, especially if you want to attend a university which is not situated in your town.

I, with all of my family, went to our hotel room. It was comfortable and we passed some time there. The next day, we went to the historic centre of Mexico City, there were lots of interesting things from the Aztec culture, then we started travelling to a lot of places. The next day we went to Teothihuacan, it was very big. When we decided to return, I had had a very good experience being outside of my country for the first time. It was the best holiday ever, because I learnt a lot of things, I had a good time with my family.

Usually, I have free time at the weekends, but I also have free time in the afternoon. In the afternoon, I usually fold up some clothes or clean the bathroom, living room, kitchen and so on. But, at night, I usually watch some series like "The Rain," "The Umbrella Academy," and so on. Sometimes, I'm into listening to music or watching videos on YouTube. I broke my phone's screen, but I'm thankful for having a cellphone because I can play games on it. At the weekends, I usually relax or I try to read a book.

This is a great issue to discuss. Healthy or wealthy? Both have different advantages and also disadvantages. But will healthy mean wealth? Or will wealthy mean healthy? For me, being healthy is more important than being wealthy. Being healthy means we can productively do any activity. Healthy means we are far from illness. Healthy means we don't need to consume medicine daily. Healthy means we have a great metabolism in our body. There is an argument saying that being rich can make us stay healthy. It is probably right when you have money, you can access health services more easily than if you have a lack of money. However, that is not true, you can access health facilities easily, but money cannot cure your illness. Although you have a lot of money, you cannot make your illness disappear so suddenly. So, for me, being healthy is more important than being rich. Being healthy can make us work productively and that is enough to fulfill our daily needs.

There is no doubt that most people want to work in the best place to get higher money or salary. Medical doctors , for example, are some of these people who want to work in a city or country which pays them a high salary. In my opinion, they have freedom to work where they want because they study hard and they spend a lot of time and effort to achieve their goals to be in a good place in the end. I totally agree there are a lot of areas which do not have enough doctors due to inappropriate situations and circumstances, such as a low salary or a lack of life requirements. To solve these problems, the government have to afford to pay doctors high salaries and meet their needs because that will encourage many doctors to move and live in these areas. Finally, I have given my opinion about the topic and, of course, the doctors who decide what is the best for their life.

Some parents worry about a negative impact, but video games have some positive effects on their children. Video games are very popular with children. They can make friends by talking about games and playing them. It is not different from a playground or playing games among children. They can communicate with each other to share an experience. Children can get fulfillment when they complete a game. Mark, he is my cousin, likes to play games. He said that he couldn't concentrate enough without playing games in his childhood. " It might not be a good example, but the fulfillment of completing games gave me confidence," he said. There are many types of games nowadays. Some games can allow children the opportunity to communicate with other worlds. For example, online chess games are a little different from face-to-face games. However, it is not easy to play chess if children do not have friends who can play chess. Video games are just one approach to communicate with other worlds. Some games have a negative impact on children. However, there are some positive effects of playing video games. If parents understand the details and good points of the games, they can use it positively.

It is not as important to be healthy as it is to be rich. When you are rich, you have money and you can afford a lot of things to make your life better, like food, clean water, a house to live in, medicine... That money can make your life better. If you are unhealthy, you can go to hospital and ask the doctor for a cure or medicine and that could make you healthy again. You can access a lot of things and your life will be good. People say you can live over 70 years with money, but then in your 80s and 90s have no money. If you have no money you can't afford food, clean water, and medicine so you can be unhealthy because of that. Another reason is you have to work to get money and it will be difficult to work. If you are old then you won't be strong enough to work for money.

Exercise is very important, and it's necessary for us. Healthy living is not only a diet, it is a habit, mixing healthy food and exercise. You need at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. There are things that are not important, but you think they are. For example, you can watch TV later, it's better to spend that time doing exercise. Now that there are lots of streaming platforms, there is no problem losing a chapter of your series. Another thing that some people say that is very important is spending time with friends, (most commonly for men) and that's not true, you can spend that time doing exercise. Now there are many options to be comunicated free, and that's good, so you don't need to spend time on things that are not important in our lives. So if you do exercise and eat healthy food, you can feel better.

The radio, television, internet, etc. have emerged in different decades and with the improvement of technology. If you have the conception that the basic principle of all means of communication is to spread a fact or an idea, and into that there is an opinion, it's possible to conclude that these apparatuses are powerful. In the case of television, this invention brought an important innovation: the power to choose (despite this power being limited by the few options of channels). Because of that, people didn't need to enjoy, or not enjoy, just one channel, but they could make choices about what they wanted to watch. Because of that television has different powers. It can educate with amazing channels that make the viewer think about several questions, but it can also harm people when channels or advertisements manage to manipulate who is watching. Therefore, who decides what the purpose of television will be is the viewer. And this decision is very important.

It is not a modern way to learn about animals in zoos. Many people experienced going to zoos in their childhood. In my memory, almost all of the animals in zoos were just sitting and lying in their cage with an uneasy face. Nowadays, many TV programs focus on animals in nature, and animals move lively in the program. There is quite a difference between animals in zoos and those in nature. I thought that keeping animals in zoos should be stopped and let them belong in nature, after watching such TV programs. The origin of zoos is that of rare animal collections for the aristocracy. They treated animals as unique objects, not creatures. In present times, people treat animals in zoos as things that tell us the motion of animals in picture books. Being in a cage and being exposed to human observation stresses animals a lot. It is reported that a giant panda in a Hong Kong zoo that was sterile for a long time got pregnant, and the reason for the pregnancy was that the pandas could spend their time without any witnesses as of the zoo's closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This news indicated that human witnesses might be harmful to animals in zoos. Besides, there are many other ways to learn about animals without zoos in modern society. We can learn about animals from books and TV programs and photos of nature magazines. These ways do not harm animals belonging in nature. It is not suitable to hold animals in the cages of zoos. It stresses them and distorts their lives. Animals are not toys for humans. We should treat them as they are in nature.

Sometimes telling truth is the is the collar of the surviving conflict, worthless, conflicting, worthless, aurelaible because the vast majority of people hate liars. Lying to people means losing confidence. Nobody accepts that, moreover most of them ignore liars. The reason is the consequences that come after believing them or even the problems from their speech. We always see liars spreading rumors and trying to make problems with others. Deception and lying are common human behaviors. There is a lot of research that proves that. Psychologists have utilized research on body language and deception to help members of law enforcement distinguish between the truth and lies, and the results proving the signs of liars are: 1- being vague: If the speaker seems to intentionally leave out important details, it might be because they are lying 2- vocal uncertainly: If the person seems unsure or insecure, they are more likely to perceived as lying 3- indifference: shrugging, lack of expression and a bored posture can be signs of lying 4- overthinking: if the person seems to be thinking too hard to fill in the details of the story, it might because they are deceiving you. The conclusion here is while body language may be helpful, it is important to pay attention to the right signs.

My favourite season of the year My favourite season of the year is spring because there are a lot of colours, flowers, and more, Once when it was spring, there were lots of different animals in one place near my house, it was very beautiful. This season is special for me because in winter most of the things are white because of the snow, but in spring all is colourful and it's very special for me because I feel very happy with lots of colours around me, too. But sometimes there are lots of flowers and obviously lots of bees, and the bees sometimes are very uncomfortable. I would like to have a place with lots of flowers, but without bees, or with bees, but in another place. Because one of the benefits of bees are that they help to reproduce the flowers, and they produce honey too, and that is really delicious.

Dear Mr. Aizen, Thanks for recommending me to use the Write and Improve program. I have used it for a week and today, just like you wanted, I'm going to tell you my experience with it. It's just my opinion, so there are probably a few things you won't agree about with me. First of all, its interface. Well, the interface is eye-catching. It has many options. Secondly, you can connect by using your Facebook account. Hence, you can share your study process to your news feed. And last, the lessons of Write and Improved are divided into levels. That means you can select a level which is right for you. This is what I like most about this program as well. But, nothing is perfect. Although it's good, there is a problem which makes me not like it so much. It's about its error-checking system. Most of the time, it works fine. But, sometimes it's quite confusing. A few days ago, I did a lesson on this program. I quoted a sentence of a celebrity verbatim. Then, it said that it wasn't correct but didn't say what the error was. I tried to check again many times but to no avail. That's what I don't like about this program. In general, this program is still a good choice for people who want to learn English. Our class should try this. Phuc

People have been arguing about those two things for a long time. Actually, each has its particular benefits. Having the same teacher for several years has advantages that the other doesn't have and vice versa. It's hard to say which one is better, but if I had to choose, I would say having new teachers each year is better for students. Why did I say that? Multiple teachers help us see things from different perspectives. They can explain concepts with different ways of understanding and take on topics we feel unqualified to explain. None of these benefits detract from our role as parents and educators, but these partnerships provide opportunities to offer our children more than ever. Have you ever read a book named "Benefits and drawbacks of using multiple instructors to teach single courses" written by Jones, F. & Harris, S? There is a sentence like this: "Multiple instructors working together can be especially effective at meeting high level learning goals." Well, I completely agree with that.

My last holiday was very important to me, because it was the first after the Covid-19 pandemic started. I and my family were at home for three long months, so last July we could stay at a cottage for four days. My children were very happy, my wife was very enthusiastic, and I was happy because of them. That house was very special because of the long period before where we needed to stay at home the whole time and my children did not have another child to play or to join and to be happy together with. So that house in the countryside was perfect. It had a swimming pool, a large space, grass, and a field to run, everything my children wanted. Everybody would have liked to stay there longer, unfortunately it was impossible. We will think about a new opportunity to return there, my children are waiting for a new holiday, and so am I.

There is no doubt that these days studying music is becoming very popular in schools. However, the question is: is studying music good for students ? It is considered one of the most controversial phenomenons today. In this essay, I am going to examine this from both view points. On the one hand, from the argument there are people who argue that studying music in school has considerable benefits that outweigh the disadvantages for many reasons. Th first reason is teaching the students new skills and they can spend a fun time playing the instrument. The second reason is almost all parents want their children to learn music because they know learning music maybe will be a good chance for their children in the future to earn extra money. On the other hand, people claim that studying music is not very important . They believe that it is a waste of time and effort and they also think it is extra and their children can learn it any time . These people believe there other more useful subjects for their children to learn in school more than music is. As we have seen, there is no one easy answer to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that studying music is very interesting if the students want that, so I think studying music is good to be an elective class for students who are interested in learning it.

The experience of studying abroad at young ages is an advantage. Nowadays, studying abroad is not an uncommon experience for ordinary people. Some parents are eager to let their children go to another country to study the language and culture of that country. On the other hand, it is said that studying abroad with no purpose is meaningless. In my opinion, it is a useful experience for young people to go to another country and learn about its culture. It allows them the opportunity to see the world from another perspective. People who go to live in another country should learn about its language and culture, which usually is not familiar to them. It might be hard to understand all of it. However, they can achieve another perspective by touching new thoughts and culture, and that is a strong advantage in life. If they do not become familiar with another culture, the experience of studying abroad might be their worst memory. It is not easy to have friends and a reliable person casually in a foreign country. The sense of failure and unfruitful memory frustrated frustrates them after returning home. Anyway, studying abroad can be a positive challenge for young people. If you can get such an experience at a young age, you have the advantage already. The best teacher in life is one's own experience.

The way of travelling in the future will be very different. Maybe we're going to start having holidays in space, and that's not science fiction, there's a project called 'holidays in space'. Recently a rocket went into space, it was amazing, even if you were watching it on TV. There will be more ways to travel that help the environment , like cars that can travel with solar light as fuel. Going to other countries will be easy and cheaper than now. Flying from the United Kingdom to the United States will cost the same as going by underground. But travelling will be the same as today in some aspects, for example, we're not going to travel by thae way of thinking, for example. If you want to go to China, with only thinking about China you aren't going to be in China for at least another 90 years. You're still going to pay for travelling too. Because even in the future there were lots of things to pay for a travel.

Sure, exercise is very important for my health, however, it is only part of my total health. I believe that, for instance, to be not nervous often is more important, to have peace, so you are not stressed frequently. Another very important and sometimes difficult thing is to eat very well, fruits, vegetables, meats, milk, all the vitamins, minerals, and drink a lot of water. You need to think about doing exercise, but many people that do it drink alcohol at the same time, and worse, have the habit of smoking. One thing that many people forget is to sleep well too, it is necessary to be healthy in mind and body. It is important to not take medicine when you do not need it. And the last, but no less important thing is to sunbathe to have good bones. So, to be healthy, it is not necessary only to do exercise, you need much more...

In my opinion, learning a foreign language is more important today than it was in the past. Today, people have money, they travel to another country for jobs, vacation.... Local people from certain countries want to have customers of different nationalities. The customers being from another country means that they are rich. They can invest a lot of money in a project. If you try to learn a new language, you can easily communicate with foreign customers. You can understand more of what they say and you don't need to spend money to hire an interpreter. An interpreter can be a spy from an enemy company and they can translate something into a different idea. In the past, customers or travelers were few. They didn't have enough money to travel to a different country, so it was less important to learn a foreign language.

Television was created for the purpose of entertaining people, but considering their unfortunate situation, some countries are using television to educate children that don't have enough money to buy a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Everyone knows that in the last century, TVs have had some incredible changes, converting a machine that can project images and audio to one that can search on the internet. Incredible, right. But can television educate as well? No, it can't. Television can teach sometimes, but if a student doesn't understand a topic, the TV is not going to resolve his or her questions, and the children can't be watching television for one hour a day, especially young children, because their learning needs to be more interactive than a recorded class on TV. In conclusion, TV can educate, but it is not as good as being in touch with a teacher to answer all of the children's questions.

In my opinion, I think that school should replace books with computers and tablets. Books are hard to find in a library. They are very thick and they are easily destroyed by tearing them and pouring water onto them. Students can't read a book in the dark without light, but they can read computers and tablets. Computers and tablets can light up their screen by the light inside it. Tablets and computers can also find books for you online. For example, the book that you want to read is not in your school library, so you can't read it. But tablets and computers can search for the book for you. They can search every book online for you and you don't need to worry about having no books to read. Tablets can also translate new words for you online so you can concentrate on reading books.

There is a wide diversity of subjects we have at school. Some of them we like and other ones we hate. But do we really need all these subjects at school? A good example of subject whose importance is often discussed is music classes. On the one hand, only two or three pupils from each class do something related to music in their later life, but everyone has to endure music classes during the school time. For some children who have no talent for it, it is very difficult not to fail in this subject. It is also not fair when some students are doing music in their free time and another only has one lesson a week at school. In such a situation some students have advantages and better grades only because their parents sent them to music school or because their parents can play some instruments themselves and can teach their children too. On the other hand, some parents even come to the idea of sending their child to play piano, so this student will never find out whether he likes it or not. And by having music classes at school some students can discover new subjects and maybe even find a new hobby. And it is the function of school: to bring children to new spheres which can interest them. To sum up, I think that schools have to offer music classes, but do not need to make them compulsory till the end of school, but for example only till fifth grade.

These days the majority of university students prefer to live with their families when they study, and other students prefer to live with their families when they study., and other students appel to move to live alone or with their friends. I completely agree with students who prefer to move and live on their own while they are students. First of all, it is often argued that moving to live away from family is more advantageous for students who want to complete their studies for two main reasons . The first reason is these students will be more dependent on themselves more than they were. The second reason is many studies and research shows that students who live alone or on their own are more confident in themselves than students who live with their families. For instance, university students who live away will try new experiences and learn new things which they will explore by themselves. That is why moving to live away from family is very important especially during studying at university which helps them to be independent and confident in life. Secondly, living alone or away from families assists in many aspect for students to be successful in their life. For that reason, the majority of parents encourage their children to pursue their goals even if their goals were in another area because they already know this way is very advantageous for their children in their future life. The good illustration here is the new studies which prove that students who move to live away from their families can afford the responsibilities in the future especially in their jobs and they are more successful in their life. Thus, to live a successful life depends on your own choices. To conclude, I strongly believe that living an independent life is more useful to advance in life. It is useful for people's characteristics to be successful in the future .

Video games are good or bad for children? People have asked this question for such a long time. Some people believe that they are good, others believe the opposite. In my opinion, they have both positive and negative effects. Positive effects? According to Ted Talk, video games have many positive effects. First: problem solving and logic. When a child plays games like Flappy Bird, he trains his brain to come up with creative ways to solve puzzles and other problems in short bursts. Next: accuracy. Action games train the player's brain to make fast decisions without losing accuracy. As you can see, video games give children positive effects. However, too much of anything is just too much. Video games could negatively impact your studies. This is the clearest effect that everyone knows. When you spend a lot of time playing videos games, you start to feel tired and you don't want to do your exercises anymore. Next, it may cause insomnia. An adequate amount of sleep is essential for your brain and body to be productive during the day. However, excessive gaming, especially before sleep, can result in insomnia and sleep deprivation. That's it. Everything has two sides. If you do it properly, it will give you positive effects. If not, you'll have some problems. So be careful!

One of the most popular games in the world are video games. Most children have experienced playing video games. the negative impacts, I think playing video games is an exciting thing to do in our world. We can let our children experience it and keep an eye on their behavior, too. One of the most positive effects on children would be that it improves their brain function. Video games develop their skills and their ways of thinking. In addition, living in a small flat could be boring for children. Video games give them the chance to play and be with their parents. Also, some video games have been designed to nurture children and their potentials. Parents could control their kids and also, help them to use these games to learn something new. In conclusion, I think it is good for children to use video games. We can pay attention to their disadvantages and use them in the best way.

Most medical doctors work in this field because they like to achieve good prestige and earn high salaries. The rural regions are always suffering from lack of health care and professionals. There are some specific reasons for this problem. First of all, there is not enough money in the rural regions since most rural areas are located in the periphery and most of the people there live in poverty. So, they cannot afford the costs of the medical system. In addition, the government does not support these regions. Most rural areas have been forgotten in the policies and public plans. As a result, the government does not know about the situation. In my opinion, the government must pay more attention to the rural areas and prepare plans to improve their situation, especially in the health system. Also, it must make a compulsory rule for medical doctors to work in the peripheral regions for a couple of years. Moreover, it should support them to earn enough money to maintain their motivation. In conclusion, although working in the rural areas is more difficult for medical doctors, there are some solutions to make them satisfied and develop the rural life condition.

In some countries, schools have a music course for all students. But, other countries may disagree with music or they are not able to provide musical instruments. In my opinion, we need to consider music as a practical course for students. But, it would be better to give students a chance to choose it by themselves. The first reason is, music can improve their mental and physical situation. For instance, music makes people feel peace and happiness. The whole history of the world is full of different kinds of music and musical instruments which have brought beauty for individuals. Another reason for using a music course is to develop students' talents and potentials. In other words, they could be able to find their skills in music and would follow it in the future as a career. In conclusion, it would be better to have a music course in our schools, but it should be an optional choice. Personally, I would always love to have a chance to try a specific musical instrument.

Going to university could change people's lifestyle. Most students would decide to move and start a new life in a different way. On the other hand, some prefer to stay with their family as the same. In my opinion, moving away and living on your own has some advantages. The first main reason is, by living alone you can achieve independence. It means, you can make a decision on your own and control your life without any interference. The other one is living away would prepare you for the future. You can start learning how to earn money and manage your costs. Also, you have a chance to face tough situations and find the solutions. On the other hand, some people believe students must stay with their family because of the lack of the security in society. But, in my view, students must learn early how protect themselves. In conclusion, students could see the life at university as an opportunity to learn how to live on their own. It helps them to live better in the future.

Sleep is essential for our good health. Recently, exercise has experienced a boom among all ages. The importance of exercise is recognized commonly. However, there is a thing that is more important than exercise but not treated seriously. Sleep is more important than exercise, but most people ignore their lack of sleep. Lack of sleep can have various negative effects on our health. There are a lot of studies which show the bad influence of insufficient sleep. For example, a report published by the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry said that a lack of sleep could make our minds sensitive to negative stress. Sleep is closely related to appetite. One research study found that insufficient sleep increases appetite and reduces the feeling of fullness. This study indicates that a lack of sleep might affect our weight. Many studies show that insufficient sleep has a negative impact on our health. However, people treat the risk of it as a trivial matter. Exercise is a good thing, but sleep is essential for our health.

These days, students need to do some volunteer work before they graduate . This system is required in almost all high schools. I completely agree with this requirement to work as a volunteer . First of all, volunteering work teaches students enormous things and information which they have not tried or known about before. When students volunteer to work in charity places to help poor people or old people, all these works will change students' thinking and beliefs for the better by making them be more cooperative because they spend their time and effort without any wage. Doctors, for example, are among the most people who provide volunteering. Not just their work as a doctor requires that from them, but they know the poor, the old and the ill people need a doctor's assistance. To illustrate, poor people do not have enough money to pay for the hospital, and most old people cannot go to the hospital. So that is why volunteering work is important for students before they graduate, which makes them help other people. Secondly, in every major the volunteering work has advantages for both the students and the companies or the volunteering place. There are many institutes , companies, universities and shelters that need a lot of employees but they cannot pay them a high wage or their budgets cannot afford to pay for new employees. So the best solution here is volunteering work . That assists these places to provide the best services for people . A good illustration here is shelters which need volunteer people to help the shelter's center to provide enough services for poor people who come from other countries due to war or other reasons . Thus , volunteering is a good choice to complete the lack of needs. In conclusion, I strongly believe that volunteering work is very important for all students to learn and try new experiences.

Zoos are good or cruel for animals? A sensitive question, right? When you ask someone, he may say they're good. But then, you ask another person the same question and he gives the opposite answer. So who is right? In my opinion, I prefer the latter, which means they're not good for animals. First, animals should be free, not jailed. Imagine that you're an animal. You're living in the wilderness and one day, you're captured and put into a cage. You can't do anything. You're separated from your own kind, you spend the whole day going around inside the cage. How would you feel about that? Secondly, it's about the zoos. Well, some zoos take care of the animals in a bad way. They don't feed them, even mistreat them. That's the second reason why I don't like zoos. And you say that they're good places to learn about animals? If it were years ago, it may be true. But now, look around us. Smartphones and social media are everywhere. We can search for anything on the Internet. It describes it in even more detail. So why do we need zoos? For something else? Whatever the reasons, they won't change my mind.

It was a really memorable moment for me when I arrived there. At first, I met one of my best friends at the airport. After seeing him, we went to a hotel and checked in. Then we started visiting the city. We visited a lot of monuments in Istanbul which were really amazing. We also went to visit a famous mosque and I believe it was a beautiful ancient building. In addition, Istanbul is a gorgeous city and you can experience fascinating moments. I can remember when we were walking in the streets, we were delighted.

One aspect of having a good job is its place. I think people need to feel convenient at work. In my opinion, it absolutely depends on the type of job. I will explain my reasons to provide a good answer. First of all, in the enormous companies it is better to enclose the place because people who work in a huge building must deal with a lot of people. In addition, separate walls could increase discipline and specify their duties. On the other hand, with an open design they would lose their privacy. Also, in these kinds of companies providing security is more difficult than in small offices. On the other hand, an open design is appropriate for small offices. By removing walls people can feel sincere with each other. In an open place, colleagues and their employees can work as a team and it helps them to increase their skills together. But, it can put their privacy in danger. In conclusion, each type of design has cons and pros. But, it is important to know which one is better for them. We can use both kinds in a specific situation.

In my opinion, learning a new language is more important now than before. I will give some reasons for answering like this. First of all, the relationships between people are increasing these days. There are some ways of communicating, such as on social media, travelling in much fewer hours, economical relations, educations and (etc.). To have a good relationship with foreign people we must learn their language. The second reason is immigration purposes. Most people like to go abroad and live in a foreign country. The first thing that they must learn is the language of the host country. As a result, learning a new language is really important today.

Studying abroad? Should or shouldn't I? Some people say "should," the others say "shouldn't." So, which is right? Everything has 2 sides, so it's hard to answer which is correct. Let's take a look at this. First, I'll talk about its advantages. Studying abroad gives you many benefits. You can see the world, study with a better education, and experience a new culture. Your language skills will be extremely improved. You will have opportunities to get a great job as well. There are still more advantages of studying abroad, but I think this is enough. Now, this is about its disadvantages. Homesickness. Being away from your family and friends can be a lonely experience. This can result in sadness and anxiety. I have seen a number of students studying abroad having to come back because they can't stand the loneliness. Cost. An important thing that you have to worry about is the cost. The cost of studying abroad can be high, especially when you don't have a scholarship. Next is culture shock. This rarely happens, but who knows? You will be faced with a new language, customs, food, dress styles, etc. . This may make you frustrated even if you have it fully researched.

My topic is the difference between a city and a rural area. I would like to focus on medical doctors. In the cities there are many doctors, more than in the rural areas. Why? Is it a problem? I would like to begin with the second question. In my opinion it may be a problem because of the economic situation. The doctors want to be in the cities because they can be in the middle of cultural and social life. In the cities there are more possibilities for education. On the other hand the neighborhood is anonymous. The health problems are respiratory for example influenza, coronavirus. Other problems are connected to the immune system. The other situation is in the rural areas. We can see advantages and disadvantages too. The doctor can be a part of a patient's family. He knows his anamnesis and family's genes. The health problems are connected to surgery on legs or arms.

Living a healthy life is not easy. A lot of people think that to live longer only two things are necessary: doing exercise and eating healthy foods. However, for a greater understanding, there are several habits that may be considered to live better. For instance, taking care of our mental health. It's normal for people to say that the body is linked to the mind. But just in a few cases, people give real importance to caring for the mind. To have a healthy mind it is essential to be conscious of how our body is. If a person goes to the gym every day, but lives in a routine full of sadness, he is not completely healthy. Besides that, it is important to understand what things make everyone happy. If a person is happy travelling, he should invest more time and energy in planning a future trip. Or if a person misses his family a lot, he should stay closer to his relatives. So, there are a lot of factors that must be considered to live better. But the most important thing is that each person is different and only that person can know what makes him happy.

Hello Rie, Yes, I agree to go to eat at your house. Don't worry about what I eat. A few weeks ago, I used to eat a lot of junk food, meat, fatty food and so on, but, now I'm eating salad, I'm into eating pudim, meat, broccoli, vegetables and so on. I'm going on a diet and I don't want to put on weight. I hope you make a fruit juice. I used to drink soda, but I stopped drinking soda or artificial juice.

"My favourite season of the year" Everybody loves one of the 4 seasons of the year. Most commonly it's the season when we have a birthday or when there was or there is going to be an important event for us, like a wedding, vacation, Christmas, or Easter. But I have other reasons. My favourite season is spring. I think it is unique. In winter we stay at home, cover up with blankets and drink tea or cocoa. Outside it is peaceful and quiet. Nowadays, in Poland, snow doesn't fall. The winter in Poland is cold and wet. It is really depressing. But in spring everything changes. The grass starts to be green (not brown or yellow like in winter). On trees we can see buds. Beautiful, little buds. I like it when my neighbour's forsythia is blooming. I feel happy when I look at it. In cities, people go out, meet with friends, and organise parties and events. People become happier and start smiling. Everybody makes plans for summer. It's a really optimistic season. I wonder how many people love spring?

Video games can be a good thing for children. Some games help them with skills that maybe they didn't know that they had, like working in a group and wait for friend, but unfortunately most of these games are very violent for the little kids that don't have any idea what's going on there. By the way, I think some parents should know what type of games their children are playing. So if they do this the games are gonna be cooler and more fun. So I think these games are good, but without permission it isn't good. Maybe when a kid has access to the internet they search for games that are inappropriate for their age and this makes little kids see something that they don't have to see. For this reason, the presence of an adult is very important to avoid that they visit a page that is inappropriate for their age. This is an important alert for the parents.

Studying abroad is a dream of most students that are in high school or at university. The big reason, in my opinion, is to learn about a new culture and another language, but discovering a new country has a big importance, too. So if I am given a chance to live abroad, honestly I will go without thinking about it because it is my big dream, and I really hope that one day I can realize it. But while this is not happening I can study here without a problem. By the way, I think the biggest disadvantage is living without the people that you love, like your family. This is very bad, but with the Internet nowadays it is easier to talk with them when I miss them. Already there are so many advantages that we can talk about. The first is discovering another country. Obviously, there are so many others that I don't know how to write about them, but talking with new people and making new friends, and travelling around the world while you are there are some examples.

I believe that television can educate. In fact, television today has some channels, series, and films which educate a lot. Today, you can see so many different channels that could entertain you, like with comedy films or series. Although these types of films are underestimated they also give us a lot of life lessons. For example, letting children watch cartoons can teach them how to love, to be friends, or even find something they don't know. Every type of TV program educates on a specific topic. Documentaries teach you what to do in case of an attack by a predator, or survive in a storm, tsunami, and other types of bad weather. There are TV series which tell you how to do something, like cooking special foods or how to organise a beautiful birthday party. In addition to all these types of programs there are some whose first goal is to make people laugh; letting them forget the outside world. In conclusion, I agree with the fact that TV can educate us.

Dear Teacher, The new school year has arrived. The last one passed quite well for me, but it was not enough. There are several objectives that I haven't fulfilled yet. So, in this year, I'll try my best to do them well. But first, let me answer the question about the areas of my learning I'm pleased with. They are mathematics, communication, and language. They are the areas that I have enjoyed since I was a kid. Well, I also want to improve my communication and language, especially English. I'm still not good at speaking and listening. This is the first thing that made me unsatisfied with myself in the last school year. The second thing is my literacy. I have to admit that it is still bad. So I have to improve it. And what will I do to achieve my goals? Try my best. It's the best I can do.

I started to use Write and Improve a few months ago. I found this website because I was studying English on another website and that website recommended I should try this if I wanted to improve my skills, and I tried it. So I used W&I as a complement for my grammar classes and put in practise all I learned in past classes. And after I did this, then I figured out that it isn't easy to make sentences with your own knowledge. And for me that's how you improve because you start to try it and if you don't know you start to search for information and start over once more. The first time I couldn't understand how to use it, but actually it's very easy and the tools that this website has are very useful, you get feedback once you finish a lesson.

For me, the best holiday is the trip to Hueco Mundo last summer. I went with my family and some of my friends. We chose this destination because we heard that it was one of the top must-go countries in the world. It was also where my brother had been studying so we wanted to visit him as well. The rumors were indeed not wrong. It was gorgeous, more than you could imagine. The beauty of Hueco Mundo was unbelievable: the buildings with glittering lights, the incredibly clean streets and so on. The food was really good too. It was simple with rice, vegetables, some meat, just like we had in our country, but it tasted delicious. We stayed at a hotel in the capital. The next day, we visited our brother about 5 kilometers away. He took us to many places: museums, galleries, etc. We learnt about many things: culture, customs, clothes,... We stayed there for two more days and the last day, we got on the plane and went home. It was the best holiday for me. I not only had a lot of fun but also learned many useful things.

Being healthy is important as you get older. Some people work hard all their life to earn money, then they ignore they selfl care both physical and mental health. Therefore, this could lead to spending their earnings to cure a sickness, instead of preparing for their retirement. In my opinion, taking care of your health and your wealth are crucial for living. Why is wealth necessary? As we live in a capitalist society money could provide a high standard of living, therefore getting rich is the ultimate goal for most people. Wealth is a major supporter of optimum health because it gives you the financial freedom to make healthy choices and avail of any existing health and fitness resources. Unfortunately, in our market place today, the healthier food choices are more expensive than the damaging processed varieties. This is why wealth is also the freedom of our financial security. In contrast, better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people.

I think the two ways have benefits because if you've the same teacher for a few years, he'll be able to help you in specific ways. Like in what topics you need more help and which ones you don't, and the way that he should teach so everyone can understand him. Although this can cause some kind of boredom since every class can turn into a repetition of the other classes. However, if you have a different teacher every year, it allows you to learn different techniques and tricks to learn new things from the new teacher since that new teacher has some new methods to teach. Even so, this can turn bad because that new teacher doesn't know how the students are and he won't know how to find the best way to help them and improve the knowledge of every single student. Finally, I'd prefer a new teacher every year, I think that's the best way to improve for me.

We often watch TV news about an elderly woman living close to 120 years, with reporters asking her the secret of healthy living. We cannot deny that recent developments in medical fields have dramatically raised the average life span. However, I do not value highly those news reports, as shorter but intense lives could be more meaningful. Firstly, not so many 80 or 90 years old people can afford to live on their own, forcing their sons or daughters to support their daily lives. Although living together makes family bonds stronger, it must be a burden for younger generations to support their parents while working or raising their children. Some even spend their last ten years of life hospitalized, which accompanies tremendous medical costs. In no way should lives without health be happy. Secondly, having shorter lives may be a motivation for younger generations to appreciate their lives well. Despite having adequate free time, some businessmen waste their time and just stay home on weekends idly. As most people spend their twenties through sixties working at the same company, such activities as doing hobbies or travelling on weekends are indispensable to avoid mundane lives. A shorter time after retirement encourages younger generations to seek what leads them to spend their time happily. For these two reasons, I believe not having an excessively long life span should be a shortcut to having a meaningful life.

Have you ever wondered, "What will our way of travelling look like in the future?" Will we still travel the same way as we do now? My prediction is it may be different. We may travel faster, more safely, and with less impact on the environment. At present, you can see that there are so many problems with travel: emissions, traffic jams, traffic accidents,... Therefore, many scientists and engineers have started to think about how to change our way of travelling. They are working, testing to create new vehicles to minimize the problems I mentioned before. Several ideas and projects have been introduced. In 2017, Elon Musk showed his project of Hyperloop, a proposed model of passenger and freight transportation. He also conducted a test and it worked. I know, there will be many concerns surrounding this project but it's still a positive signal for our future travel. I guess you have heard about flying cars. Many prototypes have been built since the early 20th century. Most recently, a flying car named Cezeri was first introduced and it worked fine. There are still many other projects and ideas to change our future way of travelling. I hope they will become true.

Medicine is an arduous work to do because doctors not only have to spend many hours on duty but also they have to study hard to become a good professional. That is the reason why a lot of doctors want to work in a good hospital in cities instead of rural areas; this problem means that there are not enough doctors there. Besides, the lack of doctors in rural areas is because those doctors who have to go there have to leave their family or friends and their life cost is difficult because there are no facilities that a city provides. Also, an important reason for doctors is the delay and lack of adequate equipment to work correctly and develop their job in a good way. The presented reasons are the reason why doctors don't want to do their practice or work in those kinds of areas. Some quick fixes for this problematic situation that affects everyone could be providing the rural doctors with a better payment to be there. But, if hospitals and rural areas can't afford a high salary, the rural community and the place where doctors go should make it as comfortable as they can. Rural communities could try to adapt acceptable places for doctors, not only for their stancy but also to work correctly with adequate devices, having as a result more doctors will apply to work in those kinds of places.

With the current pace of people's lifestyle in this generation, an activity that links to our life at rest is continuously rising from the existence of technology and all the services with attempts to obtain profit from our laziness. As a result thereof, do we need to encourage a more active lifestyle by enforcing mandatory sport classes in the school curriculum? I fully disagree with this question, and two reasons are accounted for regarding this. Firstly, every student possesses their time schedule which is varied and different for each person. Including three classes of sport each week can possibly consume an excessive amount of time that one can utilise in a way that is beneficial for their lives. Some students, for example, may need to be a part-timer in order to gain enough money for their tuition; or giving every vacant timeslot possible to their loved ones can be a case for some, like one of my friends, whose mother has Alzheimer's disease, tries to reduce the cost of hiring a nurse for her mother. Secondly, although one decides not to do any sport, this does not guarantee that one has an inactive life since several activities can do this duty in lieu. Gardening, housework, or grocery shopping are considered activities that demonstrate the usage of a large amount of energy and increased human stamina. Instead of compelling students to do sport, which can possibly lead to hatred of sport, if educational institutions recommend an activity that can potentially be incorporated into students' daily life for an improved active lifestyle such as using stairs instead of the elevator, this may be a more appropriate choice for many. To summarise, why mandatory sport classes, personally, expresses disagreement: the existence of a personal timetable and a plethora of sports - substituted activities in order to achieve an active lifestyle.

Learning a foreign language is hard work. Even if in this generation, a lot of artificial intelligence has been created to translate languages from around the world, personal communication skills in a foreign language are still important in our life. There are two outstanding reasons to support this idea. First, being a multi-linguist is more advantageous. Students who can speak a foreign language fluently tend to achieve more at school and college. Most people feel more comfortable communicating with us people than with computers or robots, so we would choose to communicate with someone who understands us first. Speaking in the same language, we can work faster. Second, there are still people who cannot use any other than their primary language. Being able to communicate in a second language, we would be able to contact them properly. A language translator or dictionary consumes time. Therefore, these are reasons why I think learning to speaking a foreign language is as important these days as it was in the past.

Musical activities are important to develop imagination and creative skills. Music is an essential part of everyone's life because, from the cradle, human beings hear sounds, music or melodies like lullabies or different kinds of sounds. That is the reason why from kindergarten people begin to learn or to play an instrument, being the reason why schools add music in their scholars framework. Nowadays, a lot of schools have music classes every week in their schedules in order to give cultural knowledge, distraction and to develop abilities in students. Besides, students have the opportunity to discover if music is a hidden talent to develop and start to practise and improve their musical abilities. I personally consider that music is an essential part of people's life so all students should study music at least once in their life because this activity allows them to find a way for distraction or to find their passion. To summarize, people who have had music classes in their academic life are able to manage stress better. They also have had the opportunity to discover something new and to take a break from stressful routines or simply their daily lifestyle.

In my opinion, Write and Improve is a useful tool for any person that is learning English. It is a terrific way to improve English writing. What I most like about Write and Improve is the feedback. In a few minutes, it is possible to know what aspects are necessary to improve and the main mistakes that were made, including grammar and vocabulary. On the other hand, it is very hard to know what the mistake is when there appears only a sentence in a different color and there are no suggestions to make the sentence better. I would love it if the program could show me some options to improve my sentences. To sum up, I definitely recommend this tool for my classmates. It is an easy and interesting way to improve English writing any time you want without worrying about judgment.

The first thing I liked most about Write and Improve is its variable topics. There are many topics that you can choose to practise to write in English.

That means you can practise writing English at any time and anywhere. The third thing is the progress report after finishing each task, which helps me to know how my writing is improving or not. On the other hand, I disliked how the Write and Improve course corrected my writing. Write and Improve should give me suggestion sentences in addition to comments. In general, Write and Improve is an interesting website to practise and improve your English and I am very sure about recommending my classmates to try it.

I disbelieve the claim that doctors want to work in cities for money. Yes , it is a fact that in cities doctor get more wages than in any rural areas. But it is not for the money but for the facilities that are not there in rural areas. Doctor have a most hectic schedule and they don't get enough time for rest and supposing a doctor gets to work in rural areas where there is no infrastructure and facilities, how can a doctor make his mind focus on his work alone? There is a lot to change in rural areas and the first thing to do is to work on infrastructures so that there can be scope to make new hospitals. People in rural areas are not knowledgeable enough to recognize the importance of medical science. There are a lot of incidents that have happened recently that support the fact that doctors in villages are not safe. Though people believe doctors are god, when the purpose is not fulfilled, they do not hesitate to show their anger to doctors in the form of physical violence. Also people in villages do not prefer to go to hospital, they prefer either local remedies or they involve themselves in dark magic.

Well, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. First, starting with the open design in which there is no partition and everything is spacious, while in enclosed workstations there is a small partition which is present for privacy. I personally like spacious places where I do not feel suffocated and can think freely watching the different things which help in getting ideas. Also it is not an easy task to just sit in one place bounded by a small space. Now, as time advances, we are moving towards working together and for that reason an open design is a must. Many big companies like Google, Facebook, etc. prefer to use a spacious environment where everyone can interact with each other and can get helpful ideas from everybody. Now, an open environment is necessary for all the offices, not because it helps in work life but it also affects their mental health. To maximize the output from employees, many companies are now considering and focusing on mental health and physical health because if employees are not fit from inside there is no chance that they can give the company their full potential service. The environment affects your mental and physical health. Where you sit, where you eat, where you work. Everything matters.

Hello Matt, I was thinking about how I can improve my English, so I thought of using texts, videos and getting some speaking classes. I start my new English classes next Monday. To improve my English I will read more in English, and I will use texts with different levels of English difficulty. I will try to watch videos in the English language and without subtitles as well.

Every morning in my free time I do BeatSaver. BeatSaver is a VR sound game, where the player cuts a flying box with the light savers. Each box has an arrow. Players must cut the box in the direction of each arrow. Boxes are identically flying in musical rhythm. This is sometimes a challenging exercise but so much fun.

Some students like to have the same teacher for several years because in this way they can have a kind of affection, and it is very easy to cope with a person that you know very well. Some learners feel more comfortable when their teacher becomes a close person. On the other hand, having a lot of teachers can be better, because it is a way to learn different things from different people in very different manners. Every person has an individual way to explain, and when something is very hard for us to understand, maybe it will be easy when another person explains the same. To sum up, it doesn't matter if you like learning from only one person or from different ones. What is really important is that you are able to choose someone that can explain well and you can understand and enjoy the learning moment and you do not only memorize things.

That is a hard reality, but always fewer medical doctors decide to work in the rural areas where a high rate of diseases and illnesses are expected over the next decades. This is an attitude related to different social and economic issues, most of them affecting our modern society. The most impressive is the lack of good will and the bad attitude towards helping others. Rural areas are becoming more and more crowded after many people make a comeback in the countryside, where some new diseases are unfortunately spreading. New jobs are spreading in different areas but this does not seem to interest young medical doctors. It is not difficult to guess the reasons, first of all we are speaking about areas involved in famine, wars, droughts and every kind of risky situation that does not help to persuade doctors. Another important point is that rural areas are cut off from the most important places in a city and they often are not provided with the most essential services. Last but not least, it takes a long time to get to a city. Some solutions are going to be thought of to improve the situation, like a better means of transport system or the building of new facilities that simplify doctors' lives in rural areas. Some new services at doctors' disposal are not the only solution. The economic crises make people poorer, it means they do not have enough money to afford detailed and suitable cures. As I see it, governments should make sensitive - based decisions, like funding hospitals in rural areas and giving a rise in payment to the doctors.

I think that computers and tablets shouldn't replace books, because when you look at a computer or a tablet too much time it can hurt your eyes. Books don't hurt your eyes and are made of paper, and books improve your reading skills. Sometimes tablets can distract kids who should be paying attention to a class instead, but books don't cause distraction. Books are made for kids to be interested in learning about different subjects, but if tablets replace books, the tablets can sometime have a bad connection, the tablets can run out of battery, or the tablets can sometimes be very bad and they can break. If books were replaced by tablets and computers, the school would have to pay for the computers and tablets and for a good internet connection, which can be very expensive sometimes. That is why I think books should stay.

I use my free time to read. I read every day. I like reading because it helps me to improve my reading skills and build up my vocabulary. I've discovered that reading is a good distraction whenever I'm dwelling on negative thoughts. Instead of dwelling on those thoughts, I use that time to read instead. I read a variety of subjects but I enjoy reading about behaviour of people the most. The last time I read was about an hour ago. The article was about how to reduce boredom. The article does support the theory of 'mind over matter'. It's hard to control our mind sometimes. But I'm aware that we can learn to control it before it controls us.

For a start, I would like to say that I am not really good at English. I have been learning English since my fifth grade, but I am not satisfied with my level of English. In this report, I would like to point out some areas I want to improve next. Most importantly, I would like to improve my level of speaking. I understand almost everything. For instance, I watch many shows or movies in English without subtitles. I am pretty much pleased with my comprehension. On the other hand, when it comes to speaking I am not able to remember some words which I want to use. Furthermore, it is difficult for me to speak fluently.

It would definitely help my entire English level. In conclusion, I want to improve my ability to speak and write, and extend my vocabulary.

According to research, every family in the city owns at least one television at home. In fact, TV has already become an essential part of our living room. The following essay is intended to share with you some of my personal opinions on the effects of television on our real life. Firstly, TV includes a great number of television channels. Each channel has its own particular theme: for example, documentaries, fashion, music , dance, and cartoons for children. As you noticed, many of them are created in order to entertain people. However, some television stations are dedicated to global news, which is interesting and contemporary, and important to people to keep up with the events of the world. In this view, TV gives us the possibilities of knowing more information about the world. Secondly, many parents often let their kids watch cartoons on TV. Children enjoy watching them and at the same time they could learn more words and good behaviour. In fact, all cartoons have been studied by child psychologists so as to ensure an educational purpose. In conclusion, watching TV could be a good way to relax as well as to educate.

The School of the Future will probably be very different in my opinion. First of all, holograms will be very common. When a teacher starts a class, an image with a topic will appear and the teacher can interact with the animation. Another difference will be outside the class, the students could interact with the teacher, with the school, and with the subjects all day, with the school and with the disciplines all the day, an explanation by the teacher, and many new things, such as a documentary about a theme. When a student returns to school all their homework has arrived on time. When they do it the task will be in the school at the same time, in a virtual place. Students will have a chip with all the information about them, so if a teacher of the school staff wants to know something about them, it will be automatic.

My favourite season of the year is spring. It is my favourite season because the flowers grow and there a lot of fun things that you can do in spring, like going to play in the park, having sleepovers with friends, and you can also be with your friends. Also, it is my birthday in Spring. There are also other cool events in spring like, Children's Day and Easter. Also some people get spring fever, which is good, and you get to experience the nice wonderful days. There are lots of things to see in spring too, like the beautiful birds flying in the sky, the plants and trees that are growing, and lots of fun. Also, if you like nature you can draw or take photographs of the trees and plants in the park or in your backyard. That is why my favourite season of the year is spring.

Hi Anna, I hope you're well. How was your weekend? My weekend was good. I went to see a movie called Parasite on Saturday and I'm so excited to share my experience with you. It is a thriller movie. Now I can say it is one of my favourite films so far. The movie is about two different types of families. One is a poor family and another one is a rich family. The movie illustrates the different life of two families in a sarcastic way. Common manipulative behaviour such as lying or sneaking are well portrayed in this movie. If you want to watch something different from what you have watched so far, don't forget to add Parasite to your 'must-watch' list.

Have you ever wondered "What will the school of the future look like? Will it either still be the same or different?" From my point of view, along with the development of the world, I think school in the future will change in many ways. First, as you can see, laptops and smartphones are present more. In the future, traditional classes where a teacher sits at the table and shares their knowledge will change. Online classes with modern devices will replace them gradually. Secondly, it's about the knowledge. The present one is quite old, obsolete, not commonly used anymore. Everyone knows that. Therefore, researchers, scientists, and educationalists have started to change it. Finally, school buildings and infrastructure. Technological developments will definitely impact them. There will be a lot of modern devices in school, such as smart whiteboards, reading pads, etc. In a nutshell, school in the future will go along with the development of technology. We can't say if it's good or bad, but it will definitely be interesting.

In my opinion, television entertains, but it can educate too. We have a lot of good programs on television. The grade of the channel of television has many kinds of programs, some are only to have fun, some to inform, and some to educate. I guess, television has not only one purpose, it has various purposes. I believe that it is important to create more programs to give a better education. I can imagine this goal of television being, for instance, for old people that stay at home more time. It can be a great opportunity. We can think about the capacity of television to go inside almost all houses, it is very powerful. Another example of television being helpful is for the education of housewives, many women can use the television to learn a new career, new abilities, and new skills.

People are different, aren't they? Some people like celebrations and some prefer to be quiet. I like both. However, I rarely celebrate my birthday though.

A universal language Why does every school choose English as the second language to teach students? Why do many parents want their kids to speak English perfectly? The answer is English is the universal language. To cut down the differences Today, the world where we are living in is composed of 193 countries. They have different cultures , beliefs, and people. However, language is the most crucial difference between them. That's why it is so important to learn a common way of speaking. So, English is ideal for everyone , because it is the most diffused language in the world. Two strangers could know more about each other if only they spoke a common language. Essential for life As everything else, I started learning English when I was at elementary school. Then, the more I grew up , the more I understood the essentials of English. Travelling is my passion, if I hadn't learned English, I would never be able to go abroad. The majority of my friends are foreigners. Recommendation Learning English seriously is an intelligent choice. Even if you rarely have possibilities to use it, don't give up and keep studying it .

Hello everyone, I love animals, I consider they are wonderful beings, able to give us love, help, happiness, in some situations support, and to end loneliness. I have an amazing cat, she is my pretty baby. We play and sleep together. She is important for me. I think domestic animals are excellent for our lives, but the damage that we have done to them is sad, they depend on us. If they are left to be independent, some animals have a decent life, but others aren't well and suffer. Another point of view is that wild animals are exotic and they are used to earn money. They should be in nature and be free in their habitat. Unfortunately, humans have destroyed their habitat and some are in danger of extinction. For this reason, it's necessary that those species are in zoos. In summary, I think humans are the problem, we have destroyed their habitats, we pay for looking at wild animals, to take over the domestic animals and sometimes to have pets and to hurt them.

For me, that's a great idea because it has a lot of advantages, like learning about culture, meeting new people, and especially the mentality that they teach in schools abroad and improving your language speaking with native people. Another advantage that I consider important is the fact that this adventure helps you to open your mind because maybe a lot of students have a way of understanding and doing things, and that's how their schools taught them, but in the moment they go to a different country they have to change the way that they're accustomed to doing things, and that's the moment when you improve yourself to be better in many things, like school, work, social life, etc. I don't think that there are important disadvantages, maybe some issues with language and getting used to doing new things, but those are problems that can be solved. I'd like to try this once.

Children are spending most of their time on video games nowadays. In my opinion, this situation has a negative impact on them. Although it is a fun activity, more and more kids are showing health problems, such as obesity and sight problems. Another serious problem is about social interaction, children don't go to play outside anymore because they are very busy trying to fight against a great villain and to help their favourite super hero to save the world. On the other hand, parents feel more comfortable when their kids are playing inside because they think it is safer and they can do other things that they want to do without worrying about being interrupted. To sum up, video games can be really fun and very useful to entertain children in a simple and safe way. However, it is necessary to take notice of how much time children are spending on them and to observe that they are only allowing that their lives are getting ahead in front of their through the screen of a computer or of a cell phone.

I decided to go to the concert to feel the energy of a showcase of this legendary group. It's amazing that this music group is still performing nowadays. To my mind, this was a unique occasion to witness this big event. At the beginning and at the end of the concert we had fireworks! They invited someone to join them on stage to sing with them "With or Without You," what a beautiful moment. How was your trip to Norway? I hope that we can meet each other during the next holidays.

Write and Improve is a web page where you can enter some text for a task. For example, for an opinion essay, and it tells you what your mistakes are for you to correct them. It's useful for people that are preparing for international exams to know their level and improve it. I'm using it to improve my English and write better. I suggest it for students that want to know how to improve their writing skills and how to prepare to write a text from 25 to 600 words. But it has some defects, for example, you need to pay for extra tasks that are for official preparing for a B2 First exam or a normal English exam. And you need to at least submit an answer every day, if not you'll lose all your progress. But I would recommend it to improve your writing.

I walked around the place with my classmates. We enjoyed the lovely temperature and a small splash that came from the waterfall every five minutes while walking. I took many pictures and I posted some of them on my Instagram. Feel free to look at them when you have free time.

Honestly, for me, animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. My thought is if you were an animal, would you like to stay locked up in a prison? I wouldn't . Presently, we are living at a delicate moment of our existence because of covid-19. For this reason we are in lockdown, so these past month have shown us that being locked inside our home isn't a good experience . So it is the same way for animals, they belong in nature. So when a person takes them out of their natural habitat and keeps them in zoos they are a bad person. But thinking about the other side of the story, for kids it is good to learn about animals because the experience for them is gonna be so much better than an experience inside a class room . Having a clear opinion about this topic is very complicated because there are two sides of the coin and when you think about it in just one way maybe you are wrong.

Improvements are proved Have you ever wanted to improve your writing, but you didn't know where to start? If this seems familiar to you, Write and Improve might be the perfect tool for you to step up your writing skill and to impress others with your writing talent. I recently discovered their site, which is not only easily accessible but also completely free to use. How does this tool work and, more importantly, is it worth trying? The website, provided with a clear and neat interface, consists of different workbooks with writing exercises. Whatever level of English you have, there will be an appropriate workbook task for you. You can hand in your writing and you will immediately receive detailed feedback. Moreover, there is a timer function and a graph to track your writing progress. Hence, in my opinion, this tool is really beneficial for your language skills. The immediate checks make you more aware of the mistakes you make. In addition, the site provides you with advice on how to improve. To me, this tool was indeed really helpful for preparing for my Cambridge exam. However, it should be noted that the website doesn't mark all your spelling mistakes or grammatical errors. Therefore, it would be wise to also ask a teacher to check your work, instead of just relying on the tool. Likewise, sometimes they give unclear feedback, which makes it difficult to improve even more. Despite the tool not always working properly, I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their writing. To practice is the key to any skill and Write and Improve creates a great online learning environment for doing so. So, why don't you give it a go?

Firstly, thanks for the invite. Regarding the point you asked me to write about, I have a certainty: in the future, school won't be a place for teaching ideologies. In a few years, I want schools with good teachers, good staff, good students from different parts of the country, and most important of all: ethical people. Currently, when we turn on the television, we see many politicians, either from the left or from the right, express their opinions about the importance of school in order to make a good society. It is very wrong, because it's not up to politicians to decide what is the best way to teach kids. Moreover, we shouldn't forget that the education of people in the future is a matter for the parents, not the government because we live in a liberal society and this is a point that I don't want to forego.

Everybody usually likes to study in another country because they want more experience and a new culture. Well, I remember I also wanted to go to study abroad, but I didn't do that because I didn't have that much money - and studying abroad is very expensive - because I was from a poor family. So, secondly I will speak to you about the advantages of studying abroad: Advantages: 1- Gain more modern sciences. 2- Practicing new languages with other students. 3- Learning about different cultures. 3- Transfering opinions and experiences. Thirdly, the disadvantages of studying abroad. 1- Difficulty to understand a new society. 2- Students do not agree to come back to their countries. These are some reasons for studying abroad, please read it. Also, you can send me your feedback. Thank you so much. See you soon.

In this new school year, I feel very confident in some areas of my knowledge, like maths and science and that's because I have worked really hard to improve and get good grades in some subjects. I'm aware that I have to improve in some other areas like administration, communication, and history, but I've been working on that searching for information in books and on websites, trying to stay one step ahead of the teacher's class and of course always paying attention to the teacher in every single class. Whenever I don't understand something I'm always going to ask the teacher my questions. I need to put in some extra effort to be better, I won't ever surrender.

Learning a foreign language was very important in the past, but is it still important to learn a foreign language in these times? Yes, it is even more important to learn famous and recognised languages, like English, Spanish, Chinese, etc. But now with useful tools for translating words from one language to another language that you don't know, some people believe that it is not important to learn a language. That idea is very, very wrong. What happens if you need a word in another language that you don't know in your original language? Even with new languages you learn new words in your original language, and that is why it is important to know a language without any help from a robot. Because if you want to work in a recognised job you need at least an upper - intermediate foreign language level, and in an international exam you are not allowed to have a translator with you. If you want a better life, learning a language is a big step.

Hello everyone, When I was fifteen years old, I went to San Andres Islands with my family. My family was poor and they had saved money for years so we could travel there. We made that trip to celebrate my birthday. We were there for four days. We always remember that trip and all its adventures, it is impossible to forget. There we discovered Jonekey Island, which is beautiful. There are many and different fish species, the water is totally blue, its climate is very hot and the seafood is amazing. We spent the day swimming, eating, playing, laughing, and walking around rocks and the beach. On another day we walked around the island, we went to Morgan's cavern, a natural pool in the sea, it is five meters deep. People jumped in the pool and fishes got close to them to eat pieces of bread that they had in their hands. In addition, we went to a place that the natives named "El hoyo soplador." The place is a little dangerous because the water hits the rocks strongly and comes out through a hole. Then people get wet. If they want to run on the rocks, they can get hurt. In conclusion, we shared a wonderful experience, it was the best holiday of my life.

Television, a medium that appeared in the 1950s, is one of the most important inventions that changed our lives. Everyone knows that the main purpose of television is to entertain. But have you ever wondered: "Can it also educate?" From my point of view, it definitely can. How can television educate? Through the programs shown on it. When I was a kid, there was an educational program shown every morning. It lasted for 30 minutes and it provided some math lessons for children. Nowadays, more and more programs are produced to teach students math, geography, science,... Even cartoons can play that role. For example, Tom and Jerry teach children how to be a good guy. As you can see, now we are dealing with COVID-19. Students can't go to school. Therefore, in many countries, television is used to teach the students while they're at home. In a nutshell, there's no way that a television can't educate. Television has the potential to do that. It depends on the way we use it.

Nowadays, most students decide to study overseas for a while. Studying in another country has some pros and cons, and I will argue both sides in this essay. The main reason to choose to study abroad is to broaden your horizons. People who go abroad could gain new experiences and face a new culture to deal with. For example, students who are living overseas could learn to adapt themselves to new situations and think more rationally about their surroundings. Secondly, moving away helps students to learn a new language and give them a good opportunity to do research with a large range of references. Moreover, dealing with a new language increases their brain capacity as well. Turning to the other side of the argument, there are some drawbacks to studying abroad. The main disadvantage is culture shock. Students might face new people who are not familiar with them and this makes them feel lonely. It is not possible for them to cope with this new condition easily. The other problem that must be mentioned is students have to start from scratch. It means they must start a new life and it is possible that they have to live with little money at first. Also, they might get a student loan to pay for university fees. In conclusion, although there are some considerable pros to moving away to study, there are some disadvantages to consider carefully. Living abroad could open students' minds and also improve their language skills. On the other hand, they might not adapt themselves to the new place quickly and also have difficult financial problems.

Television is one of the most popular tools for amusing people, also for teaching the world new things. In my opinion, the side of entertaining people outweighs the educational aims. The main aim of TV is broadcasting entertaining programs. Firstly, people want to be amazed. For example, there are a lot of movie genres like comedy and action and TV shows on television that can create a lot of fun for individuals and help them to relax after a hard day. Secondly, television is a great deal cheaper than going to the cinema or theater. Finally, people like watching their favourite celebrities, such as actors or actresses, sportsmen or sportswomen, and singers on TV. On the other hand, educationally speaking, there are some programs which are designed for students and help them based on their curriculums. The other argument is related to having a good access to TV for poor people. And the final argument for using television to educate is the lower costs of the educational programs. In conclusion, although people watch TV to have a good time, they can learn in their free time.

The educational environment is a major concern when people decide where to study. So, many students prefer to study abroad because of many advantages. However, there are still inevitable drawbacks when studying in foreign countries. On the one hand, studying abroad is beneficial. If a student goes to a foreign country to study, he or she will approach a new culture. Students will see a lot of stuff which they have not seen before. So they can learn new things and might end up with new ideas, which can be applied to their nations. Besides, studying abroad might be a good way to advertise the human resources of a nation. Students who represent their countries when going abroad might attract foreign investments and collaboration by showing their talent, making friends, and working to help the country they are studying in. After that, they can contribute to the development of their countries. On the other hand, studying abroad might bring some disadvantages. Firstly, intellectual losses are a big concern. Many talented students who study overseas will never come back to their nations after finishing their programs because they will receive more benefits when working in the foreign country they studied in. Secondly, it might take a large amount of money to study abroad. Many students cannot afford that. There are still many drawbacks, such as language barriers and cultural shock.

Many species of animals are kept in zoos where people can visit them and learn about them. All over the world, this kind of place is very common, moreover, it is a tourist place where people spend all day looking at the animals in their cages. In my opinion, animals belong in nature and it is not a good idea to keep them in zoos because in this way they do not have freedom and they depend on human beings to reproduce and even to eat. On the other hand, some species would be extinct if man did not do anything to keep them alive due to the ecological imbalance that has been caused by humans. To sum up, I do not agree with animals in zoos for the entertainment of people, but we need to do something to help the animals. Human beings are at the top of the food chain, but it is very important to know how to protect animals and live with them in this world that is being destroyed by humans.

Now I'm going to express my opinion about this astonishing website. It was a nice surprise to find that this website could correct all your mistakes when you are writing a text. As well as that, the texts of this place are similar to the texts of the Cambrige exam, so personally, I think that it is very fleauless and useful.

As you know, we are now living in a globalized world so some students choose to study abroad for a time during high school or university. However, there are advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad. There are many advantages of studying abroad. Firstly, the students will be studying updated and quality education programs. Secondly, they are taught by lecturers who are qualified. Besides that, the students will live in a different culture where they can exchange things and learn about each other by themselves. On the other hand, studying abroad has many disadvantages. The students need to pay more money for accommodation, food, and the cost of their studies. Besides that, they are far from their family so that they do not have close support from them. In the case of students who are high school graduates, it will affect them as they grow up without their families caring for them. One more disadvantage is the weather, for instance, England is too cold and wet for students who come from tropical countries. In conclusion, studying abroad is a good opportunity for students to get better knowledge and skills to develop their future career.

Three years ago, I went for the first time to Los Angeles on Christmas day. It was really important for me because I met people with whom I share family and I needed to know them. I saw a lot of things, like how people live in the USA, how they work, and how they have fun. I visited a lot of places, like Big Beard mountain. That place was really snow-covered, but it was a nice place to do some snow sports. I went to San Francisco, a very nice city and I visited the Golden Gate bridge, which is an amazing bridge. I saw the famous prison Alcatraz too, but the place that I liked most was Santa Monica pier because it's a place that I only knew from pictures and video games, and I think that's an emblematic place that everyone knows. Walking along the beach was an amazing feeling for me because I was finally in a place that I always wanted to be in.

Nowadays, video games are very popular, especially with children. They were born during the 90's, becoming more and more popular in the following years. The secret behind this success has different reasons. The first reason is the amount of different games that we currently have, starting from football games up to war games. The second reason is the graphics, in fact today's video games are becoming very similar to real life in terms of characters and scenarios. Their success has brought many problems in our life, especially for parents. In fact they attract the attention of children more and more easily. I think that a right amount of these games could be good for children because in this way they can stay away from something with danger, like drugs for example, and at the same time playing with them can teach children how to face life's challenges. On the other hand, using video games too much could be dangerous for children in terms of health. A negative aspect regarding the effects of some games on children is that they can have a negative influence on their behavior. I think parents have the responsibility to check on children as well as possible in order to let them to play with video games but not too much. In my opinion, we need to teach children that reading a book is always much better than playing with video games.

Nowadays doing exercise is becoming more and more popular. Many studies have shown that a reasonable amount of exercise can improve your health, so more and more people are starting to change their habits. I held a class discussion on the importance of this topic just a few days ago. There were a lot of different opinions about this topic, especially how to do it and if it was the most important thing in life. This is always a tricky problem, because like everything in life the important thing is the balance. If you spend the whole day doing exercise you will not have time for your family, for your girlfriend or boyfriend, or for your friends. If you spend your time only on exercise probably you will always lose something in terms of friendship or love. On the other hand, if you don't dedicate a bit of your time to exercise you damage your health, in particular when you become older. For these reasons, as I said before, the secret of this tricky problem is the balance. So in other words you have to take time for yourself, but also for your affections.

In my opinion, I think it isn't good to have the same teacher for several years. The best option is to look for a new teacher, because I think every teacher has a different way of teaching. If you have the same teacher for several years, perhaps you don't improve a lot or you don't reach your full capacity, your teacher and you stay in a comfort zone. In my experience, I have had a lot of teachers, every year I had a new teacher, and I improved a lot every year. Every teacher taught me in different ways and I practiced the clues and methods of my old teacher with my new teacher every year. When you have a bad teacher, you can't wait to finish the class and the English course, but when you have a good teacher, you don't want the class to finish. I would like to choose some old teachers again, but sometimes it's impossible, because they don't have enough time.

This pandemic is teaching us that it is more important to be healthy than rich, but do people consider this true? No, because politicians and important people continue thinking about money. Because of this pandemic, loads of countries made all citizens stay at home for more than 100 days, then, when the cases of this pandemic decreased the politicians started opening lots of places that were closed for the quarantine. The cases started to grow again and the politicians continued opening the industry and some companies that produce a lot of money, like banks, mining companies, etc. They want to earn money in this pandemic for themselves, not for the employees, only for the managers of those companies. Lots of people are only thinking about their money instead of the rest of the important things in life. Rich and famous people died in this pandemic and they had a lot of money. To change it , we need a lot of time, but we can change it, thinking of more important things than money. Only a very insignificant action can change the future.

We are living in a digital era where video games are developing rapidly. How video game playing impacts children is an argument among their parents. From my point of view, playing video games will have both positive and negative impacts on the children. The positive of playing video games is that it's developing children’s brains. It makes them more innovative. Besides, playing video games is a way to reduce stress. On the other hand, playing video games also has many negative impacts. The first is that the children waste time and money on playing video games. The second is the children’s health problems such as eye defects. Their sight worsens because of the time sitting in front of a screen. Besides, video game playing makes children's behaviour ruder and more aggressive. The worst negative impact is the addiction to playing video games. For example, children are likely to imitate the games they played. Many teenage crimes committed are the result of game addiction. In conclusion, children playing video games has both positive and negative impacts. How their parents face up to those impacts is important. Their control of the time and content of the video games played will have a positive impact on their children.

I need to learn English. Another reason is that most of the important countries accept either their own language or English. Learning a lot of languages is more difficult that learning only English. I want to leave my country to live in a better society, I need to learn English. Finally, if I don't want to have any of these things, to communicate with a foreign person that could come to my city and ask me for help I need to know a foreign language to communicate with him or her.

Having different teachers is probably good for students with certain capabilities, such as being sociable, having a good understanding, being autodidacts, etc. Because they can adapt to the changes and challenges in class or the way of teaching of a new teacher. This is good because each teacher has a different way of giving a class. For example, the class management, the development of the topics, and the resolution of problems and answers. This is very important to impart their knowledge. However, for many students this is difficult, due to the fact that they are timid and they have not developed the ability to interact with other people, so they take a lot of time to get accustomed to a new teacher. And this is a problem for the teacher because they do not integrate in the class. Normally, these pupils need a special focus and their classmates should help them to have an enjoyable course.

Video games are an excellent way to spend children's free time. However, this becomes a problem when children do not want to do other activities and their time in front of a video game console becomes too much. The video games could alter their mood, and sometimes many children present violent behavior due to a lack of sleep, malnutrition because of not eating well, and they could have nightmares and sleep disorders. In my opinion, video games are not bad if the time is supervised by the parents and they are encouraged to develop other activities, such as sports, household chores, caring for pets, going out to the park, doing exercise, etc. In addition, the other activities can help them in their mental and physical health. It depends on the stability of the family nucleus, and I believe that these are measures that must be taken to take care of their health.

Zoos are incredible and excellent places for the animals that are in danger of extinction and animals that were born in conditions of captivity because there the caregivers take care of their health. And these animals could not survive in a wild place due to natural threats, such as being part of the food chain and hunters. Some zoos have the conditions and the capabilities for the maintenance of these animals, and this is very good. However, others zoos have deplorable and precarious conditions for their species, and their bad behavior with their animals could provoke their death. In this case, keeping animals in these zoos is wrong because the animals should be dealt with responsibly and amicably, and with specific care and good food, under the care of vets. If these animals do not return to the wild they should take them to other zoos, where they are treated better.

Nowadays we have airplanes, high-speed trains, cars, and trucks with huge motors, etc. But what ways of travel will exist in future?. Our imagination can give us an idea. I think that travelling could be at a higher speed and going to places and other will be faster. The fuel should change. I think about vehicles that employ hot air for example, and so gas will not be necessary. In this age, we use gas and diesel, but these increase pollution, although the use of other alternative fuels is also important, such as ethanol and bio-fuels. I believe that vehicles will be different in the future, maybe the development of drones with a high capacity and a strong frame could be transporting a lot of weight. And many people could travel to each destination.

Nowadays medical doctors are mainly working around urban areas, this trend might be associated with a better salary. However, there is a growing demand for doctors in rural areas that are not possible to reach. There are many reasons that explain this tendency along with several proposals to tackle it. One of the biggest problems is medicine is evolving dramatically. As a result, doctors need to be up to date, and for this, they should study at universities or colleges that are always located in cities. On the other hand, doctors have to compete for a place to be a consultant, while there are only a few places available, and these places are highly competitive. In addition, the income in cities could be higher compared to rural areas, and obviously this is a key factor to take into account. On the other hand, this trend is generating a lack of doctors in rural areas. In fact, according to the Health Department, there are many hospitals without a doctor. That situation is worsening with the time and patients are struggling to find a health provider near their towns. The inequality between rural and urban jobs in the health sector should be tackled by health departments and universities. One solution could be to develop a way that young doctors can study rural medicine and also have good salaries, as well as offering a continuing development for their careers.

My trip to the Maldives with my family was the best holiday I ever had. This was an important trip for my family because we had had no chance to be together for a long time.

There were many incredible beaches stretching for a few kilometers long, with blue sea, white sand, and green coconut trees. In summer, the Maldives is the most interesting place for people to come to relax and surf. My family stayed in a cottage near the beach where you can see warm sunlight when the sun rises. It was peaceful when we were having dinner together on the beach. Moreover, we had some short trip to discover caves near there by boat. Those caves are beautiful.

Nowadays, more and more students decide to study in another country for a certain time. It is becoming a sort of fashion, but sometimes the students have strong reasons to do it. The decision to study abroad can have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages can be both for your career and for your culture. A positive aspect when you study in another country is that you can learn another language, which can be useful in terms of your career when you find a job. Another positive aspect is the opportunity to discover other cultures and traditions that can improve you as a person. The disadvantages are due to being away from your family and if you are very young this can be a very difficult thing to put up with. However, in my opinion the advantages are more than the disadvantages because an experience like this can help you to grow faster and to face life in the best way.

In my opinion, it is always important, but it depends on what language you would like to learn. For example, these days the English language is very important. But if you would like to learn a language that just a few people use it will be a waste of your time. So, in my opinion you have to learn English. And if you would like to learn an extra language, you need at first to know how many people speak this language and if it is easy or not. This is an important thing because if the language is hard you will take a lot of time to learn it and this is maybe not good. So in my opinion, if you would like to learn a new language look at a language that is famous and easy for your mother language. I will explain. My mother language is Arabic, so for me, the English language is okay, not hard and not easy either. But if my mother language were Korean for me the English language would be very hard.

To be honest, I basically don't like to exercise but I have to do it for my health. I do exercise every day. I don't have a fixed schedule to take exercise, it depends on my free time. As a high school student, I can't afford to exercise at a gym. Therefore, I do exercise outside. Jogging is my favourite exercise. I enjoy jogging every evening. My mom tends to suggest skipping. But I always refuse to do it as I don't want to be covered in sweat. As I said before, strenuous exercise is not my thing. I only enjoy light exercise, like jogging, dancing and yoga.

I don't like my children to play video games. I think they never learn anything. They spend a lot of time playing video games that could be spent reading books, watching documentaries, or playing with their friends. Some people think that playing video games has positive effects on children's brains, because they improve their imagination and creativity. However, some video games could offer good effects on creativity and imagination, but only a few of them. My children's friends played a lot of video games and they obtained bad results at school, they lost their friends, and changed their behaviour . They have spent a lot of time at the doctor's, trying to rectify their behaviour. Moreover, they are spending a lot of money. I prefer my children to spend time reading books, playing with friends and family, and walking in the forest. When I find an educational video game I'm going to let them play video games. Do you agree?

I have been on my journey of improving my English writing for 1 month. I made the decision that I should improve my English writing this year. I decided to improve my English writing because I want to pass the IELTS English test. The first thing I did was I surfed the internet and searched for a method and tips that could help me to work easily and efficiently without wasting my time with a bad start and then feel disappointed. Due to what I found on YouTube I started to practise. First, I started with an easy task, I wrote about with simple words. Second, after two weeks I changed to a site named Write & Improve, it's an amazing site. It goes from beginner level to advanced level with several subjects. It asks you to write about them. Furthermore, I started to also read in English (books, articles, blogs...) to increase my vocabulary. On this journey, I hate to write about subjects I don't like, or subjects different from those I know about. Finally, I advise you to start to improve your writing skills with something you enjoy when you write about it. Write about topics that you love and interest you.

Having the same teacher for several years is good for students, some believe that on the other hand having new teachers each year is more beneficial. In my opinion, I think the best is to have a new teacher each year. The first reason is that it is better for a student to learn from different methods of study to know what the best way to learn is and prepare themselves to fit in with changes, because in real life they will live in a world that changes every day, there is nothing constant. Every day new things appear and things disappear. Second, this helps them to know more things, because maybe the teacher who taught them before didn't tell them about a topic because he also didn't know. Third, it is good to change the environment and students don't stay everyday see this teacher or that this makes a student feel bored because there is nothing new that will happen today. They start to know the routine and the next action of the teacher even before he starts to do it. Maybe this method has some negatives, but in my opinion it is still better than the others believe.

Nowadays, it is very common that some students choose to study in another country during high school or university. It is very important when someone is learning a new language, he or she can has contact with not only the language, but also the culture, and living abroad is a great experience for anyone who wants to learn about the language and the culture of another country. On the other hand, students who choose to study abroad can lose some opportunities in their country. Students might have to redo their school year because the subject in another country is totally different and perhaps a student from university can miss a job opportunity in that year that he is travelling. To sum up, it is a great chance when someone can study overseas. It is not an opportunity that all people can afford because it is very expensive and even if students can stop their lives for one year or more, it will be a terrific experience and it will be very important for their resumé and personal experience.

A month ago, I asked my English teacher, Mrs. Gomax what I should do to improve my English writing skills. Then, she suggested that I should try a website named Write&Improve, which is sponsored by Cambridge University . So, I tried it and found it useful for me. Once you enter the website , you can choose the level you would like to join. There are three levels, which are beginner , intermediate, and advanced. You can freely go for a suitable level according to the ability you have with your English . You can also create an account . It then gives you the topics that you have to write about . For example, let us say you choose the beginner level , you can see the different topics with questions . If you are going to write, click the question, write the answer, and then submit it when you are finished. It is really useful for me. I feel that my writing has improved within a month. And I like the way they motivate the students . When your writing is finished , they give you some feedback and an award if you reach the goal they set. You can see your progress on the progress graph as well. That is my favourite part as I can see my progress day by day. I like all the functions included in it, except one thing - which is it can't correct each of your mistakes exactly. However, I would like to recommend this website to my classmates who wish to improve their writing. I am sure that you will all see good results.

Nowadays doctors are not tempted to move into the country as they were back in the day. Cities are not dirty places anymore and instead physicians are greeted with a generous income and a wide offer of free-time activities. But essentially there are more potential patients in a rather tight space, allowing the doctors to abandon long trips to bedridden patients. As a result you don't waste too much time driving around, which you could also use to cure even more patients in a day. You see: money is the key. To solve the problem of doctor-shortage in the country you have to attract physicians by securing them extra help from the authorities. For instance you could offer them special conditions for the building process of their doctor's offices. Alternatively they could be provided with lower running taxes or prices for their equipment. Another option would be to give more places at universities to aspiring students of medicine who consent to work for a certain period in rural areas after their studies.

I like zoos very much, I think you can enjoy them a lot with your children. They can learn a lot about wild animals there. When I was a child, I enjoyed them a lot and I want my children to enjoy them as well. There are people that don't like them because they think that animals suffer a lot when they don't live in their natural environment. I do not agree with them. The animals grow up in a good environment, they have a fair treatment. They are born, grow, and die in the zoo. When you go to the zoo, you learn a lot of things about the lifestyle of animals and you learn to respect them. I think the damage done to the animals is very low if you compare the benefits. There are many animals that are suffering because they live in a circus, and you cannot compare them. The animals in a circus have the wrong lifestyle and animal activists think there are the same.

My best holidays ever were in Mallorca, when I was seventeen. I was with my family, my parents and my two brothers, and it was amazing... I enjoyed it a lot. We were living in a big house with a beautiful garden, a huge swimming pool, and two minutes from the beach. We spent a lot of time in the swimming pool, in the garden, and at the beach. We met many people from different countries and different Spanish regions. We spent one month in Mallorca. Every morning, we had breakfast in the garden and every day we had a meal and dinner in different restaurants on the island. We went to Ibiza for two days, where we travelled around the island and enjoyed it a lot... its beaches, its sun, its restaurants. I would like to repeat the same experience with my children and for them to enjoy it like I did. I have good memories of Mallorca and I don't want lose them.

In this new school year I will be very pleased with learning about English literature and about grammar. Grammar is my favourite subject and I will really appreciate studying it, since it is a very difficult area of knowledge for many students and even teachers have some difficulties with that. Besides that, I would like to improve my writing and my pronunciation of the English language. It is very hard for a foreign student to learn a second language and now, in this program, I have the opportunity to do that. To sum up, in order to achieve my goals I will do my best and I will study hard as well. I would like to enjoy this opportunity and I am sure that it will be a long way to improving my skills, but I know that I can do it and with this help it will definitely be easier and I will certainly develop my skills for sure.

The best holiday that I ever had was in January, 2006. My husband and I had decided to get married in this month because we wanted to celebrate our engagement in our parents' town, since we had been living 6 hours away from them. Another reason to choose the date and the place was because we had a lot of friends in common that were spending that holiday with their relatives. All our friends had gone to another city to work, so we could only meet them in holidays and vacations. It was an amazing party, with our whole family and most of our friends. I wore a beautiful dress and my husband and I invited 400 people. After the party, we spent the night in a hotel and we had lunch with our family in the same place where the party took place because a lot of people had lunch with us. After some days, we went back to our apartment and now almost 15 years later, we live in a nice house, in another city, with two daughters and one fish.

In my country, Myanmar, it takes time for teachers to be changed from one school to another. Because they have to serve at the same school for about four or five years to be promoted. So, I rarely experience being taught by different teachers. I don't know the differences well between having new teachers and the same teacher each year. I believe that both have positive and negative effects. Some students, they like having the same teacher for several years because they are accustomed to his or her teaching methods and they like it. But, to be honest, I really would like to be taught by new teachers each year. In my opinion, having new teachers will give us something new to learn. For example, supposing we do not like the teacher teaching now, then we can expect another one to be better next year and his or her teaching methods may be way better or may be more fun. As I mentioned before , we could learn something different from her and she can encourage us to be interested in the school lessons, I think. On the other hand, the new teacher might be worse at teaching. However, I'd like to have a new teacher each year as I wish to be taught with different teaching methods by different teachers.

There is no doubt that volunteer work these days has became a famous job as people have become more sensitive and caring about the people around them. However, the question is: is it suitable to have volunteer work as a requirement for graduating from high school? In this essay I am going to discuss this phenomenon from both points of view. On one side of the argument, we have people who argue that forcing our children to volunteer is a considerably bad thing to do. People believe that the essence of volunteer work lies in our intention. For instance, some students might not be willing to volunteer so when we make them work arbitrarily they are going to hate it and in this case we lose what the meaning of this work really is, which is to give all you can unconditionally and with passion. Moreover, on the other hand people argue that making our students work voluntarily could benefit many people and at the same time we teach our students to have loads of experience in such field, which will benefit them in the long run. A good example here is that they will learn how to be patient, control time and to respect people. Learning these work skills would make your life easier. Finally, we could say that forcing our students may not be the right decision. Instead, we could tell them the importance of this world and leave it as an alternative.

Living in the twenty-first century, the age of IT, all children play video games except the poorest of the poor. Because the poor can't afford to buy video game equipment. Video games are frowned on by parents as time-waster, and worse, some education experts think that these games corrupt the brain. They can affect children's development and health when they are played exceedingly. Some experts have said that some young people become violent or commit extreme anti-social behaviour because of playing games. Some children spend their time playing games alone in their own room instead of hanging out with friends. It can affect their cognitive development unless they go out and socialize in the real world. This can also impair their eyesight. Contrary to the common view, video games have some positive effects when they are played moderately. There are many types of games made for varied purposes —some can be entertaining and relaxing while others can be challenging and good for learning. Some games can improve children's development, such as making decision in a short period of time and critical thinking skills. It seems to me that parents should not forbid children from playing games. Instead they can help them enjoy video games properly and avoid problems.

Dear Mayor, Dear Members of the Town Council, With this letter, I'd like to express my opinion about your latest decision regarding mobile phones. I don't think it's up to you to decide such things. You can't - and moreover you shouldn't - stop people from using their mobile phones while they are on public transport or in shops and restaurants. They can use their mobile phones because they don't disturb anyone. Of course, the volume has to be switched off, in order to respect everyone's space. Instead, you should ban the use of mobile phones while people are walking or cycling in the streets. This would be really useful to prevent and avoid accidents: when people are on the street, they have to be focused on what they're doing, otherwise the situation becomes really dangerous. You should ban mobile phones also in those places, such as cinemas and theatres, where it is dark and even the smallest light can disturb those around us. There's no sense banning mobile phones from public transport if people can use them just outside their doors, maybe while crossing the street. Mobile phones are not the problem, people are. You should run campaigns that encourage people to use their mobile phones less and live more in real life by teaching them that the real world is outside of their smartphones. People do not learn from prohibitions, but from teachings, explanations and examples. I beg you to retrace your steps to find a better and effective solution. Best regards, A citizen

It is very important to do some exercise for our health and a lot of people do not do that because in their opinion it is very boring and tiring. Some people prefer hanging out with friends or even watching television to doing some kind of exercise. On the other hand, although exercise is not attractive for some people, others love it and they are obsessed with it in a certain way that they can't control and they forget everything in their lives because of that. There are a lot of competitions for those that like to show off their bodies and muscles. Also, there are a lot of products in the market that promise to improve your physical condition. To sum up, it is necessary to do some kind of exercise. Remember that it is not necessary to go to the gym, maybe someone can find a fun activity such as dancing, doing a sport, or swimming. There are a lot different activities that any person can do to exercise without taking notice of it.

Hello everyone, I think exercise is very important for our health because it permits our body to keep its metabolism. If people do exercise they have a beautiful skin, the hair and nails are attractive, the muscles grow, and the brain and the organs work properly. Otherwise, if people don't do exercise they will have health problems over time, the muscles will atrophy and it's more difficult to keep the metabolism healthy. However, it's more important for our health to have good eating habits so the body can work properly and keep the functions of all the organs. Investigations have even demonstrated that people who eat healthily live for a lot of years and preserve their youth. No doubt, another important thing is to be calm because stress causes health issues due to people not being able to rest properly. The brain is disrupted and the organs work inadequately, which causes nervousness and heart, kidney, muscle, and skin problems. It's important to know that doing exercise helps to relieve stress and stay calm in different situations. In conclusion, doing exercise is important for our health, but is the sum of several factors which allows us to have good health.

Except for in the affluent countries like the US, students in poor countries wish to study abroad. They believe that the education system is much better than in their country. Lagging behind the students of Western countries, most students in Asian countries are trying to go abroad and study there. Not only the undergraduates but also the graduates go abroad to get a job with a high salary because they know that their government is not able to create a special post for them. But some students do not want to go abroad as they are not accustomed to the culture and something like that. From my point of view, I want to study abroad and serve my country. As you know, studying abroad is not easy, you will experience culture shock certainly. You have to habituate to their food, culture, and weather. Worse than that, you might be bullied. To the best of my knowledge, it has been said that some Western people discriminate against Asian people because of the race or ethnicity. On the other hand, there are a lot of advantages of studying abroad. As you have to learn their language, you will become bilingual. And you get to know their culture and lifestyle. You begin to know the difference between your country and their country. You will get a ton of knowledge since you can see and learn many different things from them. And with that knowledge, you can serve and strive for your native country's development.

Speaking for myself, it is more effective if the space is more or less open. In the perfect office there should not be any walls or things similar to them which separate working spaces . One simple reason is that makes it easier to communicate with other workers in the office, which helps to keep the information flow running smoothly. In addition, the open space will create a better atmosphere in general, which can increase morale and productivity. Every wall is an potential unused space that could be used for another coworker to do their work. Some people are afraid of having not enough space, as a result of a crowded area is those people are more likely to get sick. When workers are sick the enterprise loses a lot of manpower and money. Generally speaking, walls are just a waste of space and make people uncomfortable. Last but not least, it gives some employees a false feeling of privacy, which can tempt people to feel at home and then start doing private stuff at work. The isolated people between walls are more likely to break rules, because no one can see them there.

In the future, with the development of technology, we won't just go around the Earth but also fly into space. Now, we can fly to anywhere on Earth within a day to enjoy a delicious meal and relax in a luxury hotel. But there are still a lot of people that dream of going beyond the sky, into the dark space. Technology has developed rapidly for a couple of decades, in a few more decades we can see the cost of travelling to space will drop significantly. More and more people can go into space, people may have a honeymoon on the moon. Instead of using planes we may use rockets to go around, checking in in space may become a new trend. In spite of new ways of travelling, the core attributes of travel will still remain the same. They are the curiosity of a person about a new place, the experience that travelers want to have, and the desire to explore new areas. The future is unpredictable, who know where we can travel to?

Living being completely honest is the hardest thing in my life. Not because I want to lie to people, but because people don't want to hear what they don't expect to. I am one of those people who refuse to lie, but this shape of my personality caused me a lot of problems for all my life. I've never been able to pretend to be a friend of someone, nor to support an idea I didn't share, nor to adapt to something I totally disagreed with. But living in complete honesty, always telling the truth, is very hard and sometimes it becomes impossible, because the consequences of the truth would be true disasters, not only for me, but also for other people. I can't stand the idea of making someone suffer with my truth or honesty, nor creating serious problems. For example, I can't tell my boss that one of my colleagues isn't doing his job properly, because he would be fired, and I don't want this responsibility on me. I can't tell my mother-in-law that her daughter is growing up clueless, because she would never let me into her house again. My choice is to avoid situations that don't make me feel comfortable, to preserve a civil and pacific relationship with everyone, and to tell a half truth when it is impossible to stay quiet. When it is impossible to say a half truth, I always choose the truth. I don't believe in lies, they are just a way to escape from responsibilities.

There is a conflict between books and technology nowadays. The reasons are many, such as prices and the quality of the products. I personally do not think that computers and tablets should replace books in school because it can be very expensive for a family to buy these technologies. Reading a book is 100 times better than reading a story on a tablet because you can not enjoy them like a real book. Also giving a tablet to students would mean giving the chance to play video games in schools while teachers are talking. This already happens today with smartphones. Books are also useful to take notes, which are important in a student's life, or you can underline important paragraphs in order to have a better understanding of the topic which you are going to study. Technologies are not useful for the teacher because a lot of them do not know how to use a modern phone, PC, and so on. I personally think that using a book is the best way to teach in these and future days.

Every student should have the possibility to choose where to study. Most of them can't do it, because going to study abroad is very expensive. Obtaining a room in universities' campuses is quite difficult, because there is a limited number of available rooms. Therefore, many families have no alternative but to rent a room. A room can cost around 400,00 euros per month in normal cities, but in the most expensive ones, such as Milan, prices are around 700,00-800,00 euros per month. Moreover, despite being public, university has taxes to be paid, whose amount is based on the annual salary of the family. The problem is that the threshold under which people don't pay is very low and a normal family needs at least 2.000,00 euros per year to pay university taxes. In addition to that, there is material to be bought: a pen is always a pen of course, but a book can even cost 60,00 euros. When I was at university, every exam required at least three books to study. There is also the bus pass to pay. In the end, it is obvious that studying abroad is an economic choice: those who can do it, do it, those who can't, don't. I chose to remain because luckily my city offered me the university course I wanted and because I didn't want to leave my family, my boyfriend and my cat, whom I'm very close to. Probably, in other conditions, I would have gone away, to a foreign country, to learn the language, to open my mind, to grow up. Certainly, studying abroad forces you to grow up because you're alone, but it is necessary to be a responsible person, a condition too rare nowadays. Living alone doesn't mean living without rules, but it's a chance to follow our own path.

Office design There is no doubt that one of the important places that people stay in for a long period of their days is their work place. Therefore, it should be designed in a way that makes you feel comfortable and ready to accomplish your duty. However, in this article I am going to examine various types of office designs. Firstly, one famous design is known as the open design, where there are no walls to separate different desks, so all workers work in one huge hall. Also, many employees say that this type of design has many disadvantages for them, one of which is that sometimes the workplace becomes so annoying because of the amount of people and the noises make you work insufficiently. Moreover, these days workplaces in different firms have considered their design to be like this one, which may affect several workers. Secondly, there are enclosed offices in which many workers feel comfortable and happy while working in such a design. These employees like this pattern for many reasons. For instance, it provides their own space where they feel free to work without any disturbing noises. Therefore, their work would be done efficiently and in good time. Finally, we could say that different places and their designs could massively affect the workers' job. So we need to focus on this fact if we want to succeed in our business.

Life Choices There is no doubt that we all wish to live a happy and long life. However, the question is: if you can make a choice, would you like to live a long calm life or an intensive short one? In this article I am going to write my own opinion with examples. Firstly, my opinion is that I would like to live a short life but one which is filled with excitement and different adventures. The main reason why I chose this option is simply because I want to try, I believe it would be wonderful. As my life now is kind of calm, so I think it would be good for me to change it. Besides, it is better to live and have a great life than to get old and have nothing to do. However, some people may have another opinion. Those people think that living a long calm life would be much better than living a short one. Moreover, they argue that living a long life means to have children of your own and to raise them alongside of your husband and to grow old with them. Those people believe that there is no other thing in this life that could be compared to this precious moment. Finally, we could say that people have various personalities and whether you disagree with them or not, it doesn't matter, because different individuals have different circumstances than yours.

First of all, I discovered this useful tool while I was browsing, and I decided to try and see how it worked. So, the first thing I watched was the tutorial video, about the benefits, how the program works, some recommendations, and other functions. Since the beginning I have liked it because when I clicked on the link and at the top of the screen there appeared a small message according to which I had to decide my level. After that, I had an activity in which the program gave me a topic and there was a space to write about it. Apart from that, I like that there are so many useful tools on the screen, for example, the timer which helps you to check the time it takes to write an essay or report, and the chart where you can see your graph of progress after a revision. I really like this last thing because that helps me get an idea of how I'm improving along the way. Another thing that I like is the fact that there's a space for the feedback, in which the program shows what is wrong in the text. It could be grammar, spelling, or about connectors, and so on; however, I don´t really like the way the results come into view because it's kind of difficult to understand the symbols, so it took me a little bit of time to make my changes. Nevertheless, this program has so many good things and one of them, which I really like, is that after you finish your text it tells you in which level you are, so you can practise other activities according to your level. Finally, in my opinion I'd recommend "Write and Improve" because it's an amazing tool. It's really useful to improve your writing skills in order to prepare yourself for your next test. On top of that, it has a beautiful design and it's easy to understand.

Hello teacher, hello everybody, Today, I will tell you about the new school year. First, I hope to meet all my classmates in the new school year after coming back from the holiday. Also, I am missing all my friends. Well, I like English class, math, and history, but I don't like physics, I think it is more difficult. Second, I want to improve in my languages, English especially , I feel still weak in this language. So, I also want to improve in music class because I can't play the piano.

From my perspective, living a long and calm life with meaningful work is better than a shorter life, but genuinely our life is based on Allah willing, to illustrate that living a quite life without conflects and giving judgmnet on first impression you saw from others. living in calm environments in good relationships with people exchanged respect, to illustrate that living a quiet life without conflicts and giving judgment on the first impression you see in others, living in calm environments in good relationships with people exchanging respect, avoids intense situations leading to misbehaviour or misunderstanding. Calming down makes a balance in your life and a clear atmosphere to concentrate on your life. Sometimes we need a tough situation to learn from it and educate ourselves in intense moments to bear the pressure that comes from them. A short life differs from a long life, why is that? Obviously intensity already made our life short, when we take everything seriously and put ourselves in complex situations without spending time on analysing every single point to make a decision or plan our life, such as what our goals are, how much time we need and how we arrange the priorities in our life, that will be a hard life. I think the vast majority of people prefer calm to intensity, often the key to a beautiful life is calm in everything in your life. To conclude, the successful person working quietly that helps them to increase their productivity will live long, gain more, a high focus and comfortable thinking without any stressful moments.

Hi Elena! How're things? I'm trying to balance my everyday work with plenty of enjoyable activities! So, last Saturday I watched an award-winning film, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood." It's a drama about kindness and friendship, inspired by a true story and credibly directed by Marielle Heller. The film is set in 1998 and the hero is Mister Rogers, an amazing children's TV host whose role is played magnificently by Tom Hanks. All in all, it's worth seeing. I definitely recommend it! Write soon! Bye for now, Clara

Speaking personally, I think that having different teachers each year benefits students more because it means an opportunity to learn in many distinct ways. Besides, this brings about a good chance to know a new person who has diverse qualities and thoughts, which can be enriching for the students' personal and professional development. On top of that, if a student has a different teacher every year, he or she will likely develop his or her ability to adapt to the changes, which represents a great chance for the student's development. Furthermore, having a new teacher implies new challenges and new ways to learn or to explain a subject's topics. As a result, the students will be able to use a set of tools to learn better and they will feel enthusiastic about doing new exercises and activities. Apart from this, one of the advantages of having a different teacher is the motivation and inspiration that this can create in students. One instance could be when a teacher does new activities about a topic or when she asks the students to present a topic. These activities can make the students feel excited about the theme that is discussed. Moreover, every teacher has the chance to promote creativity in students through different dynamics in the classroom, such as collages, games, quizzes about some videos, and more. Conversely, when a student has the same teacher for several years, they would be unlikely to discover the way they learn and understand better or develop the skill of adapting to changes. Also, the student can stay in their comfort zone and lose their enthusiasm little by little because the student just gets accustomed to the routine and the way the professor teaches. In other words, there are no changes, no new ways, and probably no more challenges. Therefore, the best thing for students is to have a different teacher each year given that there are so many good effects, such as a higher level of motivation, useful tools to learn, skill development, and creativity in students being promoted.

English is an international language; it is the third-most-spoken language after only Mandarin and Spanish. In my mind, it is vital to have a command of this language for communication with other nationalities. International companies use this language to make trade agreements with other countries. Therefore, when I want to get a job, it is an advantage to have the ability to speak different languages. Besides, my main goal in learning, which is taking an international test, IELTS, the International English certificate, is essential for entering college or starting studies abroad; it is one of the requirements. Therefore, I'm studying English to start a new course in a foreign country. Another exciting aspect is that learning provides a high understanding of the world. The language is not separate from culture; contrariwise, it is a cultural element. I begin to understand the world from a different perspective. With the English view, I feel I'm immersing in new social rules, new concepts, and thoughts.

In my opinion, travel will be very different in the future. People will be able to arrive at their destination faster than now. The accidents that kill a lot of people will decrease because all drivers will be controlled by sophisticated computers avoiding mistakes in this way. Traffic will be much better because people will prefer to take public transportation to drive to work. Trains and buses will be comfortable and cheap. On the other hand, some people will spend a lot of money on visiting the moon or even visiting another planet. People who live far away from their family will be able to visit them in their own cars, which will take only a few hours because they will fly. To sum up, technology will help a lot of people have fun, spend more time with their family, and they will travel with safety and tranquility. A driver will be able to program a car and sleep until he arrives where he wants to because the automatic pilot will drive for him.

Health or wealth 'Health or wealth' is a subject everybody likes to discuss because if you are healthy, maybe you can have a better life, and vice versa, if you have wealth maybe you are healthy. Health is more important than wealth. Of course, we can't buy health with money. The statistics are clear that people that are healthy live longer and more happily than most rich people. The most important thing in our whole life is health, because without health we cannot do everything correctly, we cannot make a good decision. If a person is healthy, he or she could find a better job and consequently they can have a better life. But the question is if it is enough if someone has good health or they need another thing, e. g. money. I think maybe health is not enough for us, we need money because if you don't have money maybe your health will be endangered.

I think that nowadays our free time is a lot more precious than in the past. So, I really enjoy going hiking once or twice a month. There is always lots to be done outdoors in nature, from exploring the fantastic landscapes and fairytale woodlands to spotting amazing wildlife.

We all benefited from spending a bit of time out and getting some fresh air!

In my opinion, video games can have a positive impact when sensibly used. Indeed, virtual worlds may have a good impact by enabling young children to escape from a maybe boring or oppressive environment, or by making them deal with hard situations they might meet later in life. Besides, playing video games requires some skills other activities may not develop as much, such as leading a team, the capacity to adapt almost immediately, etc., which can be used afterwards in the "real world." Nevertheless, more and more parents complain about their children spending too much time in front of the computer, instead of working or playing sport. Others are scared by the lack of attention of their kids while talking or eating, because they had a game just before and are only concerned about whether or not they will win the next one. Such behaviour has been frequently reported about young kids. Videos games are therefore so attractive that they can become addictive, in which case the negative impact is huge. Sadly enough, more and more young people are concerned about this problem. Furthermore, an addiction to video games can lead to social and mental problems, such as difficulties to communicate, fear of the world and other people, etc. To conclude, I'd say that reasonably played, video games can have positive effects on children. But as soon as it becomes more of an addiction than a simple activity, it should be stopped and replaced by something else.

I do not know what kind of student I am, but I really enjoy going to school. As the new school year has come, I have a lot of ideas on my mind. I would like to do everything as well as I can as a student. As you know, there are six subjects that we have to learn in every grade. Among them English is the subject I like the most. I would like to be bilingual, so I have tried my best in order to write and speak English proficiently. Their culture really appeals to me. I wish our school also had music and PE classes like other countries since I am truly enthusiastic about music. Being that of a poor country, our government is not able to supply musical instruments to school. As the saying goes, " where there is a will, there is a way " , we can learn about music outside of the school. Sometimes, I thought to myself that I do not have the brain to do math. I am terribly bad at math. I have even cried because I can't do math. So, this year, I hope my math skills will improve. There is nothing I find difficult except math. My mother hired a math tutor for me last week. It has been said that setting a goal makes you more progressive in your learning. Thus, I make it a rule to sleep and get up early every day.

Achieving a goal helps you increase confidence and self-esteem. That is why I believe that I can make it a better school year.

The topic of my composition is the role of television in our life. Is television useful for education or for entertainment? I chose the topic because it is true that television has both roles. It is a good machine but with a bad master. A man has a brain and he has to use it. If he wants to be entertained or be educated by television it is up to him. I think that we can use television per programme. In the last few days I have tried to teach my children yoga. We are watching an online programme and we are doing exercises together like those on television. Now we can show many exercises in a row. A pigeon, a cat, or a mountain. We practise with our legs and stretch the joints. It is good for the body and the relationship with my daughters. I love them.

Studying at home is good for independent students who are self-confident, careful, and responsible. The school in the future will be about individual work and alternative ways of education.

Schools will be better in many ways, a teacher's work will be easy to do because they will be able to use electronic equipment and the students will have this equipment too, all this to facilitate the interchange of information. Besides, for students it will be easier to understand all their subjects because they will be able to see things, like how that knowledge is applied to real things that we use day by day thanks to the internet, computers, and phones.

Today, I am writing a new composition. The topic is the future of travel. What ways may be used in the future? I think public transport will be more effective and more ecological than today. We have to think of our children. Travelling by car is very comfortable today, in the future more ecological cars will be on the roads. The Tesla cars are examples of this. The automotive industry is very lucrative, it is about money and new technologies too in all states around the word. So travelling by car is one of the future ways. New in the ways of travelling is travelling to space. These days, the rockets from Elon Musk and others are tested for safety, comfort, and so on. Travelling to space will be for rich people but in the next decades it will be cheaper than today. It is odd that we can fly to space as a traveller. What can be next in line? Like in the story of Stargate, it will be travelling in time.

In some offices employees are in enclosed work stations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design. We are faced with two methods. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of a cubicle space is it is a place where employees can relax to work and it has fewer marginal items because you don't see other employees, but the disadvantages of cubicles are, after a while, employees feel tired because every day they see a enclosed work environment. The advantages and disadvantages of an open design are: an open design has the best view for employees and employees are not tired because they can easily connect with other employees. The people who work with a computer need to look far to relieve eye fatigue, so an enclosed work environment is bad for the eyes. I think an open design is better because employees cloud connect with each other easily, and employees can move around the office easily. the boss can easily connect with his employees and control them easily.

Well, I think this is an issue for debate because there are many elements to take into account in order to express an opinion. As for me, I think video games have a negative impact on children when they are too young and there are reasons for believing this. First of all, speaking personally I feel that nowadays there are so many kinds of video games, but the most popular video games are about violence and massacres, which increases the probability of aggressive behavior in children, such as bullying or being aggressive with their siblings. Then, one of the most crucial bad effects on children of playing video games is on their health because they spend a lot of time in front of a screen and as a result of this, it can damage their sight. Besides, the lack of physical activity has repercussions on their muscles and bones, as well as increasing the probabilities to be overweight. Apart from this, other negative consequences for children are the isolation and poor interpersonal skills due to children playing video games for long hours in closed spaces. They don't interact with other people, so they don't practise communicative abilities, which would bring about some problems in the short and long term at school, such as difficulties to make friends and challenges in teamwork, among others. Additionally, there are a lot of cases that have shown how children get so obsessed with video games that they try to do fewer things in their house or other activities which take up their valuable time. One instance could be where they just eat junk food and drink some sodas, which are not healthy, so as to save time. Another example is that they don't do their homework or don't study at home so that they can invest a lot more time to play video games; as a result of that they do poorly in school. Finally, it seems to me that video games are harmful for children's development, owing to the bad effects which I've already mentioned in personal, physical, and psychological aspects.

Television is not only for entertainment, it is also made for education. We can think about all of the TV shows that have been transmitted on television through all of these years. Genres like science and history are the most common topics. These TV shows can teach us about important things, like the history of humans, the universe, and world wars. There are even television shows that are more dedicated to teaching physics and maths in a more fun way. Television is a massive medium, if you want to send a message, for example, to the entire country, the best way to do it will be through television. So all governments pay a lot of attention to what kind of content is transmitted on television, most content must be educational, instead of entertainment. In my opinion, television is one of the best ways to learn things.

From my point of view, health is more important than wealth. To elaborate this for you, if I have a large amount of money and I have no health, there is no meaning to life.

To shed light on some points, sometimes money is essential to get health because poor people cannot pay for their treatment or get medicine.

The Write and Improve website is an incredible website for practising writing in English for English learners. Since I've started to write on this website, I've found that my English writing has improved tremendously. Whenever I practise writing English, often on this website, it brings back forgotten words to my memory. I've started to pay more attention to 'nouns', 'adjectives', 'adverbs' and the structure of every sentence now. I'm still making mistakes but it's not as bad as before. I like the awards system and the calendar of how often I write very much. Those awards keep me going and encourage me to do more practice. To be able to see my writing level going up or down immediately is also making me want to do better and better each time. I'm really impressed with the instant feedback too. I'm not a patient person, so to be able to see the constant feedback is remarkable. There is one thing that I don't like though. There aren't as many workbooks for beginner level as there should be. There should be triple of what they have at the moment. I would recommend this website to people I like, because I think this website can help them with their English writing.

Television entertains, but it can also educate us in several ways. Television has various programs for learning to offer, which are focussed on all age groups. For instance, adults watch television for the news, and they watch movies as well as series. On the other hand, television has a wide range of entertainment and education programs for children and young people, such as cartoon movies, wildlife shows, and science programs, which I think are really mind - blowing for children at their age of intellectual development. Television is one of the major media which is used frequently by most of the people around the world. However, recently, it has become associated with spreading misleading information and become full of propaganda, i. e. the information and stories reported in the media contain some sort of bias, and is twisted in the interest of news providers, organisations, or foundations. I believe that is what makes that television isn't always a reliable source of knowledge. Nevertheless, television is a major form of entertainment for children around the world, and it is considered the second source of learning after school and books.

Well it is really a great theme for discussion, it is very interesting to think about, and of course we have many ways to look at that. I know many people that agree with the idea that having the same teacher for years is better for their learning. On the other hand, I also know many people who believe that they need to change their teachers every certain period of time: six months or once a year. I have had many teachers since I started studying English and on this journey I have had good and bad teachers. So for me actually I think it does not matter too much if you change the teacher or not. But like I said before, I had good and bad teachers, and when you have a good teacher you feel happy and your level improves faster than when you have a bad teacher. The big problem with having bad teachers is that they can't help you to improve your English and it causes other problems because you feel exhausted and not interested in doing your extra class activities, so it is really bad. In my personal opinion, it is better to keep the same teacher if you can, because sometimes when you replace a teacher for another one you can get a worse teacher than the last one, and you find a need to change again, and maybe that other one could not be good either, and again you desire to try another one, and all this is not good for your learning.

Nowadays people are looking for online English courses. This is a new type of education and has some advantages and disadvantages that have to be taken into consideration before applying for an online course. One of the main advantages is that online education can reduce costs as courses don't need a classroom and all the facilities like computers and printed materials that usually schools have to provide to their students when they are attending a face-to-face course. For example, Write and Improve is an online platform that helps students with writing English activities through interactive exercises. Moreover, this online platform has digital resources like writing workbooks for each English level, and also virtual examinations depending on if you want IELTS or general training. Indeed, students can monitor their progress and recognize their strengths and weaknesses in real time in front of their computer wherever and whenever they wish. An additional factor to consider is that this online learning platform has some educational resources such as edition and writing that seek to improve our English level. On the other hand, some people could criticize that lack of human physical contact that is inherent in this online platform. Most important, being bilingual or multilingual is a social skill that humans develop in real situations, and only can improve these skills in real life. Write and Improve relies on online course materials but lacks the human interactions that languages have like body language for example. There are some language abilities that can only be acquired in real interactions that obviously a website is unable to replace. For example, pronunciation online programs are unable to teach about all the phonic varieties, accents and intonation. Despite these drawbacks, the future is online education, and this is linked with technological advances that obviously are going to tackle these situations, and probably are going to somehow replace face-to-face classes.

There is no doubt that volunteer work has a value for our life and that is why I agree with the statement. In my opinion, volunteer work is a valid requirement for students. Volunteer work is the first step to develop empathy and responsibility. In this essay I will explore the reasons. Firstly, volunteer work is a win-win situation. That means there is a mutual benefit for the students who develop soft skills, empathy and responsibility and for those who receive. Secondly, many students who start volunteer work at high schools bring the experience for the rest of their life. As an example of that, during my high school I did a volunteer work with orphans. This experience changed my life and even after I graduated I continued to visit them. Also, I helped with campaigns for donations which helped to buy food and many other things they need. Thus, volunteer work can be a change in our life and a mutual benefit.

I prefer having new teachers each year. Having new teachers each year can have many benefits for students. One of the benefits is to reduce the likelihood of the teacher having favourite students and making other students feel left out because of this bias. No matter how ethical a teacher might think he or she is, some teachers might fall into this trap without having realized they are having favourites. Each teacher has a different set of skills she or he uses to teach students. This means the students will be able to compare and perhaps learn what skills enhance their ability to study the most. Adapting to a new teacher every year will give students another proficient skill to adapt to changes outside of school. They can learn to get on with new people and manage to establish a relationship more easily when they have some sort of those skills beforehand. Getting to know a new teacher can be an exciting experience. It might stimulate the learning curve of students for the better. Students are young people, and at their age, they are always looking for something new and thrilling. They might want to go to school more because of this reason, thus, will not see school as boring as before. Therefore, I encourage all schools to have new teachers each year.

Nowadays, most students use a variety of devices to study and it seems that books will be disappearing in the future. In my opinion, while studying with technological equipment is useful, acquiring knowledge is more interesting when using books and paper. The main reason why I quite disagree with replacing the traditional way of studying with technology is that paper can make an amazing impression on us. For example, when I touch or smell books I feel peace and I am able to make a good connection with words. Last but not least, having technological devices is not affordable for most students. In addition, poor people can have access to libraries and study books for a lower price. Having said that, it is believed that it is easier to carry a huge range of books and articles on tablets than in the traditional way. Also, if we use tablets to read books, our environment remains safe because we do not have to cut enormous trees to produce paper. In conclusion, although studying with computers has some benefits, they are not able to replace books entirely because most people are not comfortable with it.

For millennia, parents have told their children to tell the truth, but is this true all the time? Nowadays, there are more and more lies being told every day, some good and some bad. It is up to us to determine whether a lie can or cannot be accepted, but there are still disputes about the boundaries between "right lies" and "wrong lies." Most people believe that all lies belong to one of 3 types. One reason people deceive is to minimize a mistake they have made. While it is true that everybody cannot avoid making mistakes once in a while, some do not have the courage to admit their errors for fear that they will be blamed or judged. For example, students might lie to their teacher about unfinished homework, they might say that they left the work at home when, in fact they did not do the work at all. The students did this because they wanted to save face. This kind of lie is wrong, you should admit your faults and not make the same mistake again, this is one of the 2 types of "wrong lies." Another reason people tell lies is to get out of situations that they do not want to be in. For instance, if a company decides to have a weekend meeting, one of the managers might not feel like attending. She may call her boss and give this excuse: "I have been fighting off a cold all week, and I cannot risk getting the others sick. I'll be sure to get all of the notes on Monday." When an individual does not want to admit something and face the consequences, they lie to avoid difficulties. This kind of lie is not right, but it is acceptable in some circumstances. It is difficult for people to face difficulties, but they must, so you must avoid this type of lie and face the challenges that lie ahead. Then there are "white lies" that are told when people do not want to hurt other people's feelings. If a good friend, for example, shows up with an unflattering new haircut, one could be truthful and say, "That haircut looks awful, what were you thinking?" A more gentle response would be to say, "It's very original, it suits you." These types of lies are only told when you do not want to hurt someone else's feelings, and are generally not considered negative or wrong. To sum up, there are 3 big kinds of lies: lies to minimize a mistake, lies to get out of situations that you do not want to be in, and white lies. While the former two types are considered negative, the latter is acceptable. In the future, I hope no one will tell lies, whether good or bad.

Travelling is one of the most desired leisure activities for people. It is an industry with a high impact on economic development and the planet. So, how is it going to change in the future? First at all, I think we will continue to travel as we do today, but maybe we will demand new clean ways to do the transportation. I believe the industry will be the same in the sense that people will want to travel and discover new places and cultures. The main difference could be the way of doing it, focusing on clean mobility. I would like to mention that nobody knows how the future is going to be, but if we take a look around us, we can imagine a more sustainable way of doing it. To conclude, I think we can expect new places to visit. The moon or space will be in great demand with the rich.

To be a volunteer is a good thing. However, if the volunteer is "required," it may not be good. The goal of volunteers is to "help." Whether helping humans, animals or the environment, people do it from the bottom of their hearts, which makes them feel great. Besides, helping others can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. In contrast, someone who is asked to be a volunteer, not aiding others through their own will, may not make an all-out effort. These volunteers just want to reach their goals as quickly as possible; therefore, they won't leave no stone unturned. The high schools which demand voluntary work from their students are well-meaning, but that could distort the intent of being a volunteer. The high schools should find some attractive ways, and guide students in the right directions. Only doing things from the bottom of their heart could they acquire the treasure of being a volunteer.

I like animals a lot. I have a pet, a small and nervous dog. I caught him because he didn't have any person who was looking after him. It has been one of the best moment in my life. Animals must live in freedom. In my opinion, wild animals would live better in their own environment. I don't like going to a zoo. I have seen their eyes and I think they aren't happy in this place. People look after them as well as possible and I'm sure that people have tried that animals live in a zoo as if they were in their own habitat, but it isn't the same. All animals are on earth to do something and this question is impossible if they are in a prison. We are changing our environment, cutting trees, creating pollution, burning forests, using a lot of water, and snatching animals from their places and showing them in a zoo. In conclusion, I would like to see all animals in freedom.

There is no shortage of opinion about whether or not schools should require students to study music and learn to play a musical instrument. In my opinion, students should not study music if they do not want to. People have different talents and schools should provide a range of options, including music classes, yet not that only. In this essay, I will explore the reasons. Firstly, studying music and learning to play a musical instrument is good to help to develop skills, such as discipline. However, many students are not familiar with playing instruments and it should be considered once it can destimulate instead of stimulate their talents. Secondly, I believe some people are born with a talent for music. As an example, my brother learned to play guitar by himself. He developed this talent since he was a little boy and nowadays he is a professional guitar player. One day I decided that I wanted to learn to play guitar. I did not have success, I was not able to even hold the guitar the right way. That experience made me feel sad and I felt I failed to learn. Since then, I decided I would not try to play any instrument. Thirdly, schools can afford different types of classes, such as music, art or cookery to stimulate creativity in students. Giving students many options helps them to choose which one they prefer and which one will be helpful for their career. In conclusion, although music classes develop discipline, I support the opinion that music classes should not be a requirement. As I noted above, schools should provide a range of options.

An education process is the result of interaction between students and a teacher. Then, the quality of this contact and how long this is happening is important for its success. In any situation for better following the progress of a student, the teacher can do tasks and exercises. This way, where there isn't a break, is interesting for specific situations, like when students have learning problems. But, for normal situations the contact with different teachers in the learning process is interesting to prepare the students for real-life situations, like working with different people, adapting to explain subjects in other contexts and other ways. In each learning situation, there are different requirements to know what is happening. The class is a space for contact between people that have different requirements, then learning can happen in mediation in different ways with the same long-term teacher or another.

First of all, I think it is a fantastic experience with so many advantages and some "disadvantages," which I prefer to classify as 'learning'. By way of introduction, studying abroad is highly recommended in the majority of schools and universities because of the opportunity that a student can have in order to improve another language. Apart from that, there are so many skills that one student can develop or improve during an exchange, such as communicative and social skills. Due to the student meeting new people from a different country and from a different culture, he has to find ways to interact and make friends. In addition, another advantage is that the student would learn to work with multidisciplinary teams, a great skill which would be really significant for his or her resume in the long term for internships or work. Moreover, an incredible advantage of having an exchange is to visit different touristic places, such as beaches, deserts, mountains, museums, lakes, and archaeological sites. Besides, the student can try new and diverse dishes which are traditional or very popular in the country of his new residence. On the other hand, the student will have the challenge to develop the ability to adapt to change, owing to the fact that the student is going to live far from home in a new city, as well as far from friends and family. She has to face the changes in her routines and start to visualize and plan the new activities according to her circumstances. In spite of all the opportunities and advantages, there are also some disadvantages from having an exchange. One instance could be that it can take much more time to finish a degree, due to the university just allowing the students a certain number of subjects, which is not bad at all because universities do this in order to make their exchange more enjoyable and with a little bit of less stress. However, I think that one disadvantage when a student starts studying abroad is the fact that the new university has different rules and processes to assess the students, which at the same time represents a challenge to develop strategies in order to get the most favorable results. Nevertheless, another disadvantage of studying abroad is that it is an expensive experience that requires a lot of money and unless a student wins a scholarship to make the exchange, which just covers part of the expenses, she will have to pay the flight tickets, the housing, the food, costs of travelling, and the payments to the university. Finally, speaking personally I would strongly recommend all students to make an exchange with wherever they want and not only learn and enjoy but also lose and find wonderful new places, change yourself, make new friends, and appreciate that unique experience of studying abroad.

In my opinion, health is way more important than wealth. There are absolutely no disadvantages to having excellent health. For example, if we are very rich but our health is not impressive then we will probably die soon and our wealth will be of no use. Could it save our health? It could not! On the other hand, if we have marvelous health but don't have that much money, we can still live a long life. If we are not healthy, we cannot even enjoy our life properly, because it will be so short that we won't be able to store precious moments with our family and friends. We will then realise the real meaning of 'Health is wealth'. It will come to our mind that our wealth was of no use and couldn't even save us from death. Thus, it is proved that health should be on a higher pedestal than our wealth because wealth is of little use but health is very precious.

Everyone has been trying to reach their goals throughout their whole life; so have I. I have been learning English for three years. At the moment, I can speak English to some extent.

Video games are very popular nowadays, not just with children, but many adults also enjoy playing games on their video games console or on their computer. With the evolution of technology, the games have become more realistic and it makes this kind of distraction very interesting for people that like it. You will find some experts are saying that video games are very bad for children, because they can cause some damage to their brain, and besides that it could cause social problems too. For them, if children start playing games at a young age it can cause an addiction to playing games all the time and the children lose interest in doing other tasks, like studying or doing some physical sports. However, many other experts and parents agree that playing games can improve some abilities in children's lives. Some experts says that the games can help children to be more concentrated and calmer, and playing games can improve their ability to think faster, and it could help them to solve complex problems. Of course, it is a complex subject to discuss, I think it is necessary to do many studies to know if playing games is good or bad for children. In the meantime, I guess the best thing to do is to be careful with the time your kids are spending on playing games, and besides that we need to be very carefully with what kind of games we are letting our children play. Because some games are very violent and sometimes they contain sexual scenes or inappropriate language for kids.

The movie is about low-income people in Vietnamese society, they dream about getting rich by buying lottery. " RÒM" shows the opposite side of Vietnam, the life of the low-income people. Let's watch this movie John, I know you would love it.

Speaking personally, I think zoos are good places to learn about animals and there are other reasons which bring about a lot of benefits. First of all, in my opinion zoos allow us to learn about the characteristics of animals such as their diet, learn about endangered species, the places where they are from, behavior, and so on. Moreover, zoos make us feel conscious about how some of our actions have side-effects on animals and on their habitats. One instance could be industrial growth, which is generating pollution in rivers, oceans, and in the air. And if that wasn't enough, this also provokes soil erosion and acid rain affecting animals' habitats. Furthermore, another action which doesn't have good effects on animals, is the creation of large amounts of trash, which reaches seas and oceans, and can kill marine species, such as turtles, sharks, penguins, and whales, among others, when they eat plastic. On top of that, we are facing many cases in Africa and Asia of clandestine hunting, which consists of hunters just chasing and killing animals, in order to obtain their tusks in the case of elephants or their fur in the case of bears, seals, and sea lions. So, zoos not only represent a home for many of these animals but zoos also save them from clandestine hunting. Apart from that, zoos can offer security to the animals and save animals from extinction. Additionally, zoos are those places where some animals can receive care and food when they are at risk or their habitats are not in great conditions, which has saved the lives of several animals. Also, zoos try to provide similar habitats to animals in order to make them feel at home and them not losing some instincts, which they need once they can go to a poaching-free habitat. Nonetheless, it is just necessary to take into account the treatment and care that animals have to receive in zoos, such as food in good conditions, veterinary care, spaces with the necessary conditions, and so on. As a conclusion, I think zoos are good places. They can provide a lot of benefits to animals and teach us a lot of valuable things about them.

In the history of human life, we see volunteer work. In human history, especially in this critical situation, people help together but it is not legal, therefore, it is necessary to teach volunteer work from school or high school. Volunteer work is very important in everybody's life because society needs volunteer work. For example, when a disaster happens, that area or that country needs help, so one of the most important ways is through volunteer work. In human history we see, for example, when an earthquake occurs in a corner of world, volunteer groups that are well organized in different organizations. They rush to the scene to help the injured people without any expectations. Therefore, everybody in their life, especially in high school, should practice and be trained to do volunteer work. In this essay, this article highlights the needs for volunteers to work as volunteers, therefore high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate.

Hello teacher, I am so excited to start a new year of studies, and I am further excited to talk about the subjects I want to improve at school. Last year I did a lot of interesting activities and I've learned a lot, especially about math and grammar. If I could I would like to learn more about science. NA,. for this new year I will be really happy to improve that ability. When the year had started I was really terrible at math and grammar, but during the year's classes I could see my improvement day by day. My comprehension of each subject taught by the teacher was becoming more clearly. Grammar for example, I was so bad in that subject I couldn't understand anything, and now I understand a lot of it. Although I have had a great improvement in some areas, I really need to improve some others. Science is still a challenge for me. So this year that subject will be my goal. I will become good at that. I already started doing some things, I am reading books and articles about science and next week I am going to a science fair.

More and more people in Japan study English, not only at their school but also on a personal basis. This is because it plays a more important role in a globalized international community. I, however, have learned it because I need it to pass the admission exam for the University of Tokyo. In the exam, about one-fourth of the mark is allotted to its English section. I must score more than 66% on the exam. To attain this goal, I have to get 90 points in the English section to which 120 points are allocated. I'm poor at writing so I have practiced it on this website. In the exam, I must write a short essay like on this website. Therefore, it helps me to prepare for the exam. But, what I think is a downside here is that the essay I must write here is a bit longer than in the exam.

It is really wonderful to see animals in the forest living their lives freely, but it is not so common anymore. The natural environment has become smaller, and the natural habitat for wild animals almost doesn't exist anymore. An alternative that humans have found to make people keep some contact with wild animals is to create a fake environment and put some species of animals there. It is not a perfect place for the animals, but it is a place where they can have food and medical care. To keep these places working normally visitors have to pay for a visit and this money is used to manage the zoo. Is it the best way to keep animals? Of course not, and I think everyone agrees with this, but on the other hand, sometimes it is the only way to keep some species alive because their environment no longer exist. It is so sad to see animals in a cage, as if they are guilty of something, but they're not! They just don't have any other space to live. I know many people like going to zoos, take pictures, and have fun with different species of animals. For me it is not fun, I would see them in a natural environment if I could. To be honest, I think it is very wrong to keep wild animals in a zoo, but I know that there are many zoos that keep sick animals that won't survive alone. In this case, I think it is great because those animals would die and have a chance to live, although it isn't a perfect life. I know that we, humans need to think what we could do to create some better conditions of life for the animals.

First of all, lies are, in general, not a bad thing. It is how, most of all, people use them these days. They lie to avoid uncomfortable situations and make things even worse with that. Lying is never the solution to a serious problem. It might delay the consequences, but in exchange they are, most of the time, a lot more severe. If all human beings communicated honestly and tried their best to avoid lies or misunderstandings, it would be so much easier for everybody. You could tell exactly what the counterpart wants from you. I mean in some moments it is easier to lie than tell the truth, just because you do not want to hurt someone else's feelings, but in the end they will know what the truth is and then it will hurt even more. There are some exceptions, for example when your children ask you something you cannot answer properly. So they will understand, you come up with a good lie. A prime example is Santa Claus or everything similar to that, you do not want to ruin your child's dreams or their childhood by telling them all those fairytales are not real, it would crush them. So in conclusion, lying is most of the time just postponing the drama, so only lie to your children or grandchildren and only if necessary.

Many countries sponsor their students to go abroad during high school or university and other countries have programmes for professionals to do their postgraduate or master degree abroad as well. It is very interesting because these people can learn not only new subjects but they can learn about new cultures and can expand their horizons. Some people disagree that these countries sponsor students to go abroad to study, because they believe that the money that the government spends on these students could be used in collective actions to help more people. Because for them, all citizens pay taxes and this tax money should not be used for individual interests. That money needs to be used for the collective interest only. However, there are many people that agree that a government can sponsor students to study abroad. For them, it is interesting because these students will achieve good qualifications and they can contribute to the development of their native countries when they finish their studies and come back to their native countries. I think it is really interesting and important for the students, because they will achieve more than just formal qualifications, they will learn different ways to do things, different ways to think about the same problems, and a possibility to interact with another culture, which is really great for all people. I know that many countries sponsor their students to do it, but if the government does not provide it and you have the chance to go abroad by yourself to study it is perfect you do it, so your horizons will be open more than you can imagine after finishing your studies.

Talking about office design, I believe an open space is more efficient than an enclosed workstation. Those who believe in an enclosed workstation are the ones who like to work in a prison type space. To me, it feels like no freedom and limits your working area in a confined space. However, working in an open area enables people to talk freely and work freely. Such condition enables people to come closer and work together instead of distancing themselves in a cubicle space which limits the cooperation with each other. One good example is Google. Google has a free open environment for people to work anywhere they want. Today they may choose to work near a park. Then, the next day, they may choose to work near a playground. Such freedom enables workers to have a choice. Having a choice is where imagination comes from and gives value to the company. This is a valuable asset and could not be present in an enclosed workstation.

In a world that promotes mainly comfort and a sedentary life, sport can be considered a loophole. Introducing more sports classes can be regarded as a solution for this problem but I do not consider that forcing students into taking them is a wise decision. First of all, the most beneficial part of doing sport is improving health quality. In most cases children tend to spend time only on computers and this can lead to scoliosis, obesity and other health issues. Secondly, playing sports can have other benefits, like learning to be part of a team. It is generally thought that being a team player is an advantage for job applications. A good illustration of this is the structure of an interview when, almost always, the employer asks you how well can you collaborate with other colleagues. Furthermore, the current generation, known as the ”Y” generation or ”snowflakes”, is at great susceptibility for mental health diseases. That being said, playing sports can help children be happier. Evidence for this is provided by the secretion during physical activities of substances that makes you feel relaxed and peaceful, such as serotonin and dopamine. In addition, sport can take the form of a hobby, hence giving students the opportunity to have a leisure activity and take a break from all the studying. In spite of all the advantages that come from sport, I think that forcing children into doing it is wrong. There is a reason to believe that: coercing a child into doing something can be regarded as a bad technique. Thus, obliging students in taking more sport classes can have a negative outcome, for instance they will drop sports for good. Taking everything into consideration, even though physical activity has many pros, forcing that on students can result in the exact opposite.

If you have a lot of money, but you're not healthy, money doesn't have any value. However, if you're healthy, but you don't have money it doesn't make any difference because you're healthy and it's important to mention that money can't buy health. Some people are very attached to money, for them money is everything. If you have money you can have anything you want, perhaps they think that they can buy health, and be immortal. The reality is that you don't need a lot of money to live well and be healthy, the important thing here is you need to live your life well. What I mean is just living life responsibly, eating vegetables and fruits, doing exercise, and feeling good about yourself. If I have a lot of money, but I can't spend it because I'm in hospital due to an illness that isn't easy to get over, what do I need money for?

Given the fact that most medical doctors prefer to work in cities where they will make a lot of money instead of working in rural areas, an unbalanced situation is raised where people in rural areas receive poor medical care and people in urban areas receive good medical care. This unbalanced situation caused people to move towards cities and leave rural areas. One of the reasons behind this is there is not enough financial support from the Government and poor administration in rural areas. It causes doctors to lose their motivation to work in rural areas if they can receive more incentives in cities. To solve this situation, the Government plays an important role in minimizing the gap between cities and rural areas by trying to provide more incentives and giving support for doctors who work in rural areas. Such incentives could be present in the form of financial support.

For me, learning English is very important because knowing another language gives you opportunities, like getting a better job, meeting people, visiting other countries, and in particular allowing you to get relevant information about important topics. However, speaking in a professional context, knowing another language is very important for the better development of a professional. I'd like to be an engineer and if I want to work for an international company, I have to know another language because I'm going to be in contact with people from different countries. All of the information that I'm going to work with is going to be in English due to this language being very common around the world. Changing the context to another more personal one, I'm learning English because it's a personal challenge that I set myself since I noticed that if I learn another language I'll be able to know more things and I'll become a better professional.

Dear Betty, I am writing to tell you about the concert I went to last week. Firstly, when I heard that Green Day were going to have a concert in my city, I knew I had to go to it, because it has been my favourite band for many years. The concert was absolutely wonderful. I had the opportunity to see my idol, Billie Joe Armstrong, in flesh and bones. Plus, I had a seat in the first row. Can you believe it? He looked directly into my eyes. For me it was more than a concert, it was a real experience. It was amazing to turn on the phone lights and to sing along with the crowd their most underrated songs, such as "21 Guns" or "Holiday." I had so much fun and I hope that one day we will go together to one of their concerts. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Love, Bianca

In every country, there are many problems that have not been able to be solved. Not having enough doctors in rural areas is a common problem today. Most medical doctors want to work in cities where they can make a lot of money. Yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I think it is not only because of money but because of accommodation and food and they probably don't like the environment. In cities, everything is great, like the internet connection, food and so on. The rural areas are very poor in everything in comparison to cities. So, most of the doctors don't want to spend time in rural areas. Moreover, as I mentioned above, they can't make a great deal of money when they are in rural areas. For example, in developing countries, doctors tend to open clinics on the basis of their respective field. They make extra money from doing so. To solve this problem, the government should give the doctors an incentive to work in rural areas. For instance, giving a pay rise or giving elite privileges to the doctors who work in rural areas might help solve this problem, I think.

Human history shows music has been an integral part of our life. You see these things in ancient discoveries. Archaeologists have unearthed many musical instruments. This shows that music has always existed in human life. You never see music has not been part of human life. Of course some children were taught music by their parents or other people. Although this method was not systematic, in any case, it has helped the continuation of music in the history of human life. Students in school study many subjects, for example math, physics, history etc. So students in school need subjects to be relaxed, studying could help them, and another important reason is it is necessary to learn music from childhood. Thus, compulsory music education at school helps students, teachers and parents to realize the talent of students in the field of music. So I think all students should have to study music in school.

At present, we know that studies have shown the great benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Thus, exercise along with a few other healthy habits can reduce the risk of premature death. I completely agree that exercise is important for our health, but our diet, the quality of our sleep, and not smoking are important as well. Firstly, researchers calculated life expectancy according to how many of these healthy habits people had. As a result, according to this analysis, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. Secondly, we can take better care of our health as long as we don't ignore the aspects that are in our control, such as making exercise a regular habit, getting enough sleep, eating a well-balanced diet or quitting smoking. In addition, looking after our emotional well-being is just as important as caring for physical health. By nurturing wellness, we are better able to handle life's challenges. Moreover, switching to a healthy lifestyle doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time.

Dear Jughead, I am writing to you to let you know how wonderful I find 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone'. I have seen it hundreds of times, but it never gets boring. I enjoy it every time, as if it were the first time. I love this film. For me it is more than a film. It made my childhood beautiful and every time I watch it I go back to when I was a little kid and all I was doing was waiting for my letter from Hogwarts. Even though I am a grown-up now, I am still dreaming about being a wizard. In other words, it has changed not only my childhood but my whole life. I strongly believe that you will enjoy it, because there are characters that you can relate to, such as Ron Weasley, who is a foodie like you, or Hermione Granger, who is fond of reading and is the smartest student in school like you used to be when you were younger. I hope I convinced you to try it. Write to me after watching it and tell me how you liked it. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Love, Bianca

Hi Masccot, It's great to hear from you. I hope you are very well. The purpose of this letter is as follows. Last night, I watched a horror film called "It, the diabolic clown." It is a scary movie, with dramatic scenes. I jumped out of my seat and my heart was racing with this movie. I'm afraid of the next chapter. I love these films, because the plot is actually awesome and you can predict the ending. Also, I think the actors and directors normally do a very good job! I believe this film can help you to improve you story about "The clowns in the city." So, you should watch it! I hope you write back soon. Best regards, Sylvia

In terms of learning English, why we should learn English, and what the target is of doing that, I will illustrate three important points of learning English. Firstly, if you a good launguage you can study abroad, also you will be a privileged candidate for getting job opportunities. Secondly, you can communicate with foreign people around the world and protect yourself from scams as well as enhance your ability to learn another language and make your life easier.

Is there anyone who likes the rainy season out there? Because I want to share my feelings about the rainy season in this article. It is the season I like the most . Maybe it is because I was born in that season. Nothing can make me happier than seeing rain while having a cup of coffee inside the house. It is so amazing that I could forget everything at that moment. You can't deny that the rainy season is very helpful for agriculture . The luxuriant vegetation is likely to grow with the help of rain. The verdant surroundings make everyone feel peaceful when they take a look at it. In the rainy season, the schools are opened. Children are happy as they get to meet their friends again. One can see that wells, rivers, and streams are filled with water. You can also hear the cry of the frogs. The rainy season is the most beautiful season for me. On the other hand, some areas are flooded because of the heavy rain. There may be some difficulties for transportation. But I still love the rainy season as I feel warmth when it is raining. You may think it is ridiculous. The sound of the rain can heal my soul. I like wearing the clothes which are particularly designed for the rainy season. I also love the feeling of walking in the rain wearing a rain coat. Therefore, the rainy season is special for me . And nothing can change my love for the rain.

First of all, I think that exercise is not only important for our physical health but also contributes to having a better quality of life, due to the fact that when we work out we have more energy for our daily activities, we feel more relaxed, and we can reduce our stress levels. However, there are other things that we can consider as important as exercise. There are even others that we consider more important. One instance of this could be learning a new language, which could represent an opportunity to develop a new skill, have more knowledge, and be able to communicate with other people in our work and personal life. On top of that we often consider it imperative to learn a new language in order to visit other countries, meet new people, and get to know other cultures and traditions. Besides, it means an opportunity to enjoy a wonderful trip, which is one of my personal goals. Apart from that, I think my studies are really important for me as a student and sometimes I dedicate more time to studying for tests than doing exercise, owing to the fact that what we learn during our years at university will be essential to have a successful future career. In addition, I would say that dedicating time to our family is also more important than exercise. So in order to drive this home, I think not only are our families our foundation and our support when we are feeling down, but they are also those who we can share our achievements and happiness with. Finally, I would say that indeed there are other things that have more priority over exercise, but that doesn't mean that we are careless when working out, it just means that we will often make decisions about what to do with our time and our lives according to our priorities and what we want to achieve in the long term.

One day, the biggest gang of the city sends a message: they want to get together with the other gangs at midnight in Central Park. Nine members of The Warriors come to this meet. Suddenly, the leader of the big gang is murdered. In the confusion, the killer blames the warriors, then, all the gangs begin to chase the warriors through the city. It's an amazing movie that I really recommend.

It is a tricky question, because I think both can be done. If I had to choose, I would go for a short intense life. I can't see myself doing nothing during my life. What is the meaning of life when the only thing you do is live, and do nothing that you enjoy. I am a bold person, I am a daredevil, as a result I like taking risks, it is in my genes. I like rock climbing, running and I intend to do skydiving in the near future. Even I am mindful that these activities are risky, I am nothing like a coward who runs away when he encounters risk. Admittedly, I am more likely to die, but it is when I am close to death that I am so overwhelmed with my emotions that I feel the most alive. People who are not risktakers will never undertake projects or activities that would result in failure. These people need to get over it and to push themselves beyond the line. I am not of this kind, I perceived my dreams and projects whether they are risky, bold, mindless or not, as long as I will relish the process to get it. I think a shorter life is more meaningful than a long and dull life. I do not want to keep slumping on my sofa while looking at the world going forward through my window.

Today, I choose the topic of an opinion essay on 'Health or Wealth'. In my opinion, everybody says that health is more important than wealth, of course. But the reality is different. There is a compulsory health insurance in Europe. When we are children, the compulsory health insurance is paid for by the Czech Republic, when we are 18 years old we have to pay for ourselves. We have health care in each moment in the insurance system. If anyone has no job he has to give evidence of being unemployed. He gets his medicine each month and the compulsory payments are made by the Czech Republic. The second situation is in the USA. It is the opposite situation. The healthcare is not for everybody. I can pay for health insurance, but I do not have to pay for it. If I am ill and I have to go to the doctor I have to pay for all injections and pills.

The future of travel Nowadays, we are facing a new era in which the corona virus has brought changes to our ways of doing things and one of them is the way we travel. As a result, I think travel will be different in the future, starting with the reduction of the number of people that are going to be allowed to go to some places, such as museums, stadiums, and parks. Besides, it will be likely that people prefer to go to nearby places rather than faraway countries in the short term, so as to protect themselves from the virus. Moreover, the way hotels and hostels clean their rooms is going to be different in the future, because they will have to do a perfect cleaning with special equipment so as to disinfect every room, every time a visitor checks out and another checks in, in order to ensure the travellers the best possible stay. On top of that, I believe that technology and artificial intelligence are going to play an important role in the way we travel. One instance of this could be that now, thanks to them, there are going to be simulations on offer of different trips to different countries in which people will be able to experience a trip. Hence they will have the opportunity to take a better decision of which places to visit. Apart from that, I think the way we move and travel is going to change in the future, in view of the fact that technology has advanced a lot. I think there will be other kinds of airplanes and cars, which are also going to be cheaper and more accessible. On the other hand, I think there are many ways of travelling which will still be the same in the future, such as the routes of travel. These routes wouldn't change because they have been determined taking into account the preservation of touristic places. In addition, I think travelers will continue to make reservations in hotels and hostels the way they have done, so as to save money and time once they arrive in another country. Also, restaurants and cafes will still be attending the travellers in the same way at every tourist point, owing to the fact that people would still prefer to eat out rather than stay at home and cook. Finally, travel is going to be the same in the aspect of formalities. That is to say the hosts in all countries are going to still ask for passports and valid visas with the purpose of having a control over the number of people who enter and leave the country.

Oh! It is good to talk about holidays, although I did not have many holidays in my life. I would say that the holidays I had were great. It is to write about the most important holiday I ever had in my life; that is it, right? I think the most important for me was when I went on a honeymoon holiday, which was great because I went with my wife and we were just starting our life together and it was so fantastic I had that time with her. We went to a beach located in the north of the state of Sao Paulo. We had already got married and for us it was all new. It was a new time together and sharing our life with another person. It was the first time we went on holiday alone. Yes, because it wasn't our first holiday together. When we were dating we had been on a holiday, but on that occasion we went with other people, her mother and father, her daughter, and my son. This definitely was not a romantic holiday. I can't say it was a terrible holiday because it wasn't, it was good, My father-in-law is a very good person.

There are those who prefer to live their own while they are attending school, and there are those who choose to live with their parents while they are students. The difference depends on the choice from a personal decision. It is up to their consideration, ranging from their financial situation to personal matters. To me , I think moving away and living on their own is a better choice, if students are able to choose whether to stay with family or living on their own. The reason is simple. It is time for them to take care themselves. As a student, besides pursing the academic road, learning and adapting to a new environment is another aspect that students have to learn themselves. It is a place where students acquire social and living skills in a school environment. It is better to acquire it at an early stage instead of at an adult stage where they face even harsher challenges.

Nowadays most of the medical doctors want to work in cities to make a lot of money and find all that they need like shops and markets or even government interests. This problem isn't easy to be solved but the government should solve it quickly because of adults and children who are sick and can't work due to illness. This problem needs many changes to be solved. It's easy to find the solution but it's difficult to make it work. One of them is building good hospitals for doctors to work in. That is very important because it makes the doctor feel as if he is working in the city. It also will be more accurate and easy to treat patients. Second, we should build compounds where doctors live. The most important thing in the compound or the place where the doctors live is that it should contain the main services like water, light, internet or even stores of food. Last but not least are the government interests and the police. They are very important because no one will leave a safe city and go to an unsafe place. We should build offices for police and the government interests. All in all, there should be doctors in rural areas and they need to find all that they need.

In the history of human life, we see, in rich classes, parents send children to boarding school, but most of them stay at home, because they have not enough money to send their children to boarding school. But the reason why parents send children to board is because they want their children learn how to live independently. Students who go to university to continue their education, move away from their families, and live independently, have advantages and disadvantages. The most important results are: they learn how to deal with problems and solve them alone, they face problems that they have not encountered before and are forced to a find a solution to them, and this is very useful for their future. Of course, all students could not live on their own. Another important case is they learn how to deal with other people. In conclusion, life for students on their own is important for future life, they learn how to deal with problems and deal with other people. Therefore, I suggest every student could live on their own.

What is the best office to work in? From parents, friends, films, books or other sources I know about two general types of offices. The first one is when everyone is sitting in the same room and can communicate without e-mails or phones, but just by shouting or going to their neighbour. Such offices are useful for workers who have a group project because they can exchange permanetly permanently about the level of the project. But in my opinion the second design for offices is better. Here only one or two workers are sitting in the same room. In this case they can create their rooms like they want in order to have a suitable atmosphere. Another positive point about working alone is that you are not distracted by other people. I knew from school that working with a lot of people simultaneously is very difficult, because people speak about every topic except the task to be done. In summary, I think that working in the same building, so you can spend your luncheon with colleagues, is good, but sharing a big office with 10 people is not efficient for your work.

Nowadays a lot of young adults, teenagers and school children are struggling with obesity symptoms. This is because most of them are sitting inside for the whole day and do not enough sports. Because of this, it can be questioned if it is appropriate to force all mentioned young people to do exercise activities at least three times a week. The first advantage of forcing students to do sports three times a week, is to make sure that they are not in front of their laptops or tablets. Teenagers do not move enough when they are in front of their screens for the whole day. Furthermore, students will get concentration problems when they are not taking enough time to relax. Besides this, the motor development of those children will not be as good as when they do sports a few times a week. The second advantage is, that children will improve their unhealthy lifestyle. A common fact is that teenagers eat too much fast food. A consequence for this situation is that a lot of young people have been diagnosed with obesity or diabetes. Doing more sports could be a solution to improve their lifestyles. A disadvantage of forcing students is that not all people have the ability to pay contribution, because they do not earn enough money or can not go for sports that are further away because their parents do not have a car. For those poor families, the government has to pay for the sport lessons of these students if the state wants to force them to go. In summary, it is a good idea to force students to exercise more often so that young people can improve their lifestyles and can relax in the fresh air. A solution for poor families is a gift from the government so that their children are also able to improve their physical and mental wellbeing.

We, humans have to work for a living. We need food to be alive and we need shelter to live comfortably. Consequently, we need money to some extent. However, money can't solve any problem; it can't buy us happiness. In order to live peacefully, health plays a vital role in our daily life. It seems to me that health is more important than wealth. Do you ever ask yourself if you live to work or work to live? For me, I work to live. Being healthy is a blessing: you can do anything you want and go anywhere you want. In other words, you can't do whatever you would like to if you are not in good health. For example, supposing you are ill, you will not be able to go to school or work. You would have to stay at home until you are well. Besides, your mother would go out of her way and make time to take care of you. There would be nothing good enough for you. That's why you have to stay healthy physically and mentally. It is essential to not forget that you are enough. We don't need to try to be wealthy like others. I am not saying that being wealthy is not good at all. As I mentioned above, we need money to live properly. I mean that we should not work desperately without taking good care of our health, which leads to disorder. In fact, we will not be able to make money if we are unhealthy. To sum up, I strongly believe the idea that " healthy is wealthy " . For the reasons I mentioned above, I personally believe that health is definitely more important than wealth.

In my opinion, it is better that we have new teachers each year. With new teachers we can have new experiences. Of course, it depends on the behaviour of each teacher. Each student is different from other students. A good teacher is someone who can understand her / his students and have a good relationship with them. For each age we need a special teacher . All teachers must learn about the behaviour and skills of students. As an example, imagine a child student and a poor student. There are a lot of differences between them . Another reason that I do not agree with having the same teacher is I think if we change our teacher we will have good results. If a teacher has some problems with her /his students and we do not change her /his students in the next year, I think we will transfer the problems . We will not be able to change them.

For example, we learned about what kind of maintenance there is: 1) preventive maintenance, which is compulsory and advisable. It is important and necessary to avoid mechanical problems. 2) corrective maintenance, which is substantial when the car has a small or a big difficulty or a defective part.

There are a variety of activities which high school students are required to complete before entering either a university or working life. One of them is volunteer work. In my opinion this type of work is genuinely suitable for high school students. There are a lot of reasons for joining volunteer work. For instance, they can learn how to deal with difficult situations once they enter the real working world and they can find their own passion through their volunteer work. Volunteer work is the right way for high school students to practise their skills outside the classroom. They are able to witness the work system in each job, moreover they can learn how to handle and be prepared for any difficulty which they will encounter later once they have a full-time job. Another good reason for being a part of volunteer work is students are able to search for a job that suits their abilities and personalities. They will find out from volunteer work whether they would like to pursue that career or completely change to different career paths. In conclusion, high school students should be introduced to volunteer work, so they will be able to cope with any obstacles that will be thrown at them. And also they will be able to search and select the right job for their future.

People have been discussing a lot of ways to keep their bodies and mind healthy. We know that exercise is very important to keep our body fit, but is it important to maintain our mind healthy too? Are there other activities that can help us to be healthy? For me, exercise is one of the best ways to be healthy. Exercise joined with a good diet can make the good balance that we need to be healthy. When I was younger, I suffered a lot from knee pain, and I had used many types off medicine to cure it, but nothing worked properly. So one day I decided to do something different to see how it was gonna work, so I started doing exercise. In the first days, I felt so bad, my whole body hurt and many times I thought that I wouldn't continue doing that. Some days passed, my body started to become better, so I thought, yes it is working. It was making my body feel less pain and I could start to live my life as well as any other person that has no pain at all.

For three weeks, I have been using the Write and Improve program for my English writing. And I can see my progress very clearly. Before I found this free program for English writing, I was concerned that even if I tried to write an English article, nobody would correct it and give me feedback. Furthermore, it is also very tedious to find exciting topics every day for writing. The Write and Improve program has solved all these problems. Since then, I have been very motivated to practise my English. Of course, this program is also not perfect. E. g., the main drawback in my viewpoint is that the program cannot find all errors, and you still need to do the additional grammar check with other programs. But since it is for free and has many more useful functions, I will give it excellent feedback and recommend it to others.

I don't use a computer often because my computer is very slow and also I have my ipad where I can do a lot of things like on a computer but it isn't the same. When I used a computer about 4 months earlier I used it for practising my coding skills and for looking for some interesting things to improve my skills, especially coding skills. When I was younger, my favourite thing that I did with my computer was playing games, I think like other people. In the last few years, I often used my computer for work.

One of the nicest activities in my house is making makeup. It really is a fun time and I can utilize the time away from my phone, as well as enjoy the happiness of the kids. In fact, it is a long time since I did it, maybe half a year, because I'm too busy at university. Activities are very healthy for the body, and they always make you happy and also endure difficult situations. Just smile every time. Another example is you can help people, or cook for students. Ultimately, people should do what makes them happy. Thank you.

I've lived in Mogi das Cruzes. In my home town the houses are different in relation to the USA or London. They're closer together and our house has walls like a castle. The idea is to protect me and my family from thieves. In the center of the city, there is a shopping mall. It has a cinema and different restaurants. Recently, the government has opened a park. It is nice because you can do a barbecue. If I talk about entertainment, in my city, there isn't so much, at least in my opinion. We have only the cinema, I miss an amusement park and a museum. When I feel like going to an amusement park or a museum, I need to go to another place, another city. This is very exhausting.

Everyone has his own opinion. We also put in our thoughts that it's back to the teacher if he is good or bad. But I think it is better to have the same teacher because, you take a lot of time to feel comfortable with your teacher and that's back to You will have chemistry with your old teacher and this will be good and will not make you shy to ask him for something. And he will be helpful to you because you are already his friend and you have spent a lot of time together. So that's what I mean with a good and respectful relationship with him. In the other case, if you have a bad teacher it will be suck for you to do anything with him, even just talk. It will be a black year or longer for you because you had a bad memory with him, however you have to respect you teacher even if he's bad.

In my personal experience, video games are very important in childhood because video games help my brain to use my imagination properly . Plus, I don't play all the time , I only play one hour a day.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to keep any animals in zoos because zoos can save many animals for many reasons. The first reason is many zoos are places for endangered animals which can live without being hunted by hunters in their natural habitats. The second reason is to breed some animals that are almost extinct and reintroduce them into their habitats. This program can improve animal genetics in nature and reduce cross-breeding in animal herds. Moreover, some animals have a problem with mating, for example, clouded leopard males are very aggressive when they are in estrous period and they can kill their mates while they are mating. It is no use if clouded leopard females die from mating. Scientists and veterinarians have found a way to increase the animal population by using the artificial insemination technique. As for the last reason, zoos are shelters for the animals which came from wildlife trafficking. We can't let them free because they have been brought from the forest when they were young and their instinctive behavior has changed. On the other hand, zoos should provide an environment in the animals' cages that is like their natural habitats and strengthen their behavior by supporting enrichment in the cages in the cages in order to avoid stereotypical behavior.

My favorite indoor activity is yoga, which I started doing when lockdown started in Barcelona. I like this activity because it is relaxing and promotes wellness, which gives me some work & life balance, apart from that, I can speak with some people at the gym where we practise this activity.

Do you like travelling? Have you ever wondered how travel will be in the future? Or maybe you even enjoy dreaming about a unique spaceflight? Follow me, I'm going to explore these ideas more fully! On the one hand, a journey of discovery brings a lot of joy and maybe for this reason we are powerful explorers. As a result, the tourism revolution seems to be closer than ever and space tourism could very soon become our reality. The passengers will board astonishing vehicles which will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in spacecraft and travel beyond Earth, you might enjoy the classical holidays. In my opinion, the well-known means of transport will be used as usual and tourists will travel all around the world for sightseeing and they will discover the wonders of our amazing planet. Trains, plains, or boats will be utilised by many people in order to reach their travel destinations. Each year the world sees different travel trends that come and go as technology and other factors vary. Clearly, new ways of travel will need to be both safe and sustainable at the same time.

In my opinion, it is really amazing. As a student I'd like go to another country and study at another university. It has a lot of advantages. For example, you can see and visit people from other countries and learn about their culture. The second scale is that you have to learn their language. The third positive point and the most important thing is that you will be independent from your family. You will live in another country and you have to do your work alone. It is the best time to test your abilities. But everything has negative things. You may become sad and depressed. You miss your family and sometimes cry over them. All of these things depend on your personality. If you are a strong human you will be successful, but if you have a dependent character you will not be happy. I want to tell you to do your best .

The school of the future will not be very different from today's. We need to be in touch with other people, and in the case of children it is extremely necessary. Adults have a different way of learning. Studying through a computer is an easier way to learn without going out and facing traffic or even having to go to another city. On the other hand, computers are going to play an important role in the education of children. For example, in case of a disease or a surgery where a child has to be at home, a teacher can explain all the subject through a computer and perhaps the student can participate in the class in a virtual way. To sum up, computers will change all the things that we know about schools. A large number of people will be able to study any course at home. Although it is revolutionary, schools will be the same because social interaction is very important for a child.

My personal opinion is that I don't support this method of keeping animals because it prevents their freedom, plus they don't behave naturally. The animals can't be active because they sit or sleep all the time and that is not healthy for them. Also animals naturally depend on activities. animals and people both start suffering either from psychological or physical ailments. For instance, any person not moving their body or not doing physical activities or exercise becomes obese and depressed like the animals. Zoos are like a prison because they don't let animals practise their animal instinct, plus they become savage and aggressive. They cannot find a partner for themselves. Also , they cannot hunt prey on their own. We must respect animals and follow the steps of Islam to preserve the habitats of animals and preserve the different species for them Thanks for reading.

It was last summer. We had two weeks for our holidays. My husband and I agreed to go to the north of Iran . It has sea and forest . We rented a house next to a sea and a forest . The house was amazing. It had 2 bedrooms and a big hall and it was furnished. The hall had two big windows, one of the windows was opening to the sea and from the other window you could see the forest. When we arrived there, the sun was going to set. We sat on the balcony and looked at the sun . It was wonderful. The sun went down and hid at the end of the sea. At night, the sea was a little wavy. We heard the sound of water. I like walking near the sea. We went out and I put away my slippers and walked on the sand. In the morning, we woke up with the beautiful song of birds.

Freedom is is a fundamental part of society. Most people believe that they can do anything they want unless it is wrong. This value, however, is at odds with recent trends. Nowadays, more and more schools are forcing students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week, regardless of the student's opinions. Should we honor freedom above all else and allow students to choose whether to do sports activities, or force them to do at least 3 sports activities per week? Forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week is better for three reasons. Participating in sports activities have been shown to enhance a student's academic performance. The University of Kansas saw that students-athletes had higher GPAs (Grade-Point Averages) and a 10% higher rate for graduating from high school than students who did not participate in sports activities. This is because doing sports have been shown to increase grey matter in your brain, so enhancing students' academic performance. This is one major reason why students should be forced to do at least 3 sports activities per week. Forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week would also teach the student more about time management. The student will need to learn how to manage his time to ensure that he makes it to practice and games while also completing his school work and studies. This shows that forcing students to do sports activities can help them be better at managing their time. This is another reason why schools should force students to participate in sports activities at least 3 time per week. Last but not least, compelling students to do sports activities at least three times a week improves students' ability to make decisions. In sports, things happen quickly and an athlete needs to react fast to be effective. This is an ability the student will build upon as he obtains more experience. This is the third reason why schools should force students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Opponents of schools forcing students to do sports activities see that freedom is key. So, students should have the freedom to choose whether to do sports. This point has some merit on the surface, but, enforcing this rule is for the student's own benefit. This rule helps students to improve themselves. In summary, schools should compel students to do at least 3 sports activities per week because participating in sports and enhancing students' academic performance, teaches students about time management, and improves students' ability to make decisions. I envision a future in which all schools requires students to do at least 3 sports activities per week, and the students eagerly cooperate.

With the development of globalization, the number of students studying abroad is increasing dramatically. Twenty years ago, there were only three main destination countries for most Chinese students to learn abroad: Japan, the UK, and the USA. Now Chinese students are everywhere. Besides the previous popular countries like Japan, the UK, and the USA, other European countries, such as Germany, France, and Italy are also becoming popular. There are advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. Firstly, the students who study abroad can experience a different culture and life and broaden their knowledge. Secondly, most students also want to improve their foreign language. For instance, most Chinese students don't speak English in their daily life. However, excellent English is a must in almost all work fields. Therefore, many students choose to study in the USA to improve their spoken English and better understand Western culture. Besides advantages, there are still some drawbacks that one cannot ignore. Firstly, the cost of studying abroad is relatively high. For example, especially in the USA, the students pay around 50.000 dollars per year. It is quite expensive for most of them. Secondly, many students who study abroad cannot adapt to the new environment; they don't have many friends there and always feel lonely. Thirdly, as far as I know, many Chinese students are much too shy and are not good at adapting themselves to the new culture and environment. Therefore, they only try to get in touch with other Chinese students and have very little chance to speak English or other foreign languages. As a result, many of them still cannot speak English fluently even after studying abroad. Studying abroad is an excellent chance to boost foreign language skills and experience a different lifestyle and culture. However, how much one will benefit from it varies from person to person.

Nowadays, I just try to enjoy activities with my family in my free time, such as going to the beach or golf course. I often go every Friday and Saturday. The main reason I like to go to the beach with my family is because we can do something different from our working week and we could speak, play and tell some jokes outside. Furthermore, we swim and sunbathe at the beach. Due to the lockdown and government restrictions, we haven't been able to go to the beach since last summer. Finally, I sometimes like being alone without my family, and I read some books and watch some movies or series from Netflix or HBO in English, because one of my activities is to study English to understand my colleagues and speak better.

It is argued that telling the truth is vital for every moment of life. While lying has some drawbacks, I quite agree that we need to use lies on some fundamental occasions. There are some benefits of hiding the truth in some ways. On the one hand, if people face a situation which is a matter of life and death for them, they must tell lies. Sometimes you must not reveal the truth if you think it could put you and people who you love at risk. For example, when somebody is threatened by a thief who wants to give important information, they have to ignore telling the truth to save their life. In addition, in any national circumstances, decision-makers have to give wrong data or lie to the public. This means when a country is facing foreign interference, like a war, politicians must prevent to tell the truth about their strategies and missions. For instance, in the war between Iran and Iraq in 1980, the Iranian commanders did not reveal any data about the weapons and their plans to the public or media to avoid any dangerous situations for soldiers. If any vital information had been disclosed to people showing the truth, the country would have failed in the attack. In conclusion, although telling a lie is unacceptable between some individuals, in my view, in some specific situations we must neglect the truth to save our life or national benefits.

Hello Tresa, What have you been doing lately? I miss you. We haven't seen each other for a month. I want to tell you about the concert I went to last week. As you know, I am the biggest fan of BTS. I've always wanted to attend their concert, but I never had a chance to go because their concert tickets are too expensive for a student like me to buy. As luck would have it, my grandfather gave me pocket money before they announced the concert date. With that pocket money, I bought the ticket. Some might think that it is unreasonable to spend such an amount of money on a concert ticket, but I've waited for so long to see them in reality. That is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. So, I decided to take it at all cost. I still can't believe that I saw them performing on the stage in reality. I have just always watched their performance on my phone screen. The real voices of them are really amazing. But the trouble was that I couldn't watch the performance till the end. Because I fainted during their performance since it was the very first time that I'd stood up for so long. I was very sorry about it. Next time, I will watch the performance till the very end. I think my letter is too long. So, let me stop my letter here. I hope to see you soon.

In my opinion an open office design is an advantage for both workers and employers according to the following reasons. First of all, because of the spacious design, workers are able to communicate freely with one another. The missing physical borders might also reduce the mental borders, preventing some employees from asking a superior for support or assistance. In my view these interactions add real value to the company and the product or service which is developed. So not only the workers themselves but also the firm might gain an advantage from this kind of office design. Moreover the office has always been a social place. This is again stressed by the outbreak of the corona virus right now, which shows that the social culture is a crucial part of a company's identity. This culture must be lived in everyday conversations and everyday acting which is difficult in environments where everyone is working in his own limited space.

Well, as a little girl, my family loved to travel, especially to countries with mild or hot weather as well as beautiful nature. As for me, I like transportation a lot, as I love all cities and the way they use transport. For example, Egypt uses taxis more. People in Saudi Arabia use private cars. In addition, in China they use all means of transportation, such as trains, cars, and airplanes. Most years there has been a development in the automotive industry. People of the future prefer fast travel. And due to climate change in the universe, the heat in the world is increasing more and more. So this is a big problem that we have to deal with as it becomes more complicated. However, we cannot travel. Cars are still the most used, it is true that they are not safe, but everyone loves to drive, in addition to the need to replace the bus instead of the car.

My personal experience last year was that I liked doing physical activities. I believe that this subject is important for students because the subject depends on activities such as stimulating the brain and maintaining a healthy body, and it helps a student focus on learning all the time. My fields of learning make me happy. Chemical reactions I don't talk about because my major is chemistry. No, I really liked these interaction things when I was in high school. My opinion is that there are some things in the school that must be changed, for example, providing requirements for certain chemicals for safe reactions. I am not in a hurry as far as achieving my goals is concerned, I think I should be walking step by step as I slowly learn. This is what I learned from scientists. Finally, I suggest the school principal lets me make a presentation on how students use chemistry tools, as well as on how they can deal with hazardous situations. Because I became a chemist and I want people to benefit from the things around them.

WRITE AND IMPROVE: A MAGNIFICENT TOOL FOR LEARNERS The fundamental purpose of this report is to express the reasons why I find the app called "Write and Improve" brilliant.

Zoological gardens are a controversial component of human society. They provide a safe refuge for endangered or injured animals, but these parks can be abusive in their treatment of creatures as well. There are not only plenty of advantages but also lots of disadvantages to zoos. Firstly, the proponents state that these facilities help us to conserve endangered species. Zoos have brought several animal species back from the brink of extinction. For instance, California condors were down to 27 before facilities in Los Angeles and San Diego started breeding programs to protect them. The survival of several other animals, such as bongos and regent honeyeaters can also be credited to zoos. Secondly, zoos provide an economic boost to their community. Zoos can be local, national, or international attractions that people want to see. These attractions are often safe spaces for young families to come out and enjoy a day together. Apart from this, these facilities can create well-paying jobs, encourage entrepreneurs to be active in their community, and provide indirect profits to local businesses as well. However, the opponents state that when animals are born in captivity, they become dependent on humans. The reason why most of the animals that are in zoos today are the offspring of captured animals from the generation before is the fact that the descendants are unable to cope in the wild by themselves. Furthermore, there is an ethical question that we must answer. Most wild animals thrive when they can live in their natural habitat. When we bring them into an enclosure of any type it can have a direct and adverse impact on their health. Orcas are an excellent example of this issue. Their lifespan sees a reduction of 70% when they live in captivity. In general, the discussions about zoos are very controversial nowadays.

In Thailand, many parents support their children to study abroad in order to get new experiences and improve their languages. There are many advantages of studying abroad, for example students can learn new curriculums or techniques that are not taught in Thai education. Students can improve their language with native speakers of each country that they go to. To learn the traditional culture is a very good experience in students' life. Moreover, students have the freedom to do things that they want, unlike in Thailand where parents always keep their eyes on their children. After the students have graduated from high schools or universities, they also keep contract with other friends around the world. That is very important for their career path in the future. On the other hand, the disadvantages of studying abroad are pretty serious. Some students are unable to adapt to the new environment, so they feel homesick. The language barrier is one of the problems when many people study in other countries. It is important to understand about every day communication. When they have to study hard and have no one to consult, they might have mental problems during their studies. Foreign people are not completely accepted in some countries and they have suffered racism at some stage. In my opinion, it is a good chance to study in another country because there are many new experiences, but students have to prepare themselves so that they can face unexpected incidences.

Video games have become a staple in our modern, technologically driven culture. While kids have been crazy about these for decades, the introduction of smartphones and mobile gaming systems has pushed them to new heights. Often based on fantasy, they also reflect both historical and current events. But whether it's a good or bad thing is up to debate. The proponents state that video games may give unexpected benefits to them, such as better vision. They have been shown to increase players' ability to distinguish the subtle differences in the shade of gray. They may help players improve their ability to detect the direction of movement visually. It was found that gamers spotted targets on a cluttered screen 80% of the time, while non-gamers managed this only 30% of the time. Secondly, video games involve taking risks and the ability to strategize. They teach patience, perseverance, and the right judgment. It also helps people find new friends and social connections. Besides, gamers become better at critical analysis and learn to concentrate on tasks at hand to completion. Thirdly, it has been found that people are more confident, energetic, and emotionally positive when they play video games, which is exactly the opposite of what depression brings about. People who feel depressed lack physical energy, find it challenging to carry out daily tasks, and are generally pessimistic. Thus, playing can reduce the risk of depression, help with arthritis, and even be a therapeutic option for aphasia. However, the opponents state that there are also plenty of disadvantages of video games. Firstly, video games are designed to be addictive, so it is essential to have some self-control. Especially people with poor impulse control or who have a hard time fitting in are most vulnerable to game addiction. Secondly, video games often act as a replacement for real-time human connections. People who find themselves playing hours upon hours of video games may lose touch with the relationships they've built with other people. Thirdly, video game addiction could lead to other levels of psychological stress as well. Gamers may suffer from low self-esteem, have social anxieties, or even suffer from depression. Excessive gaming can also inspire feelings of guilt and shame. It is possible that uncontrolled gaming could enhance the signs and symptoms of other mental disorders. Video games are not bad for you as long as you aren't overdoing them. So, enjoy your downtime and relax with your games, but get out there and keep your life as diverse as possible as well. Because eventually, you have got to win the game of life.

At the end of September 2020, I had a short but fascinating holiday in Switzerland for almost one week. During the summer semester break, I spent the whole time learning programming skills with Python and finishing my seminar thesis in the International Finance chair at the University of Mannheim. It was quite stressful and challenging for me. Therefore, I needed a holiday to relax after that hard time. After a discussion with Max, we decided to have a short holiday in Switzerland. The reasons were as follows: firstly, compared to the holiday expenses in other European countries, the average costs for a holiday in Switzerland are relatively high. We could not afford a vacation for longer than one week in Switzerland. Secondly, due to the COVID-19 emergency, there were fewer tourists in Switzerland. It would be more comfortable and less expensive for us to have a holiday there. Thirdly, we only needed around 3 hours to get from Mannheim to Zurich. Therefore, it was very close to us, and we didn't need to spend much time on the journey. Therefore, we had a fabulous vacation in Switzerland. We saw the modern city of Zurich and the touristic cities like Luzern and Interlaken during these days. Among all the sights, I liked the incredible landscape in Luzern most. It was amazingly beautiful. We booked a hotel on a mountain with a view of the lake and other peaks. I will never forget this incredible view. In conclusion, this was the best holiday for us.

I really don't think that we should change physical books for electronic books because not all people have the opportunity to get a computer, tablet, or smartphone. NA,. books aren't as expensive as electronic devices, books are even repositories where you can get information very quickly, and more importantly, the information that you're getting has been approved by professionals and people that really know about that topic. But the reality is we're living in times where we need to be more ecological and unfortunately books are made principally from trees and looking at the future we're obliged to make a change from physical books to electronic books. There might be people that could think the same as I do, and the question here is, what opinion is correct? In my opinion, I'd like to keep physical books instead of electronic books.

I will always remember visiting the USA for the first time. That was the most exciting holiday I have ever had for several reasons. And, in this article, I am going to mention the reasons why I think so. To get started, I would like to point out that it took place when I had just finished my degree. I was quite young and inexperienced then. Nevertheless, somehow I knew it was going to be one of the greatest experiences one person could ever live. A summer holiday in New York just sounded as perfect as it truly was. Had it not been for the fact that I already had a friend living there, I would have never made the decision of going there that fast. But the truth was that having the support of some close friend who knew that enormous city well, meant the world to me. Visiting New York, the city that never sleeps, simply was like making a dream come true for me. What I first did once I was there was to find a job as a waitress, as I had plans to spend the whole summer holiday there. I met some new friends at my job, and they showed me some important and distinctive places in New York. I remember feeling tiny while I walked around the most famous skyscrapers. I also remember the crowded streets at every single moment, the lights, and the singular cabs of the city. It all was magical for me. Nevertheless, there were some drawbacks that should be mentioned as well. Perhaps it was too much time for me to spend far from home for the first time in my life. It was three months of missing my family, the food at home, my friends, and, especially, my mother tongue. I was not quite good at English at that moment, I have to admit. Last but not least, I would like to conclude by adding that, in spite of those downsides, I would certainly recommend this kind of adventure to everyone. Not only did I learn a lot about what living on your own means, but also about myself and how independent and responsible I can actually be.

Hi Matt, Hope you are doing well and yes it's true we will end our holidays and I will start school. I am quite nervous because I have to improve my English this year if I am keen on passing the First Certificate exam, and after that, I should improve in Science and French. But getting back to my English, I plan to study and invest a minimum of 30 minutes per day, focusing on writing some essays and reading some books. To sum up, I hope it will be enough to get an excellent mark. Best regards, Roger

I think when we are going to answer a question, we have to discuss it from a variety of sides. For example, when we talk about video games we need some information about the context of each game. In my opinion, video games in general are not bad and harmful, but they can be dangerous for children if parents do not notice the kinds of games. If our children play night and day with computers it hurts our children. I spoke about the kind of games: this is very important . Active games are good, but frightening games can hurt children's feelings. Battle is a good thing if you fight with an enemy, but children are fighting with unfamiliar creatures. I agree with children playing video games, but with some conditions. Parents have to control their children and see and know what they play. Governments have to have programs to advance students. Schools should cooperate with students and parents to have a place at school where students can play under the control of their teachers. The most important thing is we increase the level of our children's information so that they do their best and have a good choice.

In this specific report, I want to focus on improving our writing skills on a platform called Write and Improve. I've been using it for more than a few months and all I can say is that I'm really glad I discovered it. I like the possibility of getting educational feedback - surprisingly, it's very specific and I can learn a lot from one report. It helps me understand why I make certain mistakes and how to write my text sounding more formal, which I've been struggling with a lot. The second thing I like is that the workbooks that you write in are organized very well. It helps to know what level you currently are at and gives you important feedback about the quality of your work. Everyone out there, struggling to write texts in English, W&I is on its way! I would highly recommend anyone to use this platform, no matter which language level they are. There is no other app that could help you discover your skills and finally improve them.

Dear John, Hope you are doing well. I am writing to you to explain to you about the last film I saw, "The Deep Ocean," which was one of the worst films I have ever watched. However, I would like to remind you my favorite film was "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" broadcasting by Sean Connery and Nicole Kidman. The plot is related to a magic world with some witches and warlocks where you could experience and enjoy the adventures of three teenagers. I highly recommend this film because you will enjoy watching it and entering into this magic world. I am looking forward to hearing some comments after my advice. Best regards, Roger

When I started with Write and Improve my English writing was poorly. I felt insecure about how to start and how to create sentences in a new language. But, in a few months, with the help and feedback of Write and Improve, I experienced a huge advance. The interface helps you to understand your mistakes with the Feedback and gives you the opportunity to rethink the sentences you've created. I really like the platform, I think it is intuitive, easy to use, and well thought out. You can find Your Progress, the Feedback, and the Changes you've made in your text (that's very useful!), and also a Task Timer if you want to monitor how much time it takes you to write in English. Another feature that is really important (and the reason why I want to improve my English writing) is the Test Zone, here you can find IELTS Academic and General Training Tests. I can't find anything I don't like about the Write and Improve platform, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to increase their English writing level.

I think all students need to learn a new skill and do volunteer work. The teaching system in our high schools is based on learning and teaching without using and applying our information. When we finish high school we have two choices. First we can go to the market and start work or we can go to college and continue our studies. In both of them , I think it is better that we have a skill. Imagine that a student after 12 years wants to start a job ? What can he/she do ? In high school we studied and may have a little experience. It is important that we start a job that we know about and it is not only familiar to us but also desirable for us. It is possible if we learn about the work, we want to have it in the future. Or maybe we want to go to university and continue our studies. Our choice and major will depend on our experience . I suggest that the managers of high schools speak with their students be to be aware of their favorites and make a plan . With experience students will succeed.

In an article I read that health is not only that we eat correctly and have the right diet but also our body needs food for its soul . In my opinion music is our soul food . With music your behaviour will be better. I agree that all schools have music classes and students should have to study music and learn to play a musical instrument. It is 100% essential and necessary for them to learn music. Playing music has some benefits . As an example: 1 - Decrease your stress. 2 - Increase your ability to accept yourself. 3 - Music is a friend for your free time. 4 - You can earn money by playing or teaching. I think music can brighten your perspective and change your beliefs . In some religions they play special instruments to tell their thoughts. Buddhists play a special device or in church the piano is a holy instrument . In the north of America people believe that they can protect their land from an enemy and ghosts by playing drama. In the war , the army use special instruments to tell about the situation.

Could you imagine our world without the seasonal changes? Would you rather choose the heat of the sun's rays than the power of fireplaces? Follow me, as long as you want me to tell you a colourful story! By choice, I find the hottest season of the year more exciting! First of all, summertime always comes with longer days and brighter sunshine in a clear sky. Wonderful reasons to become happier. Since the weather is warm and the days are sunny, it's clear it is the best time to go to the beach or for a woodland walk, spending unforgettable summer holidays. On the other hand, the sunlight has a beneficial effect on the plants. Therefore, the trees are full of leaves and many fields are filled with lots of amazing flowers, such as sunflowers or lavender. Furthermore, this time is also great for the crops of wheat and corn which wave in the summer breeze and are ripe in July. During the summer some flavorful fruits turn ripe as well: cherries, apricots, peaches, and melons. To sum up, my favourite season is revered for its pleasant characteristics, giving us joy and hope!

Hello, I think many teachers can help students to learn a larger variety of skills. More than one teacher means that students have a chance to benefit from more than one teaching style and more than one learning style. The students who have only one teacher maybe learn only bad ideas for several years. The possibilities of not having only an incorrect way of being brought up are less when having many teachers. Teachers are a big influence on students' character. That is why there must be more than one teacher to let the students be able to learn from many different knowledge sources. The students who have only one teacher will become a similar human to the teacher they have. We will not be surprised, if the whole class have the same career, do the same sport, and love doing the same things. They will all behave in the same way their teacher behaves. Thanks!

Subject: Future School. To begin with, we know that school is the first building block in the progress of a nation. Everyone learns to write, read, and speak. If there is a strong school, then there will indeed be a strong nation. Second, at this time schools are more modern than in the past, because every country now wants to improve their education and achieve strong growth in all areas: economics, politics, agriculture, and sciences. There are a lot of plans for educational development I'm going to talk about, but we must not forget that the technological revolution is an important reason for change everything towards evolution. Third, I think we will not see any schools in the future that are the same as schools now, we will see just electronic schools and all education will be online. I know this is impossible to achieve in our time, but in the near future this will be possible. Finally, with Covid19 everything changed. The world will change more, all schools will be only online. Schools will be a virtual world, as will the teachers, subjects, and materials. I hope the technology brought in with Covid19 does not mean our everyday life routine changes more quickly than it is doing now.

English is a global language that is used for formal and informal communication. It has become a worldwide standard for communication because of two reasons. First, it is easy to learn as compared to many languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Urdu. Second, the number of native English speakers of the total world population is about twenty percent. Therefore, we need to learn it and master it. There are a lot of quality courses available which are free of cost for English learners. One of them is the Oxford English speaking course. The main reason I am learning English is to become successful in my life. In my past, I encountered a lot of discrimination because of a poor understanding of English. That gave me a reason to pursue learning English. Now I have been improving my English because of my hard practice.

I think that it is important to learn or speak a foreign language compared to the past. First of all, these days we can travel easily all over the world. Even though we do not go to other countries, we will meet or see people from other countries because they will visit our country. They do not know our country, so it might be that they ask some questions on the street, in stations, or buildings. In that moment, we should answer the question and help them to give them a good experience or memory of our country. Secondly, recently our job characteristics have been changing. For example, a boss from another country comes to our company, or we need to communicate with people or companies from other countries. Unless we speak the other country's language, it will be difficult to get or raise a good position. For these reasons, I really believe that we have to learn or speak a foreign language and it is more important than in the past.

There are different opinions about this subject, whether now or old. Previously people didn't learn a foreign language because they considered it offended. and people felt this was not important because there were no foreigners in their countries. Then Arabic people discovered petrol . Saudi Arabia started to employ thousands of American engineers and chemists. After they mixed together people understood the benefits of learning languages. two languages, maybe Arabic and English. In the last few years learning languages has become more popular among young people. For example, in the city of Jeddah there are girls that speak more than one language. This is interesting news if you know the existence of such young people in your country. Finally, my personal opinion is if I was learning there d language I wouldn't waste time on self - education. I will live in the mother country of the language.

As we are living in a liberal democracy, based on values like free choice and individualism, I strongly oppose the idea of coercing students to do sports. Although a healthy and active lifestyle is crucial for a both long and fulfilled life, I do think that nobody should be obliged to do sports. Rather than deciding about the way other people should live their lives, we should try to dig deeper and mitigate the underlying causes of bad health. In my opinion, probably the best way to achieve this is by vastly increasing the spending on nutritional education. Even the youngest members of our society must know the negative side effects of certain foods and be able to differentiate between healthy and potentially damaging ingredients. Furthermore, we have to highly step up our efforts to reach poorer families in less affluent neighbourhoods with programs like free sports courses for children under the age of five. In this way children get used to doing sports, because they would not know a life without sports. Imagine for a second that we as a society achieved both aims. Erudite, sporty young people know exactly what to eat and behave accordingly, therefore programs like forced sports classes would not be necessary anymore. Obviously we could do a lot more than that, starting from free, healthy lunch at school and ending probably with incentivising the location of medical practitioners in rural areas, for the benefit of our descendants. However all of these measures need the backing of a broad political majority, which is not accomplished easily and needs further engagement from all of us in debates at every level of politics. Finally, I can only repeat my pledge to oppose any type of forced sports classes decisively, and to substitute them with early education programs for everyone.

Dear teacher, I am fascinated doing your English classes, however I want to go beyond the English language. I am thinking that it could be a good idea to incorporate additional subjects related to language to our courses. I wanna do that because I realized that multiple subjects could improve our skills in a more general way, I mean, by opening up our brain to new knowledge. If that is possible, we could start next semester when everyone is fresh after holidays. Please, help me with this new challenge, I know you are super professional and a kind teacher. What do you think? Cheers Juan Pablo

There is no doubt that besides entertaining, television can also educate. It is possible to find a large number of programs with all kinds of content. It is possible to learn about cooking, a new language, how to improve any kind of study, and many other options. On the other hand, people have to have control on account of the large variety of programs that television offers. Any distraction can disturb the principal goal of studying. To sum up, it is very easy to find any program for studying on television. Although it is very easy to find some distraction as well. A person who wants to learn something through television has to be very self-centered and determined or he or she will be one more victim that spends a lot of time in front of the television and will be a famous "coach potato."

November 2, 2020 The Town Council My Dear Town Council: The freedom of free exercise is guaranteed to every American citizen by the First Amendment of the Constitution. However, this freedom is at odds with a recently proposed idea to ban mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I disagree with the banning of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Firstly, all citizens are guaranteed the freedom of free exercise. So, the Town Council cannot ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants unless people are doing something against the law. So, the Town Council cannot implement this ban because it goes against the First Amendment. This is a major reason why I disagree with banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In addition, mobile phones make it easier for people to pay for goods, services, food, and public transport. If the Town Council implemented this ban, then people would have to carry lots of coins and paper currency whenever they want to buy something at a shop or eat at a restaurant. This means that if this ban is carried out, it would make people's lives much harder. This is another reason why I disagree with banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In summary, I disagree with the ban of the usage of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants both because it is against the Constitution, and that it makes people's lives harder. I hope that the Town Council rethink their decision and cancel this ban after reading this letter. Yours sincerely, Daniel

Some people think that it is a good idea for people not to lie, while others say it is acceptable not to tell the truth. However, I believe that every individual should try to tell the truth always because it would help people to build a connection of trust between each other, I think it is acceptable to tell a lie when it does not hurt other people. On the one hand, some think that it is necessary to always tell the truth. This is because people can build a strong bond between each other by telling the truth always and this type of connection mostly does not break. For instance, a 2015 report by UK government found that pupils aged between 5 and 12 share a stronger friendship than young people because children do not lie as young people do. So I agree it is very important to try not to lie to others, especially to loved ones. Other people would say that sometimes it is okay to tell a lie rather than the truth. One reason for this is in some situations where the truth will hurt and can have a negative impact on one's life. For example, according to extensive research, couples sometime lie to save their marriage. I think it should be acceptable to not always tell the truth. To conclude, although views differ whether it is okay for people to lie sometimes, I would argue every individual must try to tell the truth first which allows people to share a healthy bond.

Video games are very popular with children. Some people say they are good for children to improve their brain and make them more intelligent. Also, some say that they are good because when a kid cries and they want to do their business they give him a cell phone and he will be playing and leave them to do their work. And others say it harms them because they stay a lot of time on the phone and this not useful for their eyes or their body, and in the future they will be sick. I think I stand with the second group of people. It's dangerous for the children because they play many hours and it is harmful. The blame lies with families because they want to feel relaxed and do their business in a quiet time at the expense of their kids, and they will pay for their recklessness in the future. At the end of this topic, I tell all parents to take care of their kids.

Some people think that it is necessary to learn a foreign language like it was before, while others say it is of no benefit nowadays. I believe that it is more important these days to know other languages because it provides an opportunity to make new friends and helps to get a well-paid, skilled job. One reason for this is that people travel across borders to experience new cultures. Knowing the language of other countries helps people to fill the communication gap, so that people can interact with each other freely and become friends. For instance, a survey by the French government found that people who know foreign languages can make new friends easily and enjoy the culture of a country best when compared to people who don't know the native language. Therefore, I think foreign languages are very important and should be taught in middle school. Another reason why I think that a foreign language is of a lot of benefit is because it makes it easy for people to send enquiries and do business between countries which don't share a common language. For example, a report by the Chinese government found that people who want to do business hire an agent or use translators just to communicate with local people. In return, agents charge a lot of money. Companies can save a lot of money just by learning that particular language. In conclusion, although it may not be easy for people to learn other languages, I believe it can help to explore new countries and open a bridge between countries for export and import.

The School of the Future is going to be very different from today's. I am not sure if it will change for better or for worse, but the only thing I am a hundred percent sure of is that it will be different. The main reason why I believe that is because technology has a big influence on all subjects in the world, and school is going to be influenced by technology like the other subjects. If we compare school now with school some years ago, we can see that it has changed a lot. For example, not many years ago teachers used to use chalk to write on a blackboard, but now they normally use a pen or an electronic board, where they don't need to use any pen at all. The most important thing is, is the school going to be better? Is the teaching method going to be more effective than now? These are questions that we can't answer now, we will just be prepared to say if the changes were good or not when the future comes.

Nowadays, there are more options for studying and improving the preparation than in the past. In spite of the evolution of the school arrangements, there are always advantages and drawbacks as well. Thus, what are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad? Firstly, a student who has studied abroad at least some months, has more job opportunities than other students. In fact, the most important societies and industries of the world have always been searching for a young graduate with this background. Secondly, studying abroad improves one's language skills, English in this case. It is verified by various research studies, which stated that going abroad to study or work helps to learn a foreign language fast. Moreover, it can make a person feel more confident, with an improvement in their social relationships. However, there are also some possible drawbacks. For example, it comes at great cost, from an economic point of view. NA,. a further issue might be the distance between a student and his family. It is not so easy to leave everything and go to another country that is totally different and so far from home! It corresponds to breaking all of our habits and starting again. It takes a lot of time to get used to a new, different (and strange sometimes) lifestyle. In any case, it is an incredible experience that can change our own life and will remain in our mind forever.

Do not ban the use of mobile phones in public places I am writing this letter because I saw your article this morning about your idea to ban mobile phones from restaurants and other public places. I would like to share my opinion about this idea, so you can hopefully change your mind. The first thing to mention is that all the people in this country are free to choose where they want to use their mobile phone. Using a mobile phone in public places is not a crime and therefore it should not be banned. Besides this, a lot of people use their phone for functional purposes. For example, when an employee has a work meeting with an employer they can meet each other at the workplace, but it is also possible that one of them works in a restaurant and the other one works from home. In this case they need to call each other. For this reason, it would be very impractical when phones are not allowed anymore in restaurants. When I was reading your letter I could understand what your intention was to ban mobile phones. I was feeling your frustration when I read your letter about the fact that everyone is, at every moment, only focused on their screen. This means that nobody is making new contacts anymore when they are, for example, on their way. Also, the social aspect in a restaurant or shop disappears, because people do not talk to each other anymore. But in this case, I would like to suggest making people aware of their actions instead of banning phones from public places. In conclusion, I have noticed your letter and I will be aware of my actions in the future, but I do not think it is a well-taken decision to forbid mobile phones from public places. ,

Some prefer to live longer without adventures. Others, however, are concerned that once in a lifetime means there is no second chance. Thus, they would attempt to challenge everything they can and go on adventures when they are living in the world. As far as I am concerned, living an exciting and extraordinary life is more valuable than a long but boring life. There are several points that will be addressed below. Firstly, lost time is never found again. No one can predict whether the afterlife exists or not, therefore, we should seize the moment and try to challenge the unknown when we are young. Those difficulties and challenges we have conquered will turn into unforgettable memories in our life eventually. Additionally, human beings are fickle. Some people choose a peaceful life at first. However, when they are dying, they start regretting countless things they have not done before. Those people who desire to live in peace and quiet would avoid doing unpredictable actions which may bring unstable and risk factors into their life. However, once people get older, they still need to face health issues. For instance, some old people may have dementia or they are out of action. It not only brings problems but also becomes a part of the burden to their families and offspring. Thus, it seems living too long still may not have a good quality of life even though the life is peaceful. To conclude, everyone will face the end of human life, thus the quality of life is more important than quantity, and we should value quality.

Most people watch exciting shows or movies on television to entertain themselves. The question is whether TV can also be used for educational purposes. Regarding this topic, opinions are mainly divided into two groups. Some of them think that we can use television for education. Others argue that television is dominantly used for entertainment, and it is difficult to use it for education. The supporters state that we can use various television programs to educate our children or accelerate our knowledge about a new field. For instance, there are plenty of English learning programs or basic cognitive training programs for children. They are well designed for children with many funny features to learn new knowledge and are not dull. Furthermore, there are also many different documentary videos for adults to extend their horizons. However, opponents argue that it is quite challenging to implement this ideal concept with television. Since there are so many obstructions when watching TV. For example, they pay much more attention to funny scenarios than to content. Furthermore, many advertisements disrupt children from learning. Finally, most children, as well as adults, are more likely to use television to watch shows or movies than learn new knowledge.

Among all the seasons, winter is my favourite. Just think about Christmas, snow, and Santa Claus. Winter is the best season to relax. For example, after returning from school you decide to cover yourself in a blanket and sip a cup of hot chocolate, while you are watching TV. This is something that never happens in other seasons. I love seeing streets covered in snow. Also, when Christmas is approaching I really like to see the decorations on trees, people walking wearing warm clothes because it is really cold outside. I think that winter is my season because I really love being warm while outside the weather is freezing. These little things are what I like to see. It is also the perfect time to have parties with friends, or spend some time talking about what you are going to do in the afternoon. There is no better season than winter.

I want the school to improve the library because all students use this place every day. The library should have enough private tables for students and provide meeting rooms for group learners. The librarians have to organise meeting rooms through online booking. This method is very easy and convenient for every student. For the learning area, I am pleased with the comfortable environment, like warm and cozy rooms. The school should renovate some rooms by repainting them or changing furniture. The science equipment in the chemistry and physics laboratories should be changed. Student will improve their skills and knowledge when they do a lot of science experiments in a good laboratory. This year is my last year in school, so I want to do a project about bio-compost. Every day there are many waste products from the canteen. If I can change this waste into compost manure for farmers, it can reduce the waste from the school. Moreover, this is the good lesson for students where they learn to protect the environment. I can achieve my goal if the school and teachers support my group by giving a budget and equipment. I hope that the school will agree to my demand in this new school year.

Actually. When I was studying in high school, I was learning English theoretically. But I didn't do that because I was busy with university entrance exams. So my level was going down, Then I began studying at King Khalid University for a period of 4 years. Additionally, I applied for jobs. I could not find any job because speaking English is a job requirement. So this year was a difficult year to learn English, which is very tiring, especially listening and writing. I am trying to see how I can master the language in the future. I want people to take advantage of the IELTS exam, for example, an online teaching workshop for different ages, plus it's a free course.

To: Glenda Smith, English teacher at West Academy From: Michelle Inglis Subject: A new school year Introduction This report describes what should be done to achieve our goals in this new school year. Reading skills To begin with, we have been practising our reading skills for ages and we are pleased to see that we can now understand longer and more complex texts about a wide variety of topics. Listening, speaking, and writing skills On the other hand, more listening, speaking, and writing practice must be added in order to use English more effectively and do well in our studies. Working hard to achieve our goals More specifically, we are expected to listen to as many audio recordings as possible to help us understand extended speech about unfamiliar topics. In addition, we might improve our writing by analysing different written assignments. Moreover, as long as we practise our conversational skills in pairs or groups, we will communicate better and we might become more fluent speakers. Conclusion To sum up, I believe that if the above recommendations are carried out, our English level will be improved considerably and all our goals will be achieved.

It'd be interesting to observe, but I doubt you can charge someone with not going outside. That's simply not feasible. Although I'm fully aware of these "social diseases" and openly support a healthy lifestyle, even though I'm no fanatic, you can't expect the people to just rise from whatever place they're sitting and go to play football, or something similar. And of course, yes, I know we are discussing the schools, and other similar institutions, where this could be somehow possible to require, but think about that. It's completely included in the capabilities of schools and universities, to proceed with the standard P. E. Classes, in this case, I would simply augment the time - dotation. If it isn't satisfying the requirements, or the effect is not perceptible, the best thing to do is upgrade the system of lectures, simply innovate in this field, and bring some new procedures and techniques, if we're talking directly about the sports, then develop or involve some new games etc.. From my point of view, the most recognizable, acceptable and cheapest way would be starting a whole brand new campaign, of massive proportions and range. I'd make it effective, then of course affective, in a friendly way (we don't need any violence). It should appeal to people and give them new insights. You have to motivate the crowds! For me this is the most compromising way. I can not agree with the introducted statement, we can't directly force anyone. This could be acceptable, let's say, maybe during the war, or other similar events, when a capable population is expected, and you can easily reshape young people. But it shouldn't be done this way. It's way too drastic and unnecessary.

Health or wealth? With the development of new technology and society, the amount of consumer goods to meet human demand increases dramatically. Meanwhile, more and more people are driven by their desire to consume and want to work harder to get richer. It is interesting to discuss whether health is more important than wealth. Some argue that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Others disagree with it. However, the answer to this question depends on various factors, such as an individual's financial situation, the comprehensiveness of social security, value choices, and personality. Since these factors vary for different people and countries, it is no wonder that people have different preferences. For instance, most employees work around 72 hours per week in China. Because they usually have high expenses and a mortgage debt to pay. Furthermore, there is no adequate social security. Chinese must save money for themselves and their parents, just in case. As a result, many people have already been suffering from various health problems at a very young age. In a fast-developing society, it is hard for people who are not driven by an overwhelming desire to consume. Therefore, most Chinese decide to work harder to get richer. Nevertheless, many Germans choose another lifestyle than the Chinese. Many Germans decide to have a fun and relaxing job and have a better work-life balance. Most people in Germany work no more than 40 hours per week. Some of them even only work 20 hours weekly to have more free time for their family or their hobbies. Because social security in Germany is relatively comprehensive and sufficient, people don't have so much uncertainty to worry about.

Some people believe that health is more important than wealth, I have the same concept as them. Money cannot buy health despite having the ability to acquire the best medical system. However, money is earned through hard work. If our health is affected, how will we be able to concentrate on our work to bring the bacon home? Therefore, it is vital that we remain healthy so we can focus on our work to put food on the table. Nowadays, there is a rapid growth of competition in the market as the world is constantly changing, thus people are fighting to keep their jobs and solve their bread and butter issues forgetting how important their health is in a stressful environment. Being overworked can lead to health problems, such as fatigue, an increased chance of having hypertension, and other health problems. But there are some health problems that are incurable, take the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), despite nations pouring money into research a cure has yet to be found. On the other hand, health can bring joy in our life. For example, if someone is on a trip enjoying parties and all sorts of crazy things while being healthy, but all of a sudden he falls ill, not being able to spend his last few days on this wonderful trip, everything will turn into anguish. Furthermore, if you are healthy, you will be able to gain wealth. The reverse is not possible. Health gives you the ability to enjoy what life has to offer and create experiences that are often more cherished than physical goods. Therefore, I conclude that health is more important than money although money can bring joy to some people's life, but greed will one day overcome them, turning them into demons.

My best holiday for me was in 2017 when I went to Germany. From the 19th of June to the 19th of July, I practiced in a food safety laboratory in the city of Munich. That was the first time for me to live far away from my home. For one month, I travelled around Munich and I had a chance to travel to Austria and the Czech Republic. This was a very good experience for me to see a lot of architecture of the Middle Ages. There are many beautiful and fascinating buildings in Munich, even though some of them had been destroyed in World War II. I am interested in the history of World War II, so seeing and going to the real place of the war history is like my dream fulfilled. German people have been facing a tough time since the end of the war. Most of the important places and people's faith were devastated. After not many years, the German government restored places, public facilities, the economy, and technology and they got into the top 5 of European trade. I am impressed with the German effort and unity in order to reunite their nation. This summer was my best holiday ever.

Television has a big responsibility in the world. It makes our culture and has a huge effect on people's behaviour, beliefs, and how they fill their free time. Television has some role in changing the opinion of society. The majority of its fans are children and old people, because adults are always at work and have no free time to watch its programs. So it is essential that governments have noticed to kind of program. Television plays a key role in education . It is easy to connect with to use its programs for the whole world. We can educate children , make their future, give them good ideas, and help them to progress, or instead of good and useful programs show dangerous films. Television can change our habits. If we have free time, with the use of television it will be a good time or maybe a bad time .

In recent years, more and more people join universities or colleges after they graduate from senior high schools. However, the university life is totally different from senior high school life or before that. About the concern of living at home or not, my opinion is as follows. For me, moving away and living on their own while attending the university or college is a better choice than living at home. In the late of the student life, living outside can learn and acquire more skills and knowledge than living at home. Before entering the workforce, undergraduates not only have to learn the professional skills but the social skills and self-care ability. Undergraduates can learn or acquire these competences more quickly if they move away and live on their own. They need to do everything by themselves, such as go to classes, mop the floor, wash clothing, and so on. Therefore, living away they may learn more than living at home.

Regarding the question, 'Exercise is essential for our health, but are there more important things?', opinions among people are quite different since each one has his own preference. For instance, I would like to say that money is more important for me than exercise, even if regular exercise is necessary to keep healthy. However, it doesn't mean that I don't do any exercise at all, or health doesn't matter to me. Due to a stressful financial situation and high living expenses, I have no choice but to work harder to get more money to finance this. Therefore, compared to exercise, I will prioritize work. Nevertheless, I usually do a Zumba workout every week to keep me fit. Since if I am not fit and always sick, I cannot finish my task as planned. However, some may disagree with me. Health has absolutely the highest priority for them. Therefore, there is nothing else that is more important than exercise. And such people usually have a perfect work-life balance.

Exercise is important for everybody's health. Not only exercise, but also diet and good mental health are components of having a good life. People should exercise at least 30 minutes for 3-5 days per week and they also have to have healthy food. Healthy food for me is food that has a lot of nutrients and is fresh. In order to have good health, people should have a range of fruits, vegetables, and meat every day and avoid ready-to-eat food, canned food, soft drinks, and fast food. Nowadays, most people are interested in plant - based whole food that most diet come from plant. People can eat protein from other sources such as high-protein plants, instead of meat. This diet can improve humans' health better. To have good metal health, there are many methods that can help you, like doing meditation in your free time, travelling in vacation time, and not being stressed.

Zoos shouldn't exist. They aren't good for animals. They should live in real life. They need space. Wild animals also have their space. There is no animal which lives in a zoo and has as much space as they do when they live in the wild. Secondly, zoo animals are also living creatures. They are just like humans. We also wouldn't like it if we had to spend the rest of our lives in a cage waiting to eat for when the caregiver gives food. We like to move and eat whenever we can, so do zoo animals. People pay a lot for zoos put the zoo animals only get some food from that money. They don't get a bigger space. They just have to stay in their cage, so people can watch them and pay.

I think that's a hard thing because some people say "I want to be rich and I don't care about my health." And that's so wrong. In my opinion, being healthy is more important than being rich. Why? Because it doesn't matter if you are rich but your lia with the bad and you can't do anything in your life. For example, Steve Jobs, he died from cancer and this man was very rich and he wanted to pay every dollar he had to recover. But that could not happen. And in my opinion, to be healthy is very important. So, I saw some people who are not rich and they also don't care about their body and that's insane.

Write & Improve is an online platform provided by Cambridge Language Assessment. It helps an English student (or learner in general) to improve his vocabulary and writing skills. In my opinion, it is very helpful and stimulating because, for example, it can check a written text and give some advice about it. This feedback is good for an autodidact and for every English learner. Moreover, W&I is characterized by many examples and models of a possible writing test. In fact, there is a so-called 'Test Zone'. Furthermore, there are W&I workbooks, in order to train daily with different topics: from sport to study, from the environment to technologies and so on. These workbooks are divided into sections which depend on the English level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. For someone who wants to improve his business English, there is also a section called 'W&I Business'. However, I don't like the restricted number of the Writing Test mock exams. After completing all the 'free' topics, the others are blocked. If you want to unlock them, you should pay. If I were my classmates, I would start using Write & improve. I recommend it to everybody.

Nowadays, video games are part of children's life. These days kids grow up with technology and virtual games and its pros and cons. As parents, our responsibility is to manage our children's time on the computer and try to schedule it. Video games are a good way to develop motor skills and sometimes to learn languages. It is proved that playing video games helps to improve coordination and multi-tasking skills, and enhances memory; for these reasons, video games are a good tool for entertainment and to develop children's brain speed . In contrast, the abuse of these game platforms is negative for children who spend their whole day playing video games, they can trigger violence, cause a bad performance in school, and cause health problems, like anxiety, obesity, or stress. I think that playing video games is a good resource to help kids improve their cognitive development, however, we have to be conscious about the abuse of these games and we have to control the use of these video-game consoles for kids.

The future of travel Nowadays, there are already various ways to travel, for instance, by bus, train, or plane. It is already much faster than travelling in the middle ages as people usually travelled on carriages. And it was very slow, and the journey was more likely limited to a regional one. Due to the dramatic development of technology and a further demand for travel, future travel is expected to be faster, cheaper, and more comfortable. For instance, it is not difficult to imagine that typical vehicles such as self-driving cars that can fly will be widely used in the future. This new vehicle can be used not only for a short-distance trip but also for a long-distance journey. Correspondingly, international trips will be more personalized and flexible, since almost everyone could fly in his car. And this new change may decrease the usage of large planes dramatically. Furthermore, travel to outer space with spacecraft may also come true, and the trips for humans will not be limited to the earth anymore. Finally, with the further application of virtual reality technology in travel and work, it is reasonable to imagine that people will do fewer real trips and more virtual ones.

Medicine is one of the fannest major majors around the world, but in some countries it is a bridge to success to earn a lot of money and social character. The opinion and culture of each area makes their attitude ,so first we have to detect their culture and beliefs. Unfortunately , a lot of medical doctors have forgotten their oath and only think about money and an easy life. In my opinion ,some of the important reasons for this decision are: 1- Money is important and has the most important role in their life. 2 - They are not responsible for their society. 3 - Rural areas have less facilities. 4 - The policy of governments that have forced them to work in a rural region. If we want to change their attitude ,we have to force them and they have to sign a paper that they will go to rural areas for at least one year. The second step is that the government increases their income and gives them some scores . Another reason that they do not want to go to far places is their family . If we change the face of villages and have progress, the policy will succeed.

When Banu, who is my friend, saw a big cat she started to cry. We were surprised. We did not understand what happened. I asked her what happened. Banu said "l do not like cats. When l see a cat l am scared." So, we enjoyed the trip. We saw different animals. We shared lots of things with friends.

I don't see any problem with being as old as the whole century. I mean, health and medical services are surely going to be not only more accessible, but also better, faster, more precise and less painful. Imagine being a centenarian, but feeling like in your mid-sixties. I'm not afraid of that. When these demands are fulfilled, I am for the first option. I just like my pace. Maybe I used to be a bit ferocious, but how many people in their teenage years didn't? There is no need to live your life intensively, without any sleep, practically surviving from day to day. In my humble opinion, settling down, eventually not moving a house much, having a good wife, husband or any other partner, maybe make some kids, doing a stable and prospering job, going for culture and simply fighting with the life normally. You may enjoy the rush, adrenalin and joy of your short life, but it's important to realize that any one of us can hide a great potential. In your later life, some people can contribute to this society so much and although some geniuses have died relatively young, they can't be the majority. In my humble opinion, a shorter life can be a waste. But, live your life, whatever you want. That's our basic right.

I went with my friends to Acapulco and it was the first trip without my parents, and it was even more important because my other friends and I didn't ask for permission. It was the best holiday that I ever had because it was so different. I could go with my friends and we went around like beaux conquering girls. We walked on the beach and liked to drink some beers. We didn't have enough money, but it wasn't important. It was the best holiday because it was a new thing that I did in my life. I think that if a vacation is improvised, it can be better than when you plan it. And when you improvise with your friends to do something new it can be the best thing you do when you are young.

Why? Which are my reasons? What motivates me every day? To tell you the truth, I didn't want to learn English during my childhood. I hated it. I was only interested in Spanish. But I noticed later that English is necessary if someone like me wants to work abroad or with international companies. So, I had to start with English, I hadn't a choice. This was my first reason. Then, after several months, I began to enjoy this language. The fact is that now I could access a lot of new cultures. Let me put it another way. English is the most spoken language in the world. Knowing that, when you're able to speak English, you can talk with people all over the world, understand the customs of most countries and so many things. That's why I'm working every day.

In the university dorm you live with other people that come from a different family with a different culture and there are varieties of ideas . In this condition you learn how to behave with them . Another reason is that when a student lives on her / his own, she / he learns how to spends her / his money and not waste money.,. this condition makes a person stronger and sociable and independent .

Vehicles play a vital role in humans' life because we use vehicles for travelling . Today, many scientists are trying to fix the problem of road congestion as there has been a large increase in the number of cars on the road. They are figuring out how to decrease traffic congestion and road congestion. According to Dr.Paul, they have invented a flying car in order to reduce traffic congestion for the future. As the world is progressing, in the future you can expect self-driving cars on the road. Besides these kinds of cars, they are planning to build smart roads in order to decrease accidents and road deaths. I think that this is the future of the whole world. Nonetheless, I think airplanes will remain the same although other ways of travel can change in the future. Because, travelling by plane is convenient. It is the best way to travel from one country to another. To sum up, even if we were able to invent flying cars and self-driving cars in the future, we cannot say if life will be convenient because everything comes with ease and also drawbacks.

I am an 18-year-old student and have been studying English for almost 6 years now. For a long time, I was looking for a tool which may help me to improve my English writing skills because they are awful. But most of the programs or tools are expensive and as a student I cannot pay them. A while ago, I found "Write and Improve." It is a tool which is organised by Cambridge University and is absolutely great. First of all, it is almost free. You can use most of the tools without paying anything. Depending on your English skills, you can choose between different difficulties. They are called workbooks in which you find, depending on your individual level, tasks for practising. After doing a task, you receive immediately feedback from the program. It includes your English level and mistakes you made. However, you can find a test zone for some exams Cambridge University offers. If you want, you also can create own workbooks. In my opinion, this tool is really good if you want to improve your English or prepare yourself for an exam. It will not replace a real teacher because it is only a program but for beginning it might be helpful. If you decide to sign in in the mailing list, you will also receive a lot of helpful tips. I can recommend Write and Improve but also have to say there might be better ones if you are ready to pay some money for a good program like Grammarly.

Talking about television entertainment, there are a variety of television programs broadcast on television, such as comedies , documentaries , reality shows, dramas, and so on. Regardless of gender and age, people like watching these television programs . Some people frown upon some kinds of programs, such as game shows and advertisements because they think a lot of advertisements are a form of lying and they can make people feel depressed and discontented with their ordinary lives, especially those people who have only a small amount of money to spend on luxuries . And parents do not want their children to spend so much time watching game shows. On the other hand, I think that we can benefit from watching programs such as dramas, wildlife documentaries, and educational shows . Moreover, you can relax by watching comedies or something like that when you are mentally tired . What's more, people still get their news primarily from TV, and a few cartoons intended for kids can also teach a couple of things: some moral principles and some lessons. In conclusion, as far as I know, television can not only entertain but also educate us. It is a win-win situation.

Nowadays, in our digital age, with easy access to online translation services, knowing more languages is still as valuable as it was in other times. Personally, I think that, even now, it is worth learning a new language. Firstly, although a computer program could help you with some translation, it is often poor and unnatural. Therefore, you might be lost in translation. That is why I'd rather learn a new language than use translation software. Secondly, what can be more pleasant than traveling? But, our experience wouldn't be enjoyable unless we communicate with local people. Even if we didn't know their mother tongue, we could at least use one of the most spoken languages in the world. Moreover, learning a foreign language might broaden our horizons. For instance, we can find more up-to-date information in numerous fields of activity. Last but not least, multilingualism is good for our health since the grey cells are activated by language-learning and, as a consequence, it improves memory and reduces the effects of brain ageing. In conclusion, I definitely believe that there are lots of reasons for learning a new language even these days.

Zoos are one of the best places for people to not only relax but also learn about our nature. These facilities are significantly important for children to develop. While many people argue that animals belong in nature and they should not be kept in zoos, I strongly believe that zoos also bring many benefits. Firstly, zoos are good places for entertainment. Going to the zoo at the weekend or on holidays is one of the most popular ways many families choose to relax. This activity helps maintain the relationships among family members. For example, after a stressful week of studying and working, parents and children will have a great time at the zoo. They will have a chance to do things together, such as feeding animals, walking along the street as if they were in the forest, or learning about exotic animals. Also, these activities are really important for the development of children. Secondly, it will be more convenient for those who want to learn about animals because they do not have to go directly to the forest where there are many potential threats. Take African elephants as an example, when you want to learn about them, you only need to go to the zoo where elephants are kept, without going to Africa. Furthermore, the study of animals at the zoo is more effective because there are many people who have specialized in nature. In conclusion, although animals actually belong in nature and they should be free, we need zoos because these places help us know more about animals and nature. As a result, people will be more responsible with nature and they will find ways to protect animals.

The computer games industry has enjoyed great success in the last two decades. Only very young people played them twenty years ago, but now it is a common form of entertainment. I must also mention that not only young people play computer games, but also middle-aged and elderly people. However, is it really safe to let your children play video games? In my opinion, parents should check if a particular game is suitable for their children. It is easy to find a game with a lot of violence or improper content that shouldn't be displayed to children. On the other hand, some of the games may have a very positive impact on children. They develop creativity. I believe that playing games may be more beneficial than watching TV programmes. I think that game producers should clearly categorize their games, so it wouldn't be difficult to decide if it is proper for children.

It's possible that, with good management, the animals will be in better condition and it is good for society.

It seems like there is a divide between schools having students not to take any music class and schools forcing students to study and learn to play a musical instrument. Given such divide, it seems plausible that we should let students choose what to study depending on whether he or she likes music. Surely, there is a scientific fact that music can develop students' imagination and perception. Besides focusing on academic studies, music can relieve students' pressure and can have a fair judgement. However, it is not always true that every student has an interest in studying or learning music. Involving music as a requirement could increase students' burden in studying, and therefore, it could affect his or her academic performance in other subjects. Whether he or she likes music or not, the choice should be up to students' preference instead of forcing them to choose what to study or what to learn. Otherwise, it could have a negative impact on students' development.

I think "The Future of Travel" should be eco-tourism. Travelling produces a carbon footprint which affects the environment every year. In my opinion, people must be concerned about this effect. A carbon footprint comes from travelling and waste of tourism so eco - tourism is one of the best options that tourists can choose in order to save the places where they go to. Wherever you go, you should help and keep those places clean. For example, a lot of rubbish from tourism is the cause of many problems in local areas. Moreover, animals, native people, and the surroundings have been affected by smell and sore sightseeing. For this reason, travellers have to look after things around them and support the local people to cultivate a consciousness of loving their hometowns. If other people pay attention to tourist attractions, the inhabitants will love and cherish their habitats. It is good for everyone who wants to travel to any place and has a value attitude towards saving the environment. The sustainability of the surroundings is the sustainability of travel too.

What places do you usually go to for a holiday? My family usually go to a nearby forest for a holiday. I cannot understand why they always go to forests for a holiday. But the holiday we went on last week was amazing. We went to a forest as usual. But this forest was very different from the previous ones we had been to. It was the best holiday I ever had. There were loads of lakes for us to swim in and they even had horses. I love horse riding, but my favourite thing about the holiday was the cabins we stayed in. It was like being in a tree house and we got to stay up late, eat chocolate, and drink soda. There were some kinds of animals in the forest. I saw rabbits, peacocks, monkeys, and some kinds of birds. Some people brought their dogs and played with them around their tent. The moment I looked at them playing with the dogs, I thought to myself that I should have a dog because they are so cute. And at night, we played truth or dare. I love this game because it is so funny, especially the dares. I always choose dares whenever I play this game as I do not want anyone to know my secrets. While we were playing, some people from the next cabin joined us. And the game was much more fun than a while before. We got to know each other and I made new friends. That's why it was the best holiday I ever had. In conclusion, this holiday amazingly raised my spirit. I hope I can go on such a holiday again.

Scientists have proved that exercise brings us many benefits. Doing exercise frequently makes our life a lot better because it improves both mental and physical health. However, there are still many things that are indispensable in life, such as relationships and knowledge because these things play important roles in the success of a person. Firstly, a person cannot live without a network. Every one of us belongs to a certain group of people. Since we were born, we have lived with our families. We go to schools and we have friends and teachers. And, when we work, we belong to our companies. That makes humans different from animals because we have a society and social interaction. The person we have become today is the result of all the interactions with the people we have met. For example, if a child lives with a good and wealthy family, there will be more chances for the child to become a good person in the future. Knowledge is also a powerful tool for humans. This helps us resolve our problems and develop ourselves into a valuable person. This factor is also crucial to the success of people.

In my opinion, offices must have an open and ergonomic design, with no walls separating employees from their co-workers in order to create the best environment for their employees. First of all, it is known that the most successful companies, which have won awards as the best place to work, care for the places' design where their workers perform their activities every day; they don't have walls separating the peers, because they consider that walls can mean a line which restricts the collaboration and creativity inside the company, hence the rate of new strategies and new plans of actions is reduced. Apart from that, it is known that workplace design is an opportunity for companies to promote social wellness and productivity. Hence, it is ideal for a lean and green company to have no walls in the offices so as to foster an environment with more fairness, equality and freedom to express ideas. Additionally, when designing an office, companies are contributing to a key element which is the health of workers, not only physical but also mental. So, according to some studies the spaces where the people work must be wide enough to allow them to walk and clear their minds so as to reduce stress levels, increase creativity and to promote movement in their sedentary lives. On top of that, it is claimed if the offices have ergonomic designs, the productivity of the workers improves because the collaborators feel more comfortable and satisfied. I would like to drive home this vital part, when workers don't have worries about the space where they have to work or they don't have negative feelings about the discomfort and their mental load is reduced as a result, they can focus on what they're doing and have more energy for the activities, as well as leveraging their synergy in teamwork. Finally, I think the spaces for offices should be wide and ergonomic for administrative employees, in order to promote efficiency, creativity and productivity. Added to that, the design of an office is vital for the simple reason that physical workplaces have a huge impact on a wide variety of factors like inclusion, morale, health, productivity and efficiency in collaborators.

When I was younger, I loved to have the same teacher for several years. I believe that it helped me to get better when I had to answer some questions, I got more confident. But I believe that changing teachers for next years could help to build our perspective about life. Furthermore, we're able to develop our connections with people. We're able to feel what other people feel too. I'm trying to look for words to express my mind, but knowing what other people feel is really important for the development of a society. So, creating new connections between people can change the world. Sometimes, I have got upset or uncomfortable with a new teacher, but it's an important thing that has to happen or exist in somebody's life. Furthermore, it develops our abilities of communication and it helps to develop our point of view.

If I didn't have to change teachers, maybe I wouldn't be able to work on my abilities with other people.

Music surrounds human life. Music is a magic thing. Listening to music and playing musical instruments can change our mind. Nevertheless, is everyone familiar with music and should everyone need to know about it? My answer is yes. In Taiwan, we have music classes in the basic education period which provide every student with a basic knowledge of music. However, why should we study music? As I said earlier, music is a magic thing. There are many kinds of music, such as classic, pop, jazz, Bossa Nova, and so on, and it always can lead us into a different mood. In my mind, "music" is one of the greatest ways to release pressure. Through singing songs or listening to music, we may feel happier and immerse ourselves in a relaxed atmosphere. Besides, there is a saying in Chinese "Children who study music won't go bad." Research has showed that the kids who study music have higher stable emotions, concentration and lower nervousness. Studying music has a lot of benefits but without any cons. Let everyone get to know more about music. People may find the changes in themselves.

However, there are some places where people refuse to learn English. For example, countries like France and Spain. Both languages are being spoken in other countries. To conclude, it can also be helpful to learn French or Spanish. Another upcoming language is Mandarin. Mandarin is one of the most spoken languages in the world. The reason for this is because there are billions of Chinese people in the world. They travel around the world, but you see them also a lot in the business world. So my advice is to certainly learn English. Also, choose French, Spanish, or Mandarin as an extra foreign language.

I don't think there is a better choice depening living on your own or living with your parents. I think it depends on your needs and satisfactions. Currently, I am a student. I still live at my parents. However, if it's possible I would like to live on my own. Unfortunately, living on your own can be quite expensive. This is the reason I still live at my parents, it is way cheaper than living on your own. Some students prefer living on their own and choose to borrow money. However, they not only have to borrow money to pay their rent, but also for groceries, gas, water, electricity, etcetera. When you live on your own you have more freedom. You don't have to think about somebody else. You can eat whenever you like, listen to music whenever you want or watch a Netflix show you like. You can't do all these things when you still live with your parents. However, I don't want to have a debt. So my preferences are to still live with my parents and move out as soon as I have a job.

Some people think that it is better to live a long and stable life, while others prefer to have a short and happening life. I believe that it is important to be peaceful and friendly because it allows you to pass your traditions to the next generation and stay close with your family members. To begin with, I believe that it is better to have a long calm life as it allows people to find some spare time so that they can spend quality time with their family members. This would allow them to care for their loved ones and help them to become a successful and better person. In other words, if they spend more time with family members they get close to each other and, as a result, they start enjoying their life. For example, in 2002, Oxford University conducted a survey among people who live with family members or separate from them and found that individuals who live with their families are much happier than other people. Another important point to consider is that people can share their thoughts and beliefs as well as traditions with the next generation, so that family members know about the history of their ancestors. This means that generations will keep on passing the traditions from one to another to keep themselves motivated towards living a healthy life. To illustrate this, studies by the Indian government have found that the majority of families know their traditions mainly because people spend time with their family . To conclude, although people are so busy these days that they like to live an intense life, I think a long calm life helps people to live together and share their thoughts and beliefs.

When we want to describe a person , we use some words like honest, loyal, kind, aggressive, a liar and so on; some of them are positive and some of them are negative . In my opinion , the value of each person can be explained by his/ her behavior. I hate people who lie and think everybody has to be honest. We had a lesson in school whose name was cry wolf . I liked that lesson because we can see some people in our society who are not honest and they say that our lie is a white lie. I could not accept this word. A lie is a lie and it does not change with its size. I would rather tell the truth and be punished because when we tell one lie, we have to tell other lies to give reasons for works. Some people think that the goal can justify the facility and means but I disagree with this sentence. In the world from the north to the south and east to the west ,a lie is a lie and lying people are not acceptable among other people. Parents are symbols for their children . A lying parent could not demand an honest child. Sometimes leaders and politicians do not tell the truth but don't tell a lie. Imagine a bad condition like war.

I have been using this program since last year. I'm grateful that this program exists and got into my life. I love Write & Improve because it has a specific subject for a specific level. For example, I'm an English beginner student and I'm able to develop my writing abilities in this program. I may see my mistakes and errors, and this program shows me where I went wrong and what's wrong with my text. Furthermore, I have used this program to evaluate my development on the Inamara's English course and so far I have been able to improve my English level. So far I've kept up in level B1 in English.

In my opinion, television can do both things together. But today it is very difficult to make television like that because people's expectations are a little bit different. I think nowadays television is well organised in general because there are channels which entertain and others which educate. These two things we can only find on some channels, but today it is very difficult to make programmes like this. So when you are tired after work you can choose a channel dedicated to entertainment. When you would like to learn something new you can find channels about history, politics, or engineering. I think also that more and more channels and programmes are trying to link these two things which are included in the question. I would say it is very difficult because people who do this need to be educated, have a lot of knowledge, be funny, and have a good sense of humour.

I have several reasons why it's important for me to learn English. First, after I graduate I want to study further. I want to study a Master's in Marketing which will be completely in English. One of the requirement is to have an advanced level in English and prove this with a certificate. Therefore, I will take an English exam on December third. Not only is it important to learn English in order to pass my test, English will also be important during my master. During the master you have to write essays, so therefore my English also has to be good. Besides my reasons to learn English for my master, I also want to travel a lot around the world. Therefore, it would be very useful if I spoke English fluently. I am worried that I will get lost in a strange country. If I can communicate well I am reassured that it will be fine.

Nowadays there are a lot of ways to learn on the internet . Many of them are fake but some good applications and websites help academically.  I usually search for good ones that I could recommend for young or advanced learners.     One of the most helpful websites that I found is write&improve.  This a page which you can visit from Google.  To start writing on it, first, click sign in then create an account and then start writing the tasks so that you can know your accuracy level.     One of the advantages that you could rarely find is that it gives you the mistake and lets you correct it by yourself.     Write&improve has many characteristics, such as diverse tasks for beginner, intermediate or advanced people, and it also can train people who are preparing for the IELTS exam in the two kinds of writing.  It also has an icon called "just for fun." This icon has story tasks like this one: if you found a box that that did not bus butt to you but has your name on it, what would you do with it? u00A0U+00A0u00A0. All in all, write & improve is a spectacular website to practise on. Furthermore you will have a great future in writing essays and paragraphs.

There are many means of transport which have been used for generations, but they are becoming obsolete and are replaced by technological advances. I strongly believe that public transport and more environmentally-friendly vehicles will be used popularly in the future because these new technologies help mankind to cope with problems related to the environment, climate change, and population growth. Firstly, using public transport is beneficial for both the environment and the economic situation of people. For example, buses can carry a large group of people at the same time, which reduces the number of vehicles on the street. This will also decrease the carbon emissions significantly. Also, bus tickets are quite cheap compared to gasoline prices. In addition, this means of transport also helps resolve traffic congestion, which will save many people time. Secondly, the development of technology also affects how people travel. Batteries are now more efficient than in the past. There are many cars which use electricity instead of fossil fuel. People are realizing how severe climate change is, so they will use electric vehicles to travel rather than the classic ones to protect the environment.

There are some who believe that taking up a sports activity at least three times a week is beneficial for all types of students. This is because, nowadays, students tend to have an inactive lifestyle. I totally agree with this as due to inactive lifestyle, students face a lot of problems and by doing physical activities they will achieve good health and live healthily. In recent times, many youngsters tend to do less physical activity than ever before. Not opting for an active lifestyle is displayed in their eating habits too, as they usually prefer to order readymade or fast food items online. One reason for this could be that after spending a busy day at university they feel exhausted, so they do not want to spend time on cooking. Due to this, a lot of health issues are being observed in the younger population, for instance, they feel exhausted even if they perform minor physical exercise . Also, they are not very keen to adopt an active lifestyle and just try to do all sorts of work on their gadgets. Therefore, forcing them to do physical activity at least a couple of times a week is good for their physical health. That being said, indulging in physical activities has a lot of health benefits for an individual. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted by The General Health magazine, revealed that people who had an active lifestyle from their childhood days tend to live a healthy and long life. Therefore, it is really necessary that students must be motivated to perform physical activities several times a week. This will help to keep a check on many lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and obesity, which are now very common in youngsters. Also, if students take part in physical activity by indulging in sports then it helps to build team spirit in them. In this way, it is beneficial to perform physical activities for both good physical and mental health. In conclusion, leading an inactive lifestyle could lead to complications in later life. A simple method to control it is indulging in physical activity from an early age.

Most countries around the world use television. It has a lot of uses in many different types of areas, such as education, public health, economics, and entertainment. Television can be education or entertainment. For example, in schools, teachers use television to show education programs for students. Also, in cinema, they use television to show movies. People have choices to pick what they want from a wide range of television. It makes many complicated things easier than in the past. For example, children can teach themselves with television. Teachers use television to show hard experiments for students instead of carrying them out. However, parents can also use television to show entertainment programs for their sons and daughters to keep them quiet so that parents can accomplish many tasks. In my view, all of us need television these days because it has a lot of benefits or uses. So it depends on our choices for it.

Thinking about how to live is one of the most interesting subjects for human beings. While some desire to have a long life span, in my opinion, it is more exciting to live an adventurous life. The main reason to choose a short but intense life is that living in a severe situation can motivate people to live more productively. It means having a calm condition can be boring after a while and you stop making a plan for the future. For example, for a few years I experienced a situation which was without any problems, but after a while I realized that I did not do any useful work for my future. What is more, facing challenges and new things can open our horizon and improve our way of thinking. According to a survey from Oxford University, living in a tough condition can develop the creativity of people. For instance, there are some examples of famous individuals in the world who have had bad conditions in their early life, but could get through that life and become popular. Having said that, human beings like trying immortality to see the future. As a result some prefer living calmly and long to face unknown events. I think this excuse can not be enough to forget about endevouring new changes. In conclusion, although some prefer having a long life without any troubles, in my view, a short life but full of new experiences, is more enthusiastic for people.

Introduction The purpose of this report is to evaluate the Write and Improve website and to answer if it is a helpful tool for learning English. It will also consider possible future developments. I have been using this website for three months now and I have completed around twenty writing tasks. Advantages First of all, there are plenty of writing tasks available on the website. Starting from basic level, the user can make his progress completing more advanced tasks. The check system works very fast. The user only waits a few minutes for the results. Disadvantages Despite the fact that the checking system works very quickly, the answer does not contain information on the type of error made. Basically, it forces you to check what you did incorrectly outside of Write and Improve. In my opinion, the designers of the site should think about changing this solution. Recommendation. I would strongly recommend using the Write and Improve website. Not only does it help develop writing skills but also allows users to express their opinions on lots of different topics.

I went to Panama when I was 10 years old. I saw lots of interesting things like the Panama Canal. It is a famous landmark of human engineering, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to create an essential sea route. This gives the possibility of taking a short and cheap transit route for ships responsible for transporting goods. I also went to an island called Chichime that belongs to a region called Guna Yala. Guna Yala is an indigenous region in Panama, inhabited by the Guna ethnic group. There I passed two days. I swam in the sea and walked around the island. I went to the Biomuseum, too. It is a natural history museum that is located in Panama City. Its intention is to change the way we see, understand, and preserve nature and its biodiversity. It was my favourite trip because I learnt a lot of new and amazing things about the world.

Before I decide what life I prefer I want to clear up the definition of intense. Because what does intense exactly mean? In my words, intense defines a busy life. Not only a life full of adventures but also a life full of hard work and strict deadlines. Taking into consideration this definition, I would prefer a calm life. I choose this one because of personal events. A few years ago my mother got a heart attack. This was a consequence of too much pressure. She wanted to move, wanted to achieve in her job and had too much to care about. It delivered stress and a heart attack. In order to enjoy my life I want to relax. I don't want a lot of stress in my life. I think while having a calm life you can still have a lot to look out for. There are fun things to do and several occasions to celebrate life. Why would you rush your life if you can enjoy it for many more years? I do have a side note to my statement. What I need most in my life is my family and friends. I want them by my side for those 100 years. Because what are celebrations without having someone to celebrate something with? So relax, don't stress and enjoy life.

Should we liberate all animals? In the 21st century, many environmental movements have gained popularity. Some of them have been proposing to eliminate zoos. They argue that all living creatures should be free and deserve better treatment. Are we supposed to open the gates and set the lions and other creatures free? It's an issue we should discuss. Environmental movements claim that animals can be happy only when they live in their natural environment. Personally, I disagree with this view . In my opinion, animals that live in zoos are the lucky ones. They are safe and have food and don't worry that some predator may eat them tomorrow. Although, sometimes it is sad to see such a majestic animal as a tiger being kept behind bars. But we should remember that by doing this, we help to preserve some kinds of animals. For example, pandas would not have survived if we had not kept them in zoos. Moreover, I think that children can learn something by going to the zoo. In the future they may become nature lovers. In conclusion, I think that zoos should continue to exist. This is the solution I would recommend.

I think students should have new teachers each year. Why? There are a lot of reasons. I want to give you several example. It does not matter which grade you are in. You can be an elementary school pupil or a university student. If you have the same teacher every year you can not learn a different perspective. they can discover different things. Second, the same teacher does not establish an authority over them. Authority is essential for education. If the teacher has no authority over them, they can be reckless. In other words, they do not listen to the teacher. This situation is perilous. For example, if the teacher loses control over them he/ she cannot teach them anything. On the other hand, sometimes students face some risk if they have different teachers each year. The new teacher cannot be as good as the old teacher. Finally, the students should have a new teacher each year.

Video games are one of the most used entertainment media at the moment. They are loved by children, who use them more and more. However, people are divided about different points: some believe that video games are dangerous for health. On the other hand, some state how video games are useful and may have positive effects. What is the right choice ? Are there any other strategies? Personally, I would argue that playing video games for many hours may involve issues such as bad headaches. It is confirmed by the fact that more and more children and teenagers wear glasses nowadays. Concerning some positive effects of these games, I believe they are improbable. It depends on the genre of game which we are playing. Many war games and action ones have been available for years and they are often requested by children rather than adults or teenagers. It would be a problem from an educational point of view. A child who has played this kind of game could show aggressive behaviour with respect to one who has not played it. I think that children have to read books and be outdoors with other ones as well. It will be much more beautiful than staying at home. I hope their parents will make the right choice for their children.

Nowadays, our society teaches us to chase wealth, but is it really the key to happiness? Personally, I believe that keeping good health is more valuable than living in luxury. First of all, unless we are healthy, we cannot make the most of our life and never achieve our full potential. Therefore, we should take better care of the aspects of our health that are in our control, such as exercise, food, and sleep. But, in order to have a healthy lifestyle, we do need enough money to cover our basic needs. Although it's stressful when we are worried about having little money, a huge amount of it won't make us happier. For example, studies of lottery winners show that after a relatively short period of time, they are no happier than they were before their win. On the other hand, for a healthy body and mind it is essential that we do as much physical activity as possible. But, the rich are supposed to have their luxury houses cleaned and their fancy cars repaired. As a result, they do less exercise than is required. In conclusion, I hold the opinion that health is the most important treasure in our life.

My holidays in Norway: My grandparents and I (at the age of eleven) went on a trip to Norway to visit my aunt during the Easter holidays. This was a very special trip for me, as it was the first time I travelled without parents or siblings. We went by plane, taking off from the airport of Frankfurt and arriving in the capital of Norway, Oslo. I do not remember a lot about the journey; however I bared in my mind the picturesque view of the Norwegian landscape, which I could perceive from the window, shortly before arriving. Having arrived, I became tremendously tired and fell asleep immediately. As I woke up I thought that I had slept the whole night, but my aunt later told me that I had only slept two hours and that it is moring- but evening - dawn. After that, my aunt and her husband fried some patties with vegetables and rice, which was the first dish I had on Norwegian soil.

It's unfortunate that some doctors will only work in hospitals where they earn a lot of money. I think I know the reason why. A lot of young people want to become a doctor. When they have good grades they go to medical school and study for years. The workload during the medical school is heavy. This is the reason why most medical students don't have a side job. Because of this, students borrow money from the government. Because medical school is a long trial it takes years before they can pay back their loan. I think there is a reason how this problem can be solved. During medical school there are internships. Currently, students don't get paid during their internship. If hospitals pay these young doctors, they won't have to borrow from the government anymore. This way, when they're studying, they don't have to work hard to get their loan paid off.

In my opinion, you will be able to study anything for free. Because now, if you would like a good education you need to pay a lot of money for that, or if you would like a good school you need to travel for this. But of course, you can do this now, but it is very expensive in my opinion. I believe all of this will be a change for the good.

There are several studies about the influence of the work environment on employees' productivity In most companies there is an open space where employees have their own desks. They can talk to each other, discuss something but also hear each other on the phone. Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages about an open office. The advantages are that employees can see each other. They can see right away if you are available for questions or you're busy. Most of the time, an open office also has a nice ambiance. However, there are some disadvantages. Most of the time it is quite noisy. Different kinds of people are talking, to each other and on the phone. It's also not possible to discuss something in private. On the contrary, there are companies who work with cubicles. This can be good for the productivity of the employees. However, most employees experience this as lonely. They like to talk to their colleagues. Talking to colleagues motivates employees. To conclude, I think working in cubicles is productive for a few hours. For the long term I would recommend a more open design.

Almost everyone remembers the holiday season as a fun period, making new friends and having the time of their lives. I agree with that association wholeheartedly. When it comes to describing my best holiday ever, one specific trip pops up in my head. It was two years ago. I was 18 and it was one of my first holidays with my friends. We went to Bulgaria as a group of 6 friends. Three of them were my best buddies, and there were 2 girls as well. We were having a great time there. We had a hotel within walking distance of the sea, and there was that marvellous Vietnamese restaurant on the way. We were making a stop there very often. But it was not only my best holiday due to the different types of entertainment. During that trip, I got into a relationship with my old friend, Marta. That atmosphere of holiday easiness surely made it easier. That was my best trip, and holiday as well, ever. I found the love of my life, the one that I'm engaged to now. We all have great memories from there.

University represents a special moment in the life of a student. Their career and their future job depend on this kind of preparation. At that moment, students can decide to go away to study or live at home with their parents. These two possibilities have advantages and drawbacks. Firstly, one advantage might be, for example, being very close to the faculty. It will not be necessary to use transport but it is possible to go there on foot or by riding a bike. Moreover, another advantage is to stay on your own without being stressed by old daily issues. Therefore, you might get more relaxed, paying attention to your studies and activities. In addition to it, you can meet new people and make new friends at the university. What a stunning experience! However, there are some drawbacks. For instance, your habits will change drastically: you will have to organize your routine differently, doing housework and cooking for yourself. In this sense, everything you have neglected up to now. It is time to roll up your sleeves! In spite of these difficulties, university life is an incredible experience. In my opinion, I would prefer to live on my own rather than staying at home with my family.

However, education plays a crucial role in this modern era, and the media have a lot of influence on people's lives. For the last two decades, people's way of watching television has been changing. They prefer to watch television to acquire knowledge. First, obtaining knowledge through television would be a good way to help those people who have no time to go to school or live in the suburbs. In order to popularize education on television, they present more and more programmes about learning. For instance, when I was a child I used to watch a lot of television and there were many phonics songs from which I learned many basic things and also good manners. Moreover, television is preferred by every age group. It provides us with lot of information. There are many channels, such as National Geographic and Discovery Channel, through which we get to know about nature more specifically and can know how to survive in wild nature. There are many cookery shows from which I learn to cook delicious meals at home. I believe television has the potential to educate us, furthermore, the internet is an excellent way to get education. We get to control when we learn and what we learn about.

I think all students should have to study music because of all the advantages and benefits it brings about. Besides studying music is a great opportunity to develop skills and qualities in students. First of all I want to drive home some of the benefits of learning to play a musical instrument. The first one is the development of creativity and use of the left hemisphere of the brain of students. As a consequence they can have success in other activities at school. Also, according to an experiment, music has so many benefits for the health of people. It is proved that music makes people feel more relaxed and more aware of their lives. As a result they can enjoy those little things in life. Besides it is argued that those people who play an instrument or study music surprisingly have lower levels of stress in their lives as well as feeling happier owing to the release of hormones in the body such as serotonin and dopamine. Apart from that, conforming to some psychologists, playing piano, guitar or cello serves as therapy for children in order to foster the key elements of emotional intelligence which are self - esteem, social skills, motivation, empathy and self - regulation. The last one refers to the ability to manage emotions. As a result studying music represents a way of expressing ideas and feelings which contributes to improve emotional intelligence in students. Furthermore, when students learn to play an instrument and study music, they can communicate with other people no matter from where they come, because music is a universal language which can unite people. On the other hand, there are so many people who don't have the opportunity to study music or learn to play a musical instrument like piano, guitar, violin or ukelele, even when they desire it and they dream about it, so if schools can teach them about music and how to play a musical instrument this can be a chance for the students to dedicate their lives to music and in the future they could likely be excellent and renowned artists. Finally, I would like to say that learning to play a musical instrument and studying music are not only two ways to promote the creativity and art in the students but also music is a way to share feelings and thoughts, a way to connect with many people from different places with different languages.

In the future, perhaps I will be very old, but my school will be newer and more modern than now. I think it will have many big and high buildings replacing the little and short structures we have at the moment. And the number of classrooms will be higher than now. Everyone is likely to see an impressive gate with the school's name, which is written by me, who was an old student and became a famous artist. And I guess that the trees in the school garden will be very tall and with more branches, so the atmosphere will probably be comfortable and cool. But I think there are the things that won't change, which is my school uniform, which is a white shirt mixed with a blue skirt for girls or blue trouble for boys and especially thera are the black tie for boys, and especially there is the black tie for everyone. And another thing that I think will be retained is the studiousness of students and the dedication of teachers in my school. I also think that the school will become the best school in my city at that time. I am certain of that and I am proud of it.

My favorite film My favorite film is The Lord of the Rings. The main story is about Frodo's journey. A young hobbit known as Frodo has been thrown into a fantastic adventure when he is appointed to destroy the One Ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron. He is assigned three warriors, including Gandalf, Aragorn, and Boromir. But it's not going to be an easy journey for the Fellowship of the Ring, on the ultimate quest to rid the Middle-earth of all evil. The story is really unique, and so is the film. If someone wants to watch a nice fantasy adventure movie, I would like to recommend it.

A few weeks ago I started to use Write and Improve. The website focuses on improving English writing skills. The main feature is that it examines your writing directly. The computer gives feedback on several aspects. For example, if you wrote enough about the topic and how you could improve incorrect words. With yellow markings it says where you need to improve. For me the usage of this website is very helpful. I started two weeks ago and have already improved my writing skills. After each essay you write, the computer tells you on what level you are. This way, you can track your own growth. I need to achieve the level of Advanced English, so for me the notification on which level you are is the thing I like the most. However, I also like the diverse subjects you can choose to write about. On the other hand, there is one thing I'm not so positive about. Sometimes the computer says you need to improve a sentence. But, it doesn't tell where or how. I found this very difficult. Overall, I do like the website and does help you improve your English writing skills. Therefore, I would recommend this website to everyone who wants to achieve an English Certificate. Recommendation

Studying abroad has became very popular among students in Europe. Results of a survey conducted by Cambridge University show that the experience of most of the student who went abroad is positive. But, are there really no disadvantages? Firstly, I will discuss the pros of studying abroad. For sure, students who decide to study in another country are able to experience living in a different culture. It may open them up to new points of view. Secondly, students who are usually not wealthy can visit new places and not pay huge amounts of money for that. They can also make new friendships with people with whom they wouldn't normally meet. But, for some students, it may be very difficult to find in a new environment. For example, it would be hard to adapt for Iranian citizen in some of Western Europe's big cities. Another thing is that the level of education is very different between European countries. So, for some students it is better to stay in their country, where this level is comparably high. To summarize, I believe that studying abroad is beneficial for students. They should apply to go abroad if they have a chance.

To start with, most of the time it's not a good idea to tell a lie. However, at some moments it's better to live in a lie. In the Netherlands we have a holiday called Sinterklaar. Each year on December 5th, an old man visits the Netherlands. He gives children a gift and sprinkles with treats. However, the old man doesn't really exist. It's parents who rent a man in a costume and buy the presents. Children live in this lie. Anyway, the lie brings joy. It makes people believe in something, something exciting. On holidays like Sinterklaas it's fine to tell a lie. However, in most other scenarios, it isn't okay. For example, it's not okay when young adults lie to their parents about where they're going. In addition, it's also not fair to lie to your partner. When people tell a lie, they don't consider the consequences. When people find out the truth, knowing they were lied to will upset them. It isn't a nice feeling knowing someone is lying to you. Take as an example, when your partner is secretly talking to another woman. You often find him on his phone. Ask him about it. Do you want him to tell the truth or do you want to live in a lie and find out later? I think you know the answer. My advice about telling a lie: think about the other's feeling. Would they become happy not knowing or is it better to tell them?

I strongly believe that having several teachers is better than having one teacher for several years. In ancient times, a lot of people went to one tutor to learn a lot of subjects. That was good enough for them because there were not many subjects. However there are cons to that because one person could not be an expert in all subjects. There are a lot of limitations to that as those people would learn only what their tutor knows. Nowadays, most universities have more than one tutor to teach and train the students. Students would have different experiences and knowledge for they have many professors. Some universities have even more than one professor for a single subject so that they can concentrate on specific parts to be more proficient in that area. In conclusion, students nowadays can be better than their teachers because they can learn different skills from their respective teachers.

I absolutely agree with this decision. Around the world young people are making their future and their health is one of the most important problems. I noticed healthy health of the young people but in my mean it is not just physical health but also it contains the soul and mental health. For that reason I emphasise sport. The majority of students at universities are 18-25 . This circle is the most important time of everyone's life. Students at universities are teaching but I think studying is one of the parts of their responsibilities . They have to improve other abilities because in real life when they graduate they will enter the real world and probably they will have to face some problems. So I emphasize sport because sport makes a person strong and it can decrease her/his stress. When universities force them to do sport it is just for students because the lifestyle of almost all of them is inactive. They pass most of their time in front of computers . Their movement and activity are in a minimal degree. Unfortunately technology and science have prepared an easy life for us but they come down our activities. Some people need to force them to do something . In my opinion, sport can act like a inspiring thing and it can reassure students that are in some difficulties in their life. Today's metropolises have complexed with huge difficulties that directly affect our lifestyle. Modern life is not good in all aspects. It makes warn people about the bad affects of the wavy sea. I think we can see the reflection of sport in facing hazardous positions . Athletes are stronger and anxious. In the end, I believe that sport for young people is like water for trees.

There are pros and cons if it comes to having the same teacher for a longer time or having different teachers. Most of all, the most significant thing is to find a good teacher with an appropriate approach and effective learning methods which work in our case. If you find someone like that you should stick to this person because it doesn't happen too often. All of us have a mixture of traits and our personalities mainly differ from each other. This is what makes us feel good or bad when interacting with others in a special way. Instructors are those who trigger extreme feelings in learners; they can either attract or repulse. So when you run into someone who does not posses the qualities which are compatible with your own it can be a disaster. It is not only the main factor which can discourage you from a subject, but also make you discontented with your life overall. So dealing with a variety of instructors gives you a chance to meet the right person for you. On the other hand, when you have this special person, who helps you thrive and expand your knowledge in a pleasant way and is passionate about the subject, you should not let such a person go. Somebody like that is a rarity. So, as far as I am concerned it is advantageous to change a teacher whenever you do not feel totally comfortable as a pupil or if your progress is not visible in the long term.

Some people claim that exercise and staying fit is the most important thing in our lives. Is this really true? Or maybe we are exaggerating its importance? I will try to answer these questions in the essay below. There are plenty of benefits of exercising. First of all, being in shape has a positive effect on both mental and physical health. Results of the research conducted by Cambridge University clearly show that even twenty minutes of walking can prevent some serious diseases. Secondly, sports may become your new hobby. It's always better than staying at home and playing computer games. Moreover, you can meet new people if you start playing team sports like football or basketball. Are there more important things in our lives than exercising? Of course there are. I can easily think of several. For example, providing money for your family, finding true love, or staying in touch with your friends. However, in my opinion finding 30 minutes a day to run or exercise with YouTube videos is not a big problem, and the benefits are undeniable.

Today, our modern world is coming face to face with a hazard. What is it? Video games. Are video games a danger or not? What is my opinion? What do l think? I believe that this is not just my opinion, it is a problem for the whole world. Why? Why are video games a problem. Video games are trouble because children are playing games from approximately five to ten hours each day. Sometimes children sleep in front of the game. They fight their families to play video games. Moreover, they slam the door in their mother's or father's face when they don't agree. They do not go to school or eat something. Yes, video games are detrimental for children. However, they have some upsides when children check themselves. For example, video games improve our perceptions and develop our mind. But we must be careful with them. Consequently, much as video games have some profit we can lose command over children therefore we must be careful.

Music is considered in several ways by people. There are many different considerations about it. Some believe that music is important in our life and, in addition to this, it has a healthy effect on our body. Some scientific studies stated that music may be a useful strategy and therapy from a medical point of view. It is helpful in surgeries and over. By the way, just some weeks ago this experiment was made by a surgeon in a famous American hospital. He played a piano while he was getting on with surgery! What an incredible experience! Probably, this medical approach will be adopted by several hospitals in the world. Music is very often associated to something done in leisure time. However, there are many schools in which music lessons are taught. In particular, students will learn to play musical instruments and more. In fact, they will study the history of music, its origins and the most relevant musicians of the past. It is very important because whatever it is known up to now is basically related to these artists. However, there is someone who believes that music and music schools are not so important for our society. In this sense, many schools prefer to not teach music and other subjects as well. Furthermore, music is defined as a simple pastime, useless. In my personal opinion, I believe that music is important and it should be taught in every school. Music is a universal language, which links us to each other. The world is 'coloured', cheerful and awesome with it. Otherwise, we would live in a grey and sad world.

Nowadays, most of the population lives in cities, either small or big ones, and due to that, villages and towns are starting to disappear, which leads to several problems such as the lack of medical services. Firstly, it has been asserted that medicine is one of the most selected and better rewarded jobs, and it is important to take into consideration that this career can only be studied in a city, so that is the prime reason why most medical doctors choose to live in a city rather than a town. Furthermore, salaries are a crucial issue to have in mind when talking about that problem, since it is well known that city jobs are way better paid than small-town jobs. Although it is a severe problem, it seems that no solutions are given by governments or town councils when some of them could be as simple as raising salaries and offering more advantages to people specialised in medicine, so they can find it convenient moving from a city to a town. Besides, if that problem was more shown and stressed by the governments or social media, it would spread more, and more people would know about it, instead of ignoring it like most of them do. In conclusion, the lack of medical service in towns is an important problem to tackle since people in towns need medical assistance as much as cities do, and with a little concern and solidarity, it could be very easy to solve.

Hi Josh, Thank you for your last letter. How are you? I hope you're well. As you know, last year we couldn't participate in any music event due to the global pandemic. Fortunately, we were all vaccinated in January and everything has been going back to normal. That's why yesterday I decided to go to a Madonna concert. I am a big fan of hers and I always wanted to see her live. The tickets were absurdly expensive, but it was a good value for money - she was brilliant. Unfortunately, during the concert a guy insulted my girlfriend and I had to fight with him. Don't worry, I'm all right. The doctor said that I will be able to leave the hospital in a few weeks' time. So, we'll see each other at your birthday party! See you soon. Kenny

Being a doctor is an extremely prestigious and recognizable career but there is not an easy way to achieve this. Someone who is really interested in a subject needs to be ready to sacrifice a part of their youth to study and memorize difficult definitions. So after graduation and some years of placement a new doctor would like to find a place to thrive and to gain vast experience. In this career you are supposed to acquire sufficient training and extensive knowledge, so to have a high opinion. It is crucial and necessary to become popular with patients. It is known that small hospitals in little towns aren't as well subsidised as in big cities and as a result they end up being poorly equipped. So hardly any ambitious doctor would like to decide to work in a place like that. Cities give far better opportunities to achieve a remarkable success in your job in healthcare. A huge hospital with highly qualified staff, modern, even ground-breaking tools and advanced devices gives a chance to improve your skills and broaden horizons as a professional doctor. Among experienced, adroit colleagues you can improve your medical abilities. There are some changes which if implemented would improve the situation. The qualified doctors could be encouraged to support small hospitals when they were given decent earnings. Moreover were they given a chance to perform their job by using modern equipment, they would welcome a job, no matter the place.

Office designs play a huge role in the company culture. The type of layout can dictate your employee's satisfaction level, attitude and organisation. Although open offices are believed to encourage better communication and teamwork, offices with cubicles have their own individual working areas which provide privacy for the employees. I think closed offices are better in the workplace rather than open offices. To embark on, usually employees work in the same room, often beside each other, while seated along an enormous desk or on workstations positioned close together. Firstly, open offices are cost-friendly when it comes to financial aspects, it is without a doubt that an open office layout is much cheaper and practical compared to a closed office. For instance, companies don't need to buy a lot of furniture. Moreover, an open office keeps people accountable and productive, as there is a motivating force in knowing that anyone can see what you're doing. Open office naysayers argue that with all eyes on you, you are less likely to interact with your colleagues. On the other hand, segmented private offices are the best if you want privacy among your employees. Cabins are better for working productively because they would prevent too much noise. For instance, if you have employees working on tasks that require concentration and quiet space, then private panels are the best option. Furthermore, employees can also personalize their cubicles by hanging family photos or memorabilia that will inspire them to work better. Closed cabin offices are better used for companies with jobs that require quiet working areas such as law firms, accounting agencies, and other businesses in the financial sector. To conclude, I believe the best solution is to create cubicles. Unlike open offices, closed offices help minimise distraction allowing employees to work better and produce quality results.

Although there are many doctors who serve in rural areas, most doctors prefer working in cities for some reasons. I will explore those of them which deserve some comments here and make some suggestions. First and foremost, doctor's choices concerning working places depend on certain criteria such as financial and social ones. Thus, to select where to work is a normal process for not only for doctors but also for other professionals. Needless to say, everybody has a right to make a choice in order to have a better life. Secondly, based on recent statistics, almost everyone would rather have jobs in which they can make good money. For instance, I was introduced to a girl who had not earned well And then, she decided to change her life and jumped to another well-paid job. Now she smiles and enjoys life much more than the past. Money is not everything but it is something which is important. Thirdly, job vacancies at medical services in rural areas should be controlled by the government. That's to say, national authorities cannot disregard the situations about health services there. Being healthy is of vital importance. In a nutshell, providing that the problem of unfound doctors in rural areas can be solved by the authorities, citizens who fall in there have an opportunity to go to doctors when in need.

My favorite season of the year is spring. Summer is too hot for me and autumn is too cold and windy. I would like winter - even though it is cold - if there was at least some snow.

Everything wakes and starts to grow - the nature turns green again. Everything is fresh and new. I think the weather is perfect and it is special to me because it is a great change after the cold winter and the hot summer. It is the perfect time for long walks in the forest.

To get high quality education is important for all children. Because education is the only key to get them out of poverty and to build a strong nation and country. For those reasons, people like to study at a good university to get the best jobs after graduating from the university. There is no high quality university in my country because my country is poor. For those reasons, to study abroad is common in our country for rich people. There are advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. It will cost around 3000 dollars per year to study abroad. You will feel homesick sometimes. But after graduating from a foreign university your life is almost secure because the demand for those who hold a foreign degree is very high in my country.

Banning the use of mobile phones is a good idea but is not a good idea in every place. The council is thinking about three places, but each of them must be considered separately. The most important use of mobile phones is in times of need, so banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants cannot be a comprehensive law because sometimes we need to use a mobile phone. Sometimes people call us and we must answer them and sometimes, vice versa, we must call other people. Therefore, this banning is not a good idea, it can be changed in such a way that there is a limited time for the use of mobile phones in these places. The ban e. g. could be for one minute, not more. But this time may vary from place to place. On public transport, because people are crowded together, so the ban could be for one minute. In shops, the ban may be less than 3 minutes and in restaurants, the ban may be less than 5 minutes. Of course, we have to ask the opinion of those who are responsible in these cases with a poll for people who use public transport. After that, consider the result of the poll and make a decision what is the best approach to do that.

Personally, I think the best choice for students is to move away and live on their own while they are attending university because this has so many benefits and a student can learn about life even more. First of all, I think this is a better option because of the advantages it brings with it, so I drive home saying that one advantage of living on their own is that they have the chance to not only be more independent but also develop their time management and organization skills, because they have to be in charge of the payments of the rent, do their laundry, buy pantry, save time to prepare their food and do all the other stuff at the same time as they do well in the university. Apart from that, some students can live in a house, residence or apartment with other students so they can make good friends and foster their social skills. Owing to living with other people, there would be good and not really great moments which implies that it is necessary to have respect, learn how to solve conflicts, how to express differences but without damaging someone. Moreover, students can go through different experiences which will help them to grow personally, such as they would be more responsible and mature because there are also challenges of living alone, such as in the first days they probably are going to run out of milk or paper and nobody is going to buy them while they are studying, so they have to be more organized, have schedules and take decisions every day. prioritizing things over others. On the other hand, moving away from home sometimes is the best decision because many students live far away from the university which means they have to commute long distances in order to arrive on time to class, which can be tiresome after a certain period of time, so, bearing this in mind, living near the university can be perfect for these students and represents an opportunity to have more time for their subjects. Nonetheless, this choice can bring out the best in the students. It also can bring out the worst in them, because living on your own requires effort and compromise to take care of yourself and accomplish your goals. To sum up, living on your own has benefits, learning and challenges but it is a great experience and means a chance to prepare yourself for the near future. Finally, I would say that I support this decision but everyone has the right to decide and evaluate which is the best option for her.

If we talk about advantages, experiencing new things is always positive. Being in a foreign country expands your horizons and makes you an interesting person. Everything you learn studying abroad will make your resume look good. Your future employers will know that you are open to different cultures and have the ability to be independent. Being in another country takes you out of your comfort zone, gives you the opportunity to create a social network around the world, and also the ability to learn new things about yourself. But also you can feel a lot of nostalgia for home and if you are close to your family, they will miss you! You may experience cultural barriers with language, for example, having trouble opening a bank account, or going to the doctor, or attending a domestic emergency at home. There are high costs. It is often the case that tuition fees are higher for international students. Or if you have personal issues and need to return home early, you will spend more money than planned.

It depends. If you study foreign languages, you should travel to a country where you can practise this language. For example, you may travel to Ireland to improve your English level. You will work as an au pair or as a waitress in a restaurant. You will be able to live in a house with native people and you would talk in English every day. However, this way to practise supposes you must leave your house. You need to find an exchange family. You don't know anything about this family and your stay there may be very bad. If I decide to study abroad, I prefer to live in a rented house. Another disadvantage is if you have a wife and some children. You need to find a house for your family and for you. In my opinion, in this case it would be more difficult. You must be very clear about what your personal situation is and what you can do. You can lose lot of time if you a mistake.

From my perspective, health is more important than wealth. As we all know, if we are rich, we can buy anything and enjoy everything we want, but I think that health is more imperative than wealth. Do you know why? This is because in order to have fun or to enjoy our happiness, the first thing we need to have is a healthy body. When we are sick, we do not have energy to carry out activities in daily life. Consequently, we are unable to enjoy everything even if we are rich . A person with a healthy body can live a longer life compared to a person who is rich but not healthy. Money cannot buy a new life, precious time, or a healthy body. On the other hand, a healthy body enables us to have a longer life and it enables us to spend more time with our beloved family and friends. If we are healthy , we will feel happier and more cheerful. As we all know, nobody likes to get sick and no one likes to suffer from different kinds of illnesses. For example, coughing, fever, and getting a cold. We all know that getting sick makes us feel uncomfortable and we have no energy to carry out our daily activities. Thus, what for even if we are rich? As we cannot do anything if we are sick. In conclusion, I totally agree that health is more essential than wealth.

Last week, I went to Da Nang city which is one of the most livable cities in Vietnam. Da Nang is located in the centre of Vietnam. It was the first time I had ever been there. My first impression of the city was that it was so peaceful. The pollution is far less than in Saigon so that streets are not crowded and people are not in a hurry like the people in Saigon. The atmosphere is very comfortable as there isn't much carbon emission and the temperature is approximately 20 degrees Celsius. This atmosphere reminded me of Dalat city, which is also my favorite destination. The scenery of Da Nang is so beautiful because it is a coastal city. Visitors can enjoy both sea views and mountain views. On the first morning in Da Nang, I walked outdoors along the beach and enjoyed the breath-taking view there. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Around Dang Nang city, there are many tourist attractions which are famous, not only in the nation but also well known worldwide. I spent one day visiting Ba Na Hill, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Da Nang. I really enjoyed the spectacular scenery there and took a lot of pictures. I wish I could have stayed there longer.

Today medical doctors want to stay in cities not just for the money they can get. Essential facilities and medicines are not available in rural areas. It can be stressful saving lives if you don't have the basic elements to do it. Another reason is because of their families, in cities they can provide better standard of life and access a better education system for their kids and for themselves. It is important for a medical doctor to update their knowledge constantly and in rural areas that's hard. How can we solve the lack of medical doctors in rural areas? Improve life and work in rural hospital for medical doctors. Ensure specialization places in universities for medical doctors who have served in rural areas for at least two years. It is also necessary to invest in rural hospitals, modernize medical equipment and ensure supplies of medicine so they can do their job without problems.

Health is an important aspect of our life. There is a popular saying that " health is wealth." For a joyful life, it's necessary to be healthier. In today's world everyone is busy in virtual reality that never ends. There are social media apps, games, dating apps and all these virtual things rapidly replace the physical connection. Before this technological revolution, people met each other or they talked for hours and spent quality time but now social apps have replaced that completely. People are more interested in virtual instead of physical meetings and due to this, the emotional connection between people is not developing. There are many side effects of this in the long term, people feel alone and in the end depression is the thing that they get. People are more interested in playing mobile or PC gaming instead of playing real games on the ground. With the growing technological era, companies create fantasy games that people can't play in their real life but due to this they are losing their physical activity. Sitting for hours at a table is not a good thing for our body. Everyone's body needs some physical activity. But in the absence of physical activity, people get fat or gain weight and after that they face problems in their daily lives. So it's a good idea to force students to do physical activity. A man who is more physically active lives a longer and healthier life instead of those who avoid it. In today's sick world there are plenty of diseases that are ready to catch you if you compromise with your health. Due to an unhealthy life you will have to go to hospital and due to this you lose your money and time. So try to do some physical activity wherever you want. It will increase your life span and make you attractive.

Throughout the year, we experience four seasons: fall, winter, spring, and summer. Each season has its own taste and feelings, and different people prefer one season over the others. Like others, I have my favorite seasons and they are spring and fall. If I had to choose one, I would pick the fall season. This season always amazes me every year and I have had good experiences in it. First of all, the fall's weather is unique and differs from any other season. As it comes after the hot summer, the temperature starts dropping and it becomes enjoyable to go outdoors during the day without worrying about protection from the sun. Also, during fall, all trees change their color to beautiful shades of red, and their leaves fall on the sidewalks and streets creating a distinctive look that always comes to my mind when thinking of this season. In fact, it is a great opportunity to go for a hike and explore nature at that time of the year. Another thing that makes the fall my favorite period is that I can meet my friends and family after being away for a while. In summer, people usually travel to different locations. However, they come back at the beginning of fall to start their new semester, which is a great opportunity to get together to know about what they have done in their travels.

I would like to talk about a holiday that was really important to me. Two years ago, I went to visit my hometown with my family. That was the best holiday I ever had. I had left my hometown years ago. All my relatives were happy to see me because I am their only nephew. During my holiday, I visited so many places. Such as the central monastery, a school, and farms. I plowed on my grandfather's farms and cleaned the grasses from the fields. I felt so good being with my grandparents and siblings because they love me, take care of me, and keep me happy all the time. When I was there, I learned how to be kind to the people around you, value them, and take care of them when you can. Because we could not replace them with anything in the world. That is why that holiday was exceptional for me.

University students are considered to be adults. They can be in charge of their own lives nearly like adults, however, their main goal is full-time study, not yet a full-time job. Choosing places to live during their studies is one of the crucial decisions for them to make. For students who choose to stay at home, one of the reasons can be finances. Staying at home can save a lot of money on accommodation, food, bills etc. Moreover, it can also guarantee the safety of students and put their parents' minds at ease when they know that their children are in a safe place and in the most comfort. On the other hand, students who choose to stay on their own during their studies at the university can be more confident and be able to handle any obstacles that might be thrown at them during this time, money shortage, juggling study and a part-time job, taking care of their own basic needs such as food and clean clothes, to name a few. In conclusion, staying on my own while study at the university is the choice I would prefer. Because being on your own can teach you to be strong and ready for good and bad situations in the future once you enter the work cycle.

Hi Peter, I hope you're well. I'm just writing this letter to share my experience of the concert that I attended last week. What happened was that my good friend offered me a free concert ticket because he had been asked to travel to a client's location. Luckily, I was free on Saturday evening, and his brother was also going to the gig, so I wouldn't be alone and decided to attend the concert. While entering, I was totally amazed by the sound of the crowd, and I came to know that there was an up-and-coming singer and guitarist performing; I was blown away by how good he was. The band was known by the name Black Mamba, one of the role models for many Indians. The concert started at 7 p.m, but there was a support act first , so I had planned to arrive a little later as I wasn't interested in that. I was able to listen to the latest songs which hadn't been released yet in the market and, we danced the whole time to the beat. I hope to see you soon. Rahul

As technologies have improved since the last century, the world has changed. All the relationships involving countries have become closer and some changes were important to achieve this, such as determining a universal language to make connections wherever you were. Once English was chosen to be the universal language, learning it became more popular year by year. Then, finally we get to nowadays, a time where we know English is an important skill to get a job or just to make new friends on websites. If most people ask their parents what the importance of learning a new language is and later ask a friend who shares the same age this same question, they will probably find a big difference when comparing these answers. However, nowadays learning English (or another language) has become an essential skill to live better. Even if a second language were just to be used in a job, it will always be important for personal improvement to know more about our planet and the different cultures on it.

Many young people believe that migrating to study at university may benefit them while some of them like to be with their family for support and help in education. In my opinion, families are the supporting pillar for every student to achieve their goals and offer them a good environment to be successful in their life. To embark on, adolescents nowadays prefer to go far from their home because they think that it could lead them to the better career. They choose this way because they want to become independent and gain some experience facing difficulties throughout the process. However, they can suffer from homesickness. Furthermore, being away from family might result in following sexual or porn sites which destroy their life at the beginning. For instance, some students who do not have family to keep an eye on them have no fear of doing dreadful things. Their friends mislead them to commit some crime for their own benefits such as consuming drugs, or theft for the greed for luxurious things. On the other hand, students prefer to live with their family because they feel relaxed that their family is here with them whenever they need their support, whether it is financial or psychological. A family also protects their children to stay away from being misled. They not only provide educational support but also teach them good manners and how to interact with people, helping others and being aware of awful activities, to be successful in life. Although being alone throughout studies can make students mature enough to face life's troubles, being with family makes them feel that no one will help them in crises or risks. To sum up, staying away from the family provides the happiness of being independent; however staying with family gives great pleasure, to be relaxed and follow family advice to deal with any problems.

The kind of design that you chose is related your work . For example, if your job is a secretary it is better you work alone and your employees have a separate class but if you need to have more relation with other colleagues you should have a more open design with no walls. In smaller put I personally agree with an open design since all co - workers can see each other and I believe eye contact is a good motivator in the office. Imagine a manager or a banker . In an open design they can see their workers' manners and operations and it is easy to judge their abilities and confidences . I think an open design is like a mirror that reflects your actions and you have to be so strong to work in front of others . Another benefit of an open space is that you use your spaces better .

I agree with this type of requirement that students must complete some volunteer work in order to graduate. I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, students get a chance to communicate with many people by doing volunteer work; people whom they have less opportunity to.. Through cleaning work, they can communicate with local people and through devoting work, they can communicate with weak people. This is beneficial for students because they can understand many perspectives as well as broaden. Secondly, students get a chance to improve their action by doing volunteer work. It needs spontaneity. Students have to be active for others by themselves. This is beneficial for students because action is necessary to promote in the future. Lastly, students get a chance to improve their self-confidence by doing volunteer work as they are appreciated. This is beneficial for students because self-confidence leads their actions. In conclusion, I agree with the requirement that students must complete some volunteer work in order to graduate for those three reasons.

If need to choose one of them, I will select option No. 2. Why? Because life changes every day, so you need to adapt to that. The main issue here is the quality of the teacher, not the change. That means, if you have a good teacher and it's a mirror that you can learn and develop then there is no need to change the following year. The problem I should mention here is the student must have the right to select the teacher who will teach and support her / him during a learning period. NA,. a student is like a customer that pays for lessons, so they have their own power to select any factor that can impact them. Through that decision they create pressure that is put on the shoulder of the teacher, who then helps them to improve themselves to have more positive feedback from their student. Hence, the quality of education and learning can continue to increase.

These days studying in another country has become popular, but some people are not convinced about immigration. Others think it is for science. This article will discuss both sides and I will sketch my personal opinion. One of the advantages of traveling abroad for the sake of learning is, for example, when you want to travel you have learned the language of the region by talking to people. Then you can understand their customs and traditions. In addition, you must rely on yourself, for example, to become the person managing your money. And you learn something related to economics, which will be useful for you in the future. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages that a migrant faces in a different region. To be clear, when you travel to any country you do not know how to protect yourself from thieves, especially if you are a girl. In conclusion, after a careful analysis of my point of view, I believe that in life you should strive for your dream.

Currently it is a big issue in the health sector that most doctors do not want to continue their job in rural areas. There are two main reasons which I would like to explore in this writeup. Firstly, a lack of basic needs which are primary requirements of a doctor like education , availability of resources and infrastructure. If any person is a doctor then he thinks that he will offer a better education for his kids and a healthy competitive environment for the upbringing of his child. Meanwhile rural areas are failing to provide these basic services. Further to this , a doctor wants to live a luxurious life like in cities, which is not possible in villages. In the wake of automobile services or road transport, these services are not good in rural areas. Secondly , I would like to say a medical practitioner has to always learn for the betterment of his skills which he could well get in cities. In cities the number of doctors is greater and the surroundings are competitive where he could get more. In my opinion, to sort this burning issue, firstly governments should increase the basic amenities in rural area and provide all the facilities which are required to do well in villages.

You spend more than half your life at your work place. Hence the environment of a work place is very important, which affects your daily life and working efficiency. Some have their own mindset , some are cooperative and a few are self-centred. Due to this condition I believe an enclosed workstation is more useful. If you are doing work in an enclosed chamber, you could do your work more confidently because there is no chance of disturbance and failing by losing your work secrecy to a colleague. You could also make it your personal time zone when you have no office work. During this time if you have to stay in the office you could spend your time on learning as well as to improve your qualities . If you do work in an open design and any of your data or ideas are opened without your consent, then you feel unhappy and also not only the person who did this ill act but also your other colleagues are suspect, which changes the office environment to uneasy, unpleasant and it takes a sufficient time away from these situations.

We visited cities in Italy, Croatia, and France. We met local people and we ate local food. We walked a lot to see lots of monuments and landscapes. Although we were very tired, we were very happy.

The environment of work has changed a lot since this half of the century. The model of design for our desks are highly developed towards combining comfort as well as efficiency. Many companies are adopting the new open design. Generally the open spaces permit a huge interactivity between employees and allow everyone to work in efficient conditions. I prefer to work in an open space. There are many reasons behind this choice. First of all, it permits me to feel free and cool. It also allows me to be close to my colleagues. As I mentioned before, the open space not only seems to be very relevant but also it leads users to become creative and productive. In addition to these arguments, I believe deeply that open space will remain an efficient means in the perspective of following the requirements of respect for the environment and energy efficiency.

We certainly approve of the new way of learning. It's easier and faster than yesterday. Knowledge is in the hands of everyone. But is it enough? Second, computers and tablets cannot take the place of books. So, you should not close all the libraries around the world. Reading a book is a different experience than surfing on the Internet. You look up a word in a dictionary. You have a good time with a book. You seem to be concentrating more with a book. So, is it the end of the book?

To keep students occupied by useful activities is usually a great challenge for teachers. In the past, reading a book or doing some ordinary activities were enough for children to enjoy but now it's very difficult to satisfy them. Studying music has become, through the years, a relevant and innovative activity that leads students to increase their skills and capacities. In some rare cases, some "ignorant" schools don’t allow children to follow a musical learning session. It is, in my modest opinion, a huge mistake considering the importance of music. Playing music provides students with many faculties that they need like an open mind, connection with other friends or self-esteem feelings. Many schools aren’t conscious about the importance of music in enhancing the student’s behavior and therefore giving them a solid protection against violence or drugs. I continue to believe strongly that music is very important for students not only in schools but also in life.

If you eat healthy food and you do exercise every day, you could be healthy. This issue is the most important reason to be fit. People who do exercise and eat well are in better health than people who don't do it. On the other hand, I think there are things which are as important as health. In my opinion, it is very important to have a family and have good friends. If you live alone and you don't meet with other people, you may be very sad, and you will have health problems.

For example, when I switch on the TV, it always has war or love on it, we couldn't improve in this way. < u0130. If we want to do research, we can use a computer or we can use books.

I think all students should study music and learn to play a musical instrument. I have three reasons to support my opinions. Firstly, we have a sense of hearing, which is one of our five senses. Why don't we improve this potential skill? Listening to a lot of music, we can improve it easily and understand this world more. Secondly, we can broaden our world by playing a musical instrument at school. It is difficult to touch or play many kinds of them in our daily life because of fewer opportunities. But there are many and we can play them for free! Why don't we take the precious chance to play musical instruments? We may start our career as professional musicians with the opportunities. Thirdly, this world is full of music. Music is everywhere. There is a lot of seasonal music or events related to music and so on. Even if we know little about music, we can enjoy our life more. With these three reasons, I agree that students should study music and musical instruments.

I think nothing will be the same in the future. Probably, people will like travelling in the same way as nowadays, but we'll use different transport. Yesterday, I read a news article about when we will start to travel to the moon. A few years ago, nobody thought we could make a trip there. Although it is possible at this moment, it is very expensive. I'm sure that my sons will watch the first trip to the moon before they die. Today, people are buying electric cars. In 2050 cars will be able to fly without wheels. Planes will fly faster than planes are flying today. In my opinion, transport will be faster and create less pollution. I think maybe we will have a problem: will we have enough money to make a trip? Perhaps people won't travel because there will be more poverty around the world. In fact, that is an important question for a globalization in the next fifty years.

Hi Aizen, Sorry for not having written to you recently. I'm swamped, so I forgot. Hey Aizen, have you ever watched Bleach? The film is about a group of classmates trying to help people around the world. In the beginning, the people around them think they are crazy. But gradually, they change their minds and recognize them. During their adventure, there are meaningful stories about people, the environment, etc. That's the point that makes me love it. And you should watch it. Trust me, it won't waste your time. Well, I have to go now. I'll write to you later. Your friend, Phuc

I think the use of technology has become popular these days, so some people think that we should rely on technology for everything, while others believe that they should rely on themselves. This article will discuss both aspects and present my personal conclusion. On the one hand, they think that they are getting used to technology, for example, when you visit these people you will find many machines, such as heating appliances for eating, clothes, and dishes. In addition, do not forget the garden equipment and massages. On the other hand, some societies disagree on this point. To clarify this, people in South Africa and America prefer to work in agriculture or education, without using any technical means. Because these people believe that God created people to work for themselves. In conclusion, after carefully analyzing both points of view, I believe that we must constantly read books in order to progress.

Why do I learn English? Is English necessary for me? Well, they are the questions I asked myself many times before. At first, I thought that I was wasting my time with this thing. But now, I know the reasons why English is crucial to me. First of all, I'm learning IT. As you know, this major needs English very much. The references, related documents, ...

Volunteer work is really important, from a social point of view. Considering how many poor people are in the world, we cannot neglect the contribution made by volunteers. The biggest cities of the world (and not only) host several volunteer organizations and non-profit associations. Basically, the goal of these associations consists of providing food, a bed and whatever it is necessary. We have to be proud of them. Some high schools have a requirement: students will succeed in graduating only if they complete a certain amount of volunteer work. That is a good choice, by means of students are prepared to face the world and every kind of situation. Doing these social experiences, students are able to insert themselves in difficult social contexts and help unlucky people at the same time. Furthermore, volunteer work is just not this. There are several possible activities, which could be more or less suitable for each student. It depends on them, they have to choose carefully and cleverly. That is not a joke! In light of these considerations, I would conclude by stating that organizations and activities like these must be sustained and preserved. We have to start focusing a bit more on the others than on ourselves.

I am part of those who believe the quote saying: “If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.” Even if we live in a stressful and difficult life, I still think that telling the truth is the only way that can lead to reach a peaceful life. Our social environment is infected unhappily by this disease that is called "lies." Wherever you go, you meet a person who uses lies all the time they speak without feeling wrong. I think this bad behavior is the unavoidable result of lack of education within families or in school. When you have parents lying continuously, that leads their children to follow them in this behavior. Parents and teachers have the responsibility to educate children, not only by giving a good example, but also by explaining how much lying is dangerous for our community. Our children are living currently in a difficult environment where lies are the common behavior so it's hard for them to adopt a good way for their life. We should share with teenagers and the younger generation the benefits of telling the truth and lead them to increase their values and beliefs. Our laws also have to set new rules that punish those who use lies in their behavior. In addition, TV news programs could also broadcast a spot about this issue.

Currently, there are many people who prefer to use computers and tablets to study. Thick and heavy books are no longer used by students to study. Why do students choose to use computers and tablets to study instead of books? This is in light of the fact that many students think that using computers or tablets to study is more convenient than reading books. From my viewpoint , I think it is necessary to replace books with computers and tablets in schools and universities. This is because as a student, I think that bringing books to schools and universities is very inconvenient. Books are very thick and heavy. A newspaper article alleged that many students suffer from back pain and backbone deformation because they have to carry heavy and thick books to schools or universities every day. Thus, sooner or later they will suffer from these injuries. On the other hand, bringing a computer or a tablet to school is a lot more convenient and students do not need to bring a lot of school bags to school. They just need to bring one backpack to keep the computer or tablet. This is because of the fact that all documents can be stored on a computer or tablet. As we all know, a computer or a tablet will not be heavier than a stack of books. Besides, one of my reasons to agree that computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities is that when students need to search for some information, they do not need to flip through the pages. With a click of a finger, students are able to look up the information by using computers or tablets. Consequently, students are able to save some precious time and can reduce their strenuous study schedules because they have more free time. From my perspective, I truly think that using computers or tablets brings us a lot of perks and benefits. Furthermore, as a student, I think that students should get used to using computers or tablets when they are still in their teenage years, so that they know how to use computers when they are working in their adulthood. This is because currently most jobs are using computers or tablets instead of using a book. In addition, I also think that computers and tablets should replace books in schools and universities because we are able to save more trees as papers is made from the trunk of a tree.

Dear Town council president. First, I would like to congratulate you for your excellent work during your current mandate. No one can ignore your involvement and engagement. Our town is very proud to have a responsible like you, who pays attention to their citizens. I would like to thank you also for your good initiative that permits citizens to express their opinion in a free way. Concerning your new decision about banning the use of mobile phones in public transport, I would inform you that I totally agree with it. It is a wise decision that could be considered as an advanced form of citizenship. I highly appreciate this decision which will permit us to use public transport in a safe and efficient conditions. We suffered a lot from those who use their mobile phone in public transport . This bad behavior is annoying as well as disrespectful. This form of carelessness is behind many conflicts that lead innocent people to jail sometimes. Whether using mobile phones in transport or in shops, this behavior must be banned. As you know, digitalization is swallowing up our lives. We use technologies everywhere and it is unavoidably transforming our daily life. Our phone mobile addiction is just increasing more and more. To summarize my letter, I would like to encourage you to maintain this courageous decision. Everyone is ready to applaud this initiative.

Everybody should travel at least one time in their life. Most people have already done it. Concerning my own experience, I am going to write some lines about my best holiday ever. Two years ago, my friends and I booked a holiday which was going to last a week, three days in Praha and the other three in Budapest, Hungary. I admit we were very excited. Nothing went wrong, so we took off for Praha on the 10th of August. After that, we went to the hostel, in order to leave our luggage and start our adventure! Although we had few days, we lived them as well as we could by visiting many typical places of this fascinating city. We went to the Old Castle and we went into the historical centre, buying some souvenirs and taking many photos as memories. Then, we had lunch in a typical restaurant, where we could taste traditional dishes and drink a lot of beer! However, the best was still to come. This was when we went to the spa. What a beautiful day! Thanks to my friends, it was the best holiday ever. I will not forget it.

I don't agree with the first opinion. I think teachers should change each year. There are a lot of factors in this situation. Firstly, students need a different teacher's opinion and view. I think this is very important to improve children. If they see different kinds of opinions from their teacher, they can develop their thought system and another brain system. If they only have the same teacher for several years, it will never happen. Secondly, if students have the same teacher for several years, they can establish an emotional connection. This is a significant and dangerous part in my opinion. I think this connection should never exist between teachers and students because this type of emotional connection can be dangerous for teachers and students. Some teachers have different kinds of levels of experience, this is another significant point. Other teachers may be more experienced than some teachers. Consequently, teachers should change each year.

Hello everyone, Thank you for your effort. I guess that video games are negative games and may affect the health of children and youth very badly because of the bad design and the bad ideas which video games usually have. I'd like to discuss another issue. The biggest problem is that people use those tools and games for too long so that they lose their own beautiful life and they might lose their own future! I know many people who were successful at their school and were active family members. They have suddenly lost their success due to video games. They had to interrupt their apprenticeships or they had to change their amazing way of studying! I personally do not have any idea to prevent this huge problem. It might be a good suggestion to make video games prohibited for children and young people. Thank you.

I believe in an all-round personality development of students. For that reason, students should be engaged in extracurricular activities along with volunteer work. I feel this way for two reasons which I wish to explore in this writeup. Every student has to go into society. For that reason, he has to be ready for social liabilities like family responsibilities and job liabilities. Our day to day environment is getting harder to survive and competition is growing in every field hence students should be ready for all dynamics. Many universities are encouraging students to do volunteer work through different courses, like NCC and NSS, which groom the personality of student in every aspect, like physical, mental, spiritual and social parameters. Moral values are decaying in societies hence people are not interested in doing work that they don't get a salary for. In the wake of this scenario offering the course requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate, it would be beneficial not only for students but also societies to maintain the moral values of people.

I agree with the opinion that learning to speak a foreign language is important these days. I have three opinions to support the idea. First of all, speaking a foreign language expands the world we can join. Our work is not completed domestically these days. In particular, the population in Japan has been decreasing for several years. At the same time, more foreign people who want to get jobs in Japan are coming to Japan. Japanese people have had to work with foreign people recently. Also, it is severe to sell Japanese products only in Japan in this situation. Thus, Japanese companies should sell their products globally. If they can only use the Japanese language, they will lose the opportunities to get their products to be known in foreign countries. People in other countries are in the same situation. Therefore, an easy way to expand people's world is to enable them to speak multiple languages, which can increase their work efficiency. Secondly, we can earn a lot of money if we can speak more than one language. In Japan, English speakers can get a very well-paid job, and have a rich life. Many Japanese don't have the skill of speaking English. The CEFR level for speaking English for most Japanese is B1 or lower. If a Japanese person has more than a B2 or a higher speaking level, he can get a chance to work with people in foreign countries, and he can get a higher wage. In other countries, people who can speak a foreign language are the elite and able to obtain a high salary. Thirdly, learning to speak a foreign language may help the reading of a foreign document, and this skill lets us save a lot of time. From the technological side, most reports are written in English. Thus, we should read these foreign documents to interpret what is described. If we can read English smoothly, we will save some time, and we can do other things. If we are in a situation where we are dealing only with our mother tongue, we can only get limited information. Learning a foreign language is effective for us to save a lot of time to do many jobs. To sum up, speaking a foreign language such as English can expand our job capacities.

It goes without saying that living on your own is one of the most crucial decisions a person has to make in their life. Moving away while studying is increasingly claimed to be the correct decision. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would like to point out some of the advantages living on your own while studying has. No doubt, once you are at college, your life changes dramatically. Ever since then, you are not a teenager any longer and you are capable of making some important choices that have significant effects on your future. One of them could be to choose to live by yourself. To do so, it is undoubtedly needed to find a job which provides you with the economic resources necessary to afford your expenses, even if it is a part-time job. By undertaking a job, not only will you understand how hard life can be, but also you take on some crucial responsibilities such as working in a team or dealing with people. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned. Living by yourself means that you are the one who is responsible for the chores at home. As a result of working and taking care of the chores, you do not get round to studying as much time as you wish, and that could be negative for you in the way that your academic results can be worse than you expected them to be. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that had it not been for those drawbacks, living on your own while studying would be the perfect moment in your life for you to find out who you are, who you want to be, and where you belong.

In my opinion, university students should leave the family and live in a hostel. It would be better for their personality development . I feel this way for two reasons which I wish to explore in this essay . Firstly, I would like to say that personality grooming is very important at this age . As we know, if students live with their family, they could not get such exposure which is needed for later entering family life and professional life. Just after completing university life one enters professional and family life, which is not easy, and for that reason you need prior exposure and, from my point of view, independent university life teaches it well. Secondly, I would like to discuss the economic point of view. In the higher education system books are very costly and a student has to read many point as self study and for self study and for that reason he must have all the books but if you are living in a group you can share the books and study materials which are not available in the library. Further to this , as we know discussion and group study is essential for a better understanding of subjects.

Have you ever asked yourself: Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? From my personal standpoint, learning to speak a foreign language is still important, maybe even more. Why is that? Knowing foreign languages helps you in everything, such as travelling, communication, etc. You can easily find places, ask for directions, and even order food. Speaking a language gives you a better understanding of the country's culture. You can interact with people more freely which provides a greater scope of meeting new people, making new friends, and more fun and enjoyment. Next, language helps you in your work. Along with the world's development, companies' requirements are higher. Most companies look for candidates who have foreign language skills. If you are already working, knowing a foreign language gives you promotion opportunities. In a nutshell, at any given time, knowing one or many foreign languages is important. The more languages you know, the better life you will have.

Our life constantly changes over time and the future of travel will also proceed to a new level. But I don't think everything will be altered completely. I'm going to give you some demonstrations. Firstly, it will surely be a lot more modern, improved technology will give us a faster approach to travelling around the world. I believe that in the future, people don't need any travel agencies, they can do it themselves. Do you think that is the limit? I know it isn't. Most of us know that we as humans are capable of travelling into outer space, even if there is just a glimmer of hope. We can get to a broader range of our capacity of what is possible in travel. Imagination is crucial and time will prove it. As I mentioned at the outset, something will be changed but something still remains. They are the professional travellers. They are superior and really useful. I don't think people want them to disappear. We all use social media to research the travel destinations where we have never been to. We still need people as mentors who have practical experience to give us suggestions.

Dear town council, I realise that there is a proposal to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. As a part of the town, I think it's important to share my opinion. I think this is not a good idea. First of all, this will hinder the town's prolonged effort to attract tourists. This is because tourists from other towns will find this idea bothering and it will leave a bad impression on our town. Other that that, this will bring inconvenience to us who utilise the short period of time on public transport and in shops and restaurants to do important things like reading the newspaper or hearing a podcast. The amount of time wasted in the long run is huge. Some of us will also have important calls that need to be made immediately. I conceive that this proposal has been brought to consideration due to the increasing number of accidents due to phone usage on public transport and in long queues in restaurants and shops. For that reason, I would like to suggest a small immature suggestion that is to have a campaign to educate the residents to stop using phones excessively in not suitable places or times. I hope that the town council will put serious thoughts into this matter. The advice that I shared is my own opinion and I hope that it will contribute in this matter.

Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. People often get their trust by telling the truth to others. Telling the truth makes everyone believe in you and more people would like to be friends with you. As the saying goes, 'honesty is the best policy', people often believe that people who tell the truth have a good personality. However, there are some times when we are unable to tell the truth because sometimes telling the truth to someone might hurt their feelings, making them feel sad or might make them feel uncomfortable. Thus, as for me I think it is acceptable to tell a lie sometimes. From my perspective, I think that telling a white lie maybe will make people feel better or less worried. For example, most of the parents often tell white lies to their beloved children so that their children will not worry about them. Every parent in the universe does not want their children worried about them, they hope their children can live happily. On the other hand, there are also some people who really love and care about their parents. They will tell a white lie to their parents, telling their parents that they are living happily and no need to worry about them but in the reality they are actually not happy about everything in their life or they are unable to get what they want such as their jobs, their studies and their life. They just hope that their parents are happy and feel relieved that their children are doing well. Hence, I think sometimes it is acceptable to tell a lie. Furthermore, sometimes telling the truth to someone might make you lose your friends and might cause some quarrels. For instance, one of your friends tries to look pretty today so she wears heavy makeup which does not look good on her. Then you tell the truth to her and say that she is very ugly today. As a result, she will feel really upset and frustrated with you. Instead, you should tell her that she looks good with the makeup and then you can give her some suggestions about the makeup. Consequently, you will not only not lose a friend, your friend will also appreciate your help. Thus, once again I feel that telling a lie is acceptable sometimes.

Nowadays, people share the view that free time is vital for having great health because with it, your mind disconnects from work. However, I am going to tell you what I do in my free time if you are highly interested to follow my chill out routine. Firstly, it is crucial to say which activities I usually do in my free time or for chilling out. In fact, I often read a lot of books. As I read so many books, I could have a gratifying experience because as well as learning new things, I can imagine a lot of astonishing settings. In addition, I absolutely love listening to music. As I listen to a variety of types of music, it helps me to relieve my mind from work and also it improves my mood. Last but not least, the schedule of my activities should be mentioned if you are highly interested in keeping up with my daily routine. At first, I always start reading my books at 4:00 pm and overall, I do it at 5:00 pm. I do that in this moment because it is when I finish school and after that I need to chill out at once. On the other hand, I usually start listening to music at 9:00 pm until 10:00 pm as listening to music at this time helps me fall asleep at once. To conclude this essay, I believe that free time should have the same importance as other activities that we practise every day. As you have free time, you can cut down your levels of stress. So you must have free time even though you don't have enough time.

I'm looking forward to going abroad for a master's degree. I think there are a lot of advantages to studying abroad. Firstly, some foreign universities can provide better education conditions for a student. Particularly, Europe, the USA, and Canada's universities. I am always thinking about going to Canada for a master's. But first, I need to improve my English a lot. Another advantage is their people and conditions are different from my country. They have good living conditions and happiness. Who doesn't want to go to Canada? Even more so if you live in Turkey. Canada has a lot of national parks. You can visit whenever you want. Definitely, there are disadvantages of studying abroad. I think one of the hardest is adaptation. Because you come from a different country and culture. If you want to live there, you must adapt to it. You should learn about their culture and lifestyle. It can take time but you will get used to their lifestyle. Then, you will miss your family a lot surely. That's another difficult disadvantage. However, thanks to technologies it is easier at this time. Because you can video call them and see them every day. As a result, there are advantages and disadvantages, but if you live in Turkey, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

Last year, I went to Datça with my best friend and his family. It was a superb holiday. We had a car and we went wherever we wanted to go. We drank too much and talked about some significant subject. We generally talked about working life, religion, and the universe. We swam a lot and walked to lose weight. It was tiring but amusing. Datça was the best place for a holiday I've ever seen. Because there aren't too many people there, and it has beautiful views. I love it there. It has a clean and calm sea. If you want to swim there, it will be very pleasant. There is an island where you can go on foot. There are a lot of goats on this island. It was amusing to see and touch them. Then, we went to the center of Datca all night. Sometimes we sat in some cafe. We were there for a month. I enjoyed it very much. I want to go next year.

When I was child I loved playing video games. I remember when I exchanged my dog for a video game. It was a Nintendo 64. It came with a Mario game. At that time there was a place where you could rent some games. Usually, I rented some games on Friday. Well, playing video games is not so bad, it depends on what games you play. For example, several games are educational, but other games are very violent. So if you play a video game, but the game that you play is educational, I don't see any problem. But if you play some games that show our children violence, that show us violent behaviour, it might be a real problem for us, parents. Another example is cartoons. I have a cousin that watches Hulk a lot, but he shows some negative behaviour. He shouts at his mother and other people. So, it depends on which game he plays.

My favourite indoor activity is definitely to go to the gym. Unfortunately, that is currently not possible because of corona virus. I like the activity because you have so many devices in the gym and options to work out. The last time I went to the gym was two years ago. I miss it a lot, but I found other ways to exercise outside.

Everybody knows exercise is a significant thing to stay healthy. There are different factors like food and sleep, of course. Firstly, all people need to do exercise. If our body doesn't move sufficiently, it doesn't work smoothly. We shouldn't lie on the sofa all the time. Consequently, people need to do exercise 30 minutes daily. Secondly, food is another very important thing for our body. If we want to stay healthy, we should be careful about what we eat. We shouldn't eat too many hamburgers, chips, and other unhealthy foods. Our body needs healthy oils, a sufficient amount of vitamins, and minerals. If we don't take these beneficial things, our body doesn't work smoothly. We shouldn't eat at night because our bodies need to recover at night. Another significant thing to stay healthy is sleep. Every person needs quality sleep. If we didn't have a sufficient amount of sleep, we would be like a zombie. A normal person needs to sleep 8 hours daily. As a result, we should do these things. They are simple and feasible things to stay healthy.

Of course, something will change. It will be a massive change in travel. For instance, planes will be faster than now. We will arrive 1 or 2 hours later instead of 10 hours. They can stay longer in the sky and they won't need oil. What about trains? Trains will be faster than at present. We know trains are not very fast. They will be in the future. They will be longer and more powerful. They will pass through the cities. Trains are too loud in our times. In the future, they will be noiseless. What about cars? Everyone dreams of flying cars. In my opinion, it's not realistic. Cars won't be flying but will be smarter and more powerful. We won't need a driver in the future because cars will drive themselves. The percentage of car accidents will decrease, literally. People won't die because of car accidents. As a result, future travel seems attractive, safe, and fast.

Hi Jack, Happy Birthday, Jack . Sorry for the delay! In our country, we usually invite our beloved person and friends to celebrate and to attend the birthday party. The birthday party celebrations in our country are usually the same as in your country. After the meal we all clap our hands and sing " Happy Birthday to you" and we have a cake with candles. Then, the guests will give me birthday gifts and will pray for it to be a great day. We usually go to the monastery to donate money for monks and nuns. Be happy! Yoon

Nowadays, television is universally known as one of the most needed things in a human's life. What is the importance of having a television in our own house? Is television that important to us? If one day television vanished from our life, would we be able to 'survive'? Thus, let us take a look at the importance of television. First and foremost, television not only entertains us, it is also able to educate people of all ages, from the young ones to the old ones. Television creates a window upon the world for us to understand and explore more of the four corners of the world. For example, we can acknowledge the things that happen around us swiftly by watching television. We don't even need to travel around to get the latest news, we just need to sit on the couch and switch on the television to watch the latest news. Doesn't it sound very simple and convenient? From that, we are able to get educated by the news that is reported on television. Do you know why? This is because there are a lot of people who share their experience through television and we are able to learn some new stuff from their experience and avoid the same mistakes that they have made. As the saying goes, 'prevention is better than cure'. We can prevent ourselves from making the same mistakes that others have made. Thus, we are able to reduce the troubles and burdens in our life. Besides, we are able to learn other languages by watching television. For example, there are a lot of people who would like to learn the Korean language, so they watch Korean dramas on television. I think this is a quite useful way to learn other languages and be educated. Apart from that, I have seen many parents allowing their children to watch English movies on television. This is because children are able to develop their English language skills from a young age. From one of my experiences, my niece is able to speak fluent English at the age of five, I am astonished by her. After asking her mother, I knew that my niece actually started to watch English movies on television at the age of three. Henceforth, this is one of the pieces of evidence that television is able to educate children. In addition, children can also learn some moral values from movies. This can help to nurture good behavior in the children. Currently, parents often allow their kids to watch documentary films on television. This is in light of the fact that it helps them develop a vast cauldron of knowledge and they are able to know more about the world. Hence, I agree that television actually is able to educate us.

I usually play a game in my free time. I help my parents to finish their work. After 8 o'clock, I go to the market with my mother to buy vegetables, meat and fish and I help to cook for our lunch. After that, I go to school to pick my young sister up. I have a nap in the evening. Then, I prepare to eat dinner. After all of that, I start to play a game with my friends.

I'm in the process of creating a blog in the English language to satisfy my passion for writing. After taking a look on Write and Improve, I jumped at the chance to train and get my English writing to a new level. I was a bit confused at the beginning when I realised that instead of providing me with any basic guidelines for how to write a correct sentence or perfect paragraph, I had to cope with some lists of tasks which allow me to choose an appropriate level to start with. Well, I think this is the place you can totally improve your English yourself by writing and writing again. Our mission is to keep exercising every single day, and they will check your spellings, show the incorrect words and track your progress. It sounds great, right? No matter how I discuss each task they require, they don't score my presentation based on persuadable sentences, so I'm free to let things out from my comprehension. There are some things in the first step which just want to stop you trying, and you need to fight them. When I had finished about six tasks, they frustrated me with the result on the board that showed my levels going down. It made me feel that the more I wrote, the more disappointments I got. Bearing in mind this must've been the first challenge, I put it in the back of my mind and headed forwards to other tasks. And step by step, I could finally appreciate my effort when I figured out my English writing had been going so much farther than I had expected - fewer incorrect spellings, fewer silly sentences and in less time. The program will help improve your English writing skill just like it's done for me. But don't forget that you will need a lot of patience which helps you go faster.

I can agree with the opinion that always telling the truth is important to some extent. In general, being an honest and reliable person is very important and nowadays it can be a rarity. That's why these people are mostly very appreciated by others. In my opinion, when you are such a person you are probably wise and intelligent. Therefore you know that there are situations where telling a lie is almost necessary. I have in mind moments when telling a lie does not hurt a second person. Moreover he or she might be thankful after he figures out that you did that. Sometimes you need to tell a lie to avoid bothering another person. It can happen when you or somebody else is very seriously sick. When the person whom you told a lie to cannot do anything, maybe for him/her it would be better because he/she cannot change anything and he/she would only be furious or get mad. There is something like a lie with a good intention. In my opinion, telling a lie is in general a bad idea but there are many exceptions when doing that is not bad and even though that person finds out about this after time he forgives you without a doubt. A lie is a bad thing when you use it as a way to achieve something.

If I had to pick one kind of teacher, I would say that both kinds of teacher are definitely needed for a good quality of a student's education. A teacher giving lessons to the same students for several years could create a stronger relationship among students and between the students and him, and deeper knowledge in specific topics. In biology, for example, the learning process is recommended to be guided by just one professor. Importantly, the teacher must be a good one. Other classes would be better if they were taught by different professors, such as art and political topics because the students can understand and learn with a greater diversity of points of view. To compare art with biology: the heart is to keep the blood flowing is an opinion shared by any biologist, instead the origin of a political problem could change from one professor to another in a huge way depending on who is teaching it. These are my reasons to respond that mixing both types of professor is the better option.

Having the same teacher offers a lot of advantages. The same person can follow you, your development, and results over a longer period of time. The mutual relationship should be better and the teacher can evaluate the students even better. On the other hand, if the relationship is negatively affected, then it's difficult to repair. You can't easily change the opinion of somebody. The conclusion is that a teacher may not want to help you because of a bad experience. The second proposal was to have a new teacher each year. I like this idea because it's not common and I have heard of it for the first time. It would also give a lot of chances. As a student you will meet a few teachers during your schooldays. Some will stimulate you more and some maybe less. You will have experienced more teacher skills and approaches. In the end, you have a wide range and you can choose what you like most. I am always in favour of changes and I would decide to change the teacher each year to gain more experience with this approach. Someday you will be able to assess both approaches.

Since I was born I have been fat. My mom said to me that I used to eat a lot. I was told that I can't behave like a thin person. Sometimes I used to fall side or I always used to look at food when I was baby. That's interesting, isn't it? When I was growing up, I wouldn't stop gaining weight or I didn't lose weight. I used to try to go on a diet, but it never worked out. However, it didn't work out because I didn't use to follow the diet correctly. Today, I'm 23. I've found out that doing some exercise can be good for us and for our mind. Yes, you read it correctly. I was reading an article and in it was written that when you do some exercise, it might help your mind to remember what you have seen or what you have read. Plus, it might help you to save more information in your mind, mainly if you are a student. Of course, you need to separate some time every day for working out. That's the same for everything!

My favourite season is summer. During the summer vacation, our embraced families come to meet us. So I love their company, particularly Julian's. Aunt Julian loves me most. She makes me chocolate cookies. Then I eat most of the cookies. Apart from my aunt's company, there is Christ, who is my best friend. Mostly, Christ and I enjoy playing football together during the summer, so we always become tired, then we relax peacefully. After one crazy month, our families go to my grandfather's farmhouse and apart from the farmhouse area, there is one precious river. Sometimes we go there and make camp to spend the night on the riverside. The view of the beautiful night gets reflected in the river, which makes this whole movement unforgettable. Then we get back to our home city with these summer memories. These things make the summer season more special for me as well as for my loving family.

Let us start by identifying: volunteer work is done by people who accept to do something themselves without any requirement. Just by reading the word 'volunteer' meaning, we figure out that some schools might forget or ignore the consistency of what they require their students to do. Obviously volunteer work benefits many things and people. It's so respectful if you are a part of it, but it's acceptable if you feel like refusing. That's all your choice. One thing that is so important, you are not supposed to give anyone help, if you do, that's just kind of you. There is not even just a minimum mistake here, you'll simply not be able to receive a 'thank-you' word. There is a thing called ethics, which is defined by people as the right behaviour towards others. Volunteering comes out of the box filled with that right behaviour or the negative, it should be put in a wholly different box with the label written 'good to be done' attached. I never mean to encourage people not to go for volunteer work, but mean it's fine if people have no interest. That's their choice. Don't judge them at all. I know that we always need people who work as volunteers in every field. This is essential work for our lives. Nevertheless, we don't have to spend too much time on it and without lots of attempts. Go back to the debate about some schools require students to do a certain volunteer work in order to graduate. Why don't they just find out some effective methods for this problem? For me, instead of giving requirement to students, they could encourage them to do it. The more work they do, the more privilege they would have to go on the path to graduation. I think this will work well. Again, never a requirement!

Hello everyone, I thank you for your question. I think animals belong in nature. Especially in the forest, because they are creatures and they have feelings like every human being. The fact is that some people like giving their opinions without any idea about the issue. An example of this is that some people think animals are a good object of study! I'll try to explain some things with an example. When a student wants to learn, he goes to school, to a teacher, to a university, and to a library. The teacher and the university won't be brought to the student. The same thing should happen when people want to learn about animals. The animals should be visited by people in order to be able to behave themselves naturally. If you bring a bird into a cage to a it, you won't learn about it, but rather you are persecuting it, because you can not constrain some animals to learn about them. Finally, I hope that people will feel at some stage that animals have feelings like people; maybe more than people. Thank you. Ahmad

It is said that 80 percent of a language consists of vocabulary and only 20 percent of grammar, which is often overlooked, although it is equally important. Teaching support, like in face-to-face lessons helps to clarify questions, and furthermore pushes students above their limit because teachers can give some personalised advice. Learning a language mainly based on online lessons requires a high level of self-discipline and self-motivation. In terms of flexibility, it may be an advantage as time differences or suffering from illnesses does not matter. Nevertheless, the easiest way to internalise a foreign language is to be surrounded by it, hence a stay abroad is highly recommended to boost the progress of learning. This can become a once-in-a-lifetime experience that students always like to reminisce about. To sum it up, difficulties may arise no matter which method you choose, but drive and determination coupled with patience and perseverance will lead to success. Keeping this in mind, do not expect yourself to run before you can walk.

Have you ever had a friend who is able to play at least one kind of musical instrument? Yes, you might have. Do you think that they have the capacity of doing some certain things faster and better than other people? It sounds so obvious that I totally agree that students should study music. It not only benefits their studying, but also works for some certain situations in their daily lives. When we start to know more about music, it might be a little hard for some, but when you keep playing them, you will no longer feel like doing homework, but like making friends. You might not use music as your life-long job, but you should learn it as the right support. Firstly, it's helpful for your concentration. When you're studying to read a song or trying to remember chords to play a song on the guitar, you're required to completely focus on it, because you won't want to break up beautiful pieces of music into chaotic sections. Yes, you need to learn how to be the whole part of the song you're playing or creating. Next, I don't think you would say that you have never been stressed out by your job, even you really love the job. You surely can listen to your favourite music to make a balance between work and living life, but if you can play a song for yourself instead, it works even better. Is it wrong when I've just said it is the right support for the path of your career? Do you agree that working or studying with a good memory is a fascinating thing you must be interested in? You will start with each musical note for the complex melody of some hard songs, and consequently, it becomes a part of your life which you can use to work with the aim of making things more convenient. That sounds great, doesn't it? Are you interested in joining a music class today?

Nowadays, most people share the view that music is not a trustworthy choice when deciding on a professional career. In spite of that, music lessons should not be forgotten or ignored, as music provides a great number of benefits to people of any age. Firstly, it is undeniable that music may seem to be not as relevant as other subjects at school, which could be maths, history or biology, for example. However, some research about music and learning how to play an instrument that is easy to handle has asserted that it can help children to improve their bodily skills, memory and social habits, etc. Secondly, the number of music lessons students have is an important point to consider since, given the irrefutable advantages of music, it is also true that music must not be a prime subject. Therefore, it would be reasonable for students to enjoy from 1 to 3 music lectures per week. Last but not least, the obligation of studying that subject should be mentioned too, because music should not be a mandatory subject in every school year, instead, students may study it mandatorily for only one course so they have more general knowledge, and from then onwards, it is advised to give them the opportunity to choose if they want to continue their music studies or not. In conclusion, from my point of view, everybody should be enabled to know their study preferences in order to choose what subject pleases them more, and music should not be excluded from that list.

Today's generation is inclined towards the routine of indolence which is hazardous for their health. Being involved in sports might help students to be physically fit and active in any kind of performance whether it is taking part in competitions or studies. Educational institutions are concerned about the physical fitness of students for their betterment and healthy lifestyle. I totally agree with the statement that schools must inculcate sports activities for young people. To commence with, it is true that sports help the younger generation to build strength to participate in various activities. It also leads them towards a healthy routine which curbs the sedentary behavior in any field. Moreover, it can be seen that people who are involved in sports or do regular exercise are more active than those who only sit and enjoy food or stick to their phone. In addition, sports activities also build self-confidence in students, which helps them in achieving their goals. On the other hand, today's generation is clinging to technology or mobile phones due to which they get possessive about their gadgets. Most of the study material is available on mobile phones. However, it restricts them from outdoor activities. Furthermore, this sedentary behavior leads them towards health issues such as obesity, anxiety or mental depression. As a result, adults get addicted to the consumption of alcohol, smoking or, other substances. Thus, to deal with these situations and to make the youth more active. parents should encourage their children to take part in sports from an early age and school plays a vital role in promoting these activities because it is the place from where we adopt the habits. Having considered all the above points, I totally agree that educational institutions should impose exercise classes or sports events to avoid unhealthy diets and a sedentary lifestyle. It is difficult for most of the children to adopt these habits. Nevertheless, they are not impossible to obtain in our daily routine.

Personally, I think that books should be replaced by technological devices in many fields, especially for educational purposes. First, technology provides us with easier access to information with no limits. Indeed, search engines allow students to look for explanations, research, and studies. Besides, schools and universities are using smart devices to facilitate teaching and education. Studies prove that teaching lessons with tablets and computers is more efficient than it is using books. Added to that, despite the fact that books are the roots of the Internet, I believe that the web gives pupils the chance to discover the wide world of lessons by learning new stuff in a shorter period than by using books and papers. Eventually, I think that computers and tablets simplify education more than books do and therefore they should be replaced by technological devices in schools and universities.

I think learning to speak a new language is definitely important, but not as important as it was in the past, because now we got things like Google Translate. So it is not necessary if you want to communicate with other people, whereas people from the time before there were phones and the internet had to learn a language or get a translator in order to communicate with people speaking different languages. On the other hand, learning a new language may help you to understand your own language better, especially how languages work and where words come from. This can also make it easier to learn other languages. It can also be useful if you want to study abroad or live in another country where most people don't speak English, because if you know the language it will become easier to communicate with them.

This article is based on reasons for learning English and I will explain why it is important to me. From my point of view, it is very important to speak English if you want to get a good job. In international companies, it is common to speak English. Unfortunately , in Spain there is no multilingual culture, films are not subtitled. We have people who translate the films and here is the problem. People do not try to learn another language. Another reason that is important is to be able to travel to any country, because there they speak English very well. I recognize that I am interested in speaking English because I love to travel. I like to communicate with other people and one big problem is the language difficulty. To sum up, I want to say that there are reasons why I want to learn English.

For me, it's quite easy to take a clear stand on this matter. In my opinion, the more teachers you have, the better. Why? Because from each of them you can take something. If you have the ability to understand people and to distinguish what is right or wrong it will be simple to take advantage of their knowledge and experience. For many people, having the same teacher for several years is better. I think it is because they do not like to leave their comfort zone. Most people get used to one teacher and they do not want any change because this is a convenient situation for them. In my opinion, the time for education is too short in most countries. That's why kids and teenagers should have a more varied way of gathering knowledge. How to do it? I believe the simplest way to do this is to let them have contact with the highest number of teachers possible. Thanks to that they will be able to see many ways of looking at different topics and particular knowledge.

Hi everybody. In connection with your request in the latest edition of the magazine, I would like to write my review about the one tool for learning English which I recently found. This tool is called "Write and Improve" and it is about writing articles/opinions/stories/emails which can be checked after and the program will automatically find your mistakes and rate your level of English.

Living alone these days has become commonplace, so some people support living alone and being on their own because sometimes you will have a lot of obligations, so you do not worry at a young age, while others believe that you should live with your family. This essay will discuss both sides and will draw my personal conclusion. On one hand, some students prefer to rely on themselves, especially when they graduate from high school, because their university site is usually far from the city, so they want to save money, for instance , on transportation and fast food. In addition , when you get used to providing money and preparing food yourself, you can succeed in forming a family in the future. So that's why some think it's amazing to get through tough situations on your own. In conclusion , after careful analysis of the viewpoints , I believe that living with your family is very important , especially when you live in the Asian or African continent , because people prefer the customs and traditions .

Some college students go away and stay on their own, whilst others prefer to stay with their family members in a shared house. In my opinion, it's better to stay with the family because they can provide unconditional support during critical situations , and help their children to concentrate on their studies. Even though it is true that students learn a lot by living on their own, I think it is good to live in the family house. One reason for this is that they provide all kinds of support whenever required without expecting anything in return. This means that they won't be under pressure to do any sort of household work and as a result, they won't get depressed. To illustrate this, recent research by leading psychologists in the USA has shown that the students who spend their childhood with their parents living in the same house never feel demotivated. Another reason why I believe that it is important to stay with parents is that kids need to focus and concentrate on their studies. Their parents' home is the best place for this because they get all the resources and additionally, elderly people can share their experience which would lead pupils to understand the subject better. For example, according to extensive research, pupils aged between 10 and 20 who stay with their elders do far better in exams than those who stay on their own. In conclusion, although it may be hard to live with parents, I think they provide the best support which cannot be given by anyone else. Also students can get help from their elders in studies in order to achieve good marks.

In my personal experience , when I studied in high school , my teacher ordered me to do some task and I had to complete this task. So I collected participants in order to work like a crew and share obligations together. We were task in the volunteering, to care for the environment. To illustrate, because the increase in pollution in the air leads to the destruction of a landscape, we save the garden the garden in the school. In addition , each of us grows a plant in our house and school . For example, I was eager for interesting from the trees, I wrote many academic articles about the danger of the industrial chemicals and the effects resulting from the exhaust of old cars. Finally , the manager responded positively to us and he liked it. In conclusion , volunteering was the greatest step in my life , because it taught me the importance of mankind's life and cooperation .

In my opinion, schools will be different in the future. Technology is highly developed in this century, and it continues to improve itself. The schools will improve themselves with this technology. Students will use better technological tools for their education, and these tools will help them better than old tools. Technology will provide better conditions for students. They will learn better, and they will have more ability than us. They might not go to school in the future. They might have their education at home on a computer. On the other hand, these developments will provide some worse conditions. If they have their education at home, they won't meet their friends and teachers. As a result, schools will be developed and be better than today. The students will have better education conditions, and these conditions can be beneficial for them.

There is no doubt that these days zoos are becoming very popular. However, the question is if they are a good place to learn about animals. It is an issue considered today. Personally, I believe that zoos are the safest place to learn many things about animals. There are several reasons why most people believe that: it's easy to arrive there , safe, and one can communicate with animals. The first reason why people think zoos are a good place to learn about animals is that it is easy to go to them . For instance, there are many zoos in many cities and countries around the world; thus, it is easy to visit any one of them to see different species of animals. The second reason is that zoos are safe for people to see the dangerous animals such as lions. Moreover, they are a good place to learn new information about the animals and how they live or what they eat. The third reason is a good way to communicate between humans and animals in a safe place with people who are experts in dealing with dangerous animals. Additionally, zoos help many organisations such as schools to teach children about animals by taking them on a trip to the zoo. In conclusion, they are a safe place, easy to visit, and communicate with animals made make up the main three reasons why people tend to believe zoos are a good place to learn about animals. However, zoos have a big role to animals, so they have to treat the animals kindly because that will reflect on the environment.

Hello and thank you for your question. I think that moving for a semester of studying to another country is a very helpful thing, which someone can do to learn different things and maybe a different language. In addition to that, one might have new experiences with other teachers and learn new teaching methodologies. However, some students think that studying in a new country might make one lose concentration on one learning methodology and teaching methodology. It might also be very difficult to be able to pass examinations, because of being in a new university, which evaluates some different school subjects that the previous university didn't teach them. One more thing, some teacher who are not competent in teaching might be employed at one school or at one university. In this case, students have little chance to get information from those unsuitable teachers. In the end, one should collect enough information about the new school before going to it to study. Thank you.

Hi Tom, I am writing because I want to say that yesterday I went to a concert. I went to see Ara Malikian. He is a famous violinist. He is Lebanese, but he has Spanish nationality. I am sorry to tell you that there were no more tickets. I tried to buy more. In the concert, Ara Malikia played for an hour and it is unbelievable how he plays the violin. It seems that the strings are going to break. Do not worry if you do not see him in Spain. I am sure that he will probably go to London. I recommend that you see his web page. Best regards,

Dear English teacher, Thank you for your question. I really like learning through hearing English stories and through speaking, after I have learned enough grammar. It means, I can't stand writing or speaking falsely. More than that, I like being qualified to understand fast speakers. I would love to improve speaking by using the best words in the best context. In addition to this, I would be able to increase my knowledge so that I can teach what I know. If I can translate between my mother tongue and English, I will be such a happy guy. I also would be able to write an disquistion and documentation about new research to interpret the information with examples. I have a lot of learning methodologies. An example of this is that I use online tools to practise writing skills. I try to translate some Arabic poetry to English. Some translation applications are constantly being used to dive in synonyms and antonyms of new words (vocabulary). I think, one day I will be able to use English better than English people. Thank you for you efforts. Ahmad

Well, in my opinion, it depends upon the standard at which student study. But books are best. Weight is the only problem. Governments should take action to reduce the weight of a school bag. The majority of adults hate carrying books. It was also discovered that most adults own mobiles. And the majority of them waste time on playing games on mobiles or tablets. Hence by including more digital material we could reduce the cons of technology . Thus, to conclude, computers and tablets should not replace the widely accepted system, instead an all-new approach should be introduced. Such a system will have the advantages of both systems. For example: in India, there is a hybrid education system known as Educomo. Educomo has pre-recorded teaching videos, therefore it reduces the manpower required to teach our students.

Yes, it is very important to learn a foreign language and it learnt that a foreign language could provide exponential growth in the following areas: personal development, social development, competitive edge, and bilateral advantages. A foreign language learner can possess excellent brainpower. The learner's ability to switch from one language to another contributes to personal development. the personal development of the learner. A bilingual person may have excellent communication skills which could help them get employed in an international company. Also, a bilingual person can go from one end of the world to another end. Therefore, the foreign language learner has an edge over others. Every country must negotiate with their neighbouring countries for their safety and security, hence it is important to learn their languages so that successful communication will be carried out. Many companies presume that their employees speak at least one foreign language to increase the companies' presence across the globe. Therefore, learning to speak a foreign language is as important these days as it was in the past.

Leading an inactive lifestyle has many negative effects on health. That is the reason why a proposal has been put forth: obliging all university students and school children to do sports activities at least three times a week. Is this really a good idea? On the one hand, forcing something like this upon people is very authoritarian. A law forcing the youth to do sports activities would infringe on personal and bodily autonomy. It would give the state more control over our youth's personal lives and diminish their sense of personal responsibility. With freedom comes responsibility, and both of those are very important to have and properly make use of in life. If from a young age the child has great personal autonomy, they will better learn to make use of it than if the state were to interfere. The proposal made above, were it made into law, would stunt our children's ability to administer their own lives. On the other hand, the benefits of sports activities are so great and many that a sacrifice of some freedom may be justified. Physical activity improves both physical and mental health, as well as cognitive abilities. And in the context of schooling, where children are forced to do tasks anyway, it would make sense to make use of the advantages of sport. Moreover, there are generalised benefits for the whole of society. Healthier people get sick less and live longer, putting overall less strain on the public healthcare system. This saves costs, since treatment is very expensive, a lot more than prevention in the form of sports activities. This saves taxpayers and the government loads of money. All in all, the benefits of forcing our youth to do sport outweigh any possible objections. They are already obligated to do a variety of tasks in school, and adding sport to that would only have benefits.

In my opinion, if a group feel comfortable with a specific teacher and the results are satisfactory, then, the best option is to maintain the teacher with the same students. However, it's known that in almost all schools the students have a different teacher for each subject. Which shows us that students are used to taking classes with different teachers. From my experience in my life as a student in a high school, some of my teachers were changing every semester, but my group maintained the same math teacher for 2 years . He was the best math teacher that I've ever known, the way that he taught made me love math. On the other hand we had a different English teacher every year, which was inefficient for us because we couldn't get used to the way of teaching of each teacher. In consequence, we weren't able to learn English. When I finished high school my level of English was really poor, so I had to learn it at another school. I think every student has different ways of learning and every teacher has different ways of teaching. Then, it's difficult to know what is better for the students because what works for some, on occasion doesn't work for others.

I had a lot of 'best holidays' throughout my life. So, choosing just one of them is a big task for me. I have been thinking and I decided to choose one when I travelled to a beach to work as an intern in Ubatuba. In that city, I met people who have been close to me until now. Every day that I spent over there was full of knowledge, fun, and reflections. I miss it so much when I got off work and I went to the beach to swim and drink some beers with my new friends. Besides that, my co-workers and I shared the same house for one whole month! It was fun when we cooked together or helped each other to get out to go to work. This time was amazing! When I returned to my city, I thought a lot about what I wanted in my life and what my goals were. Certainly, this holiday changed my life and I'm grateful for having lived all this.

What is the meaning of life? Life is very complicated. It depends on the person. Some people's life is full of happiness, some people's life is full of surprise, some people's life is full of sadness and some people's life is even full of hardships. We must choose our own life, we have the right to choose the life we want to live. I saw many people's life were tied up by their parents. Their parents did not let them to have the opportunity to choose their own life. I feel quite pitying towards them. As for me, I won't allow the others to lift a single finger to arrange my life, I insist on choosing my own life no matter how. If I was given to choose to live a long, calm life until 100 years old or a shorter life but much more intense, I think I would choose to have a shorter life but much more intense. Do you know why? This is because living a short life, one does not need to suffer from different kinds of illness like diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. When we are getting old, varied illnesses and diseases will start to come towards us. This is because when we are getting old, our body starts to undergo an ageing process and our immunity system starts to decline. After hearing these, do you still want to live a long, calm but suffer from a sick life? I bet that we won't like it! Everyone gets ill when they are old because this is one of the parts of life. This is why I would rather choose a shorter life but much more intense instead of living a long, calm life. Plus, we feel very lonely and sad after seeing our own friends and family members pass away one by one. Sadness and loneliness will start to fill up our heart little by little after losing our loved ones. If I live a short but much more intense life, most of my friends and family will still stay by my side and I will be able to confront the most brutal setbacks and hardships with their help. I am sure that they will be the first ones to be there to seek solace from me if they are defeated by failure. Hence, these are the reasons why I would choose to live a short but much more intense life. In addition, do you want to see yourself getting old? As for me, I do not want to see those wrinkles keep on appearing on my face, my hair turning black to white and my back getting more and more hunched. These are the signs of getting old and this reminds me that I am getting old and need to get more help from the others. I don't like to depend on the others because this might be a burden to the one who takes care of you. Furthermore, a short but yet intense life can make us live in good shape and full of different colours. In conclusion, a long, calm life will not only make us feel very lonely but also sad. Therefore, I choose to live a short but intense life over a long, calm life.

Some people believe that nowadays it is not necessary to learn languages. The question is why. At present, a mobile phone has applications that translate straight away. Because of this, many people think that it is not vital. From my point of view, I consider that it is very important to learn a language. My reasons are the following: First, when you are reading a book in English, it is different to read an English book or a Spanish book. The meaning of the phrases changes from one language to another. Second, when you learn a language , your mind changes. That is, there are studies that have demonstrated that if you learn another language (different from your mother tongue), you will improve your cerebral cortex. Your brain secretes a substance which helps to avoid degenerative illnesses, like Alzheimer. To sum up, I consider that it is very important to learn languages and discover other cultures.

Write and Improve is an app by Cambridge University made for students in order to improve their writing. I have used this app for a month and therefore will summarize my experiences in the following paragraphs. Firstly, I would like to write about the biggest advantage Write and Improve has, namely the check function. This means you can write a text and after completing the task, the program checks it for you. This has helped me not only improve my grammar and vocabulary, but also my style of writing. Another argument worth mentioning is that the app is helpful because there are many different levels of language. Therefore, Write and Improve enables their users to improve and move on to the tasks that best fit their needs. For my last argument, I have to mention an aspect of this website I have not found helpful, which is the costs. Although the first tasks are for free, most of the workbooks have to be paid for. This is an obstacle for learners who do not have the money to pay for the app. In conclusion, I can highly recommend this app, since it has helped me and many other users improve our English skills.

I started thinking about this question when I was a child, because when I was eight years old I saw the film "Troy" for the first time in my life. Our history teacher gave us as homework to watch that movie because we were studying the history of Ancient Greece in that period. I was so impressed by Achilleus's character, because he could have anything he wanted: a long life, a wife, health and a family, but he chose, being aware of the consequences, to leave for Troy, knowing that he wouldn't ever come back home. I couldn't explain to myself why, it was totally unobvious for the little girl I was. But then, going on watching the movie, I got it clearly: he was doing it for glory and immortality. Living a long, calm and boring life would have made him unsatisfied: what is the point of living 100 years if your life isn't worth living? Emotions, feelings, experiences are what keep us alive, so I would prefer to live a shorter life, but full, lived and not wasted, instead of spending my time doing nothing because everything is dangerous. If you stop a moment and think about the risks, you will understand that everything is risky, so you wouldn't do anything. I'm not talking about having mad experiences, I'm just talking of living freely and fully, tasting every single moment that life has to offer to us. Besides, we have just one life, it's pretty inconvenient to waste it. So I would have left, exactly like Achilleus did, to live the life I wanted for me.

Hello everyone, Thank you for giving me this opportunity to write about this issue. I have to imagine an answer, because I have never been on any necessary holiday. The most important holiday I have ever been on was when I went to a country where there are people who cannot read or write. I had to go to try to teach them how they would be able to read to read without being able to read, if only they will read. The idea might seem too complex at the beginning, but it is not. The word reading is usually mixed with the word reciting. I have already said that I have tried to teach people to recite. Why did I want to tell them about this idea? Because the time was too short to help them be able to read and I have read in the history that some knowledgeable people were not able to read. It is so; not being able to read does not mean being stupid at all. That is why I taught them how they can hear something important and interesting and repeat it many times till they can recite it without any difficulties, so can they teach each other what some professors cannot teach their own students. I have been happy to help them break the rock of ignorance.

The question I will discuss in this essay is the following: should university students and school children be forced to do sports activities at least three times per week? Sport is very important for a healthy lifestyle, but should we force people to do it? Doing any kind of sport certainly has an effect on your lifestyle. It is good to exercise your body. It needs to move, otherwise your body just gets stiff and that can cause other health issues. You can't just hang out on the couch and expect to have a healthy lifestyle. Getting people to play sport is a good idea and one reason why it is often included in the curriculum in primary and secondary school. So even if there are people who do not sport outside of school, they at least exercise once or twice a week. However, the question is whether you want to force people into doing sports activities. People don't like to be forced, especially when they do not like the thing they are forced to do. However, with sports activities it is a bit different. There are so many sports nowadays, that it is almost impossible to not like any sport. Each person has their own preference when it comes to exercising. Besides, it is very easy to, for example for young children, hide any kind of sports activity in some fun game. Those high energetic games should be considered sports activities. So you either really have to force people into sports, or somebody should come up with an alternative plan to get people into sports. I think that we should not force people to do sports activities. That is because I think that there really are people who just struggle with getting themselves to do some sort of exercise. However, I do think that playing sports should be more encouraged. Sports clubs can organise fun recruitment days to promote their sport.

I completely agree with that opinion. If you have lost your health, you can be rich, nevertheless, you can't be happy in your life. Imagine that you have a lot of money, cars, and homes, however you have got cancer. What is their worth, if you don't have your health? So, we need to attach importance to our health. We should do this. What can we do to take care of our health? We should eat healthy food in terms of vitamins, protein, and oil. We need some healthy oils, like peanut and avocado. We should eat the necessary amount of vitamins and protein. Secondly, we should do exercise four times a week. Exercise is a significant thing to stay healthy. We can go walking, running, and do fitness. If we do these things, we can stay healthy. As a result, in my opinion, to be healthy is more significant than to be rich. Money may not bring you health.

In the era of technology, everything changes rapidly, among which education is the most affected. Dating back, books are one of the most essential and crucial tools for education. Replacing the existence of books, computers are now generally used for the sake of learning. On the one hand, some declare that books are the existence that can not be replaced. On the other hand, some counter by comparing the convenience and flexibility of books and computers. In my opinion, the latter one is preferable to the former. Nowadays, numerous teachers from college to senior high utilize technology to enrich their courses. With a computer at hand, teachers can easily have access to the abundant resources online. Moreover, learning the lessons through the internet, students can ask questions without the restriction of needing to be at school. In the light of the above, I think computers and tablets definitely have the potential of completely replacing books in the realm of education.

Hello everyone, I thank you for this opportunity. I will tell you about some important things which help you to keep yourselves healthy. Practicing sport is necessary for your body, but there are really many more necessary measures that protect your health. The most important measure is eating healthy food. The body has limited power and unhealthy food affects health badly. Unhealthy drinks also affect health badly. I guess sleeping early and waking up early are also truly healthy actions to assist your immunity system. Sleeping too long might also have bad effects on health. An additional bad thing is arguing with people. Working for a long time will cause health and psychological problems, especially if one works five days a week. Don't think about bad past events, which has unexiting consequences. Don't care a lot about the future. Thank you. Ahmad

Given the fact that traditional businesses tend to establish enclosed stations in which workers are separated from employers, several modern offices are designed with open space meaning there is no barrier amid co-workers. In my opinion, working in an open space offers workers creativity and better conversation among them. To begin with, a growing number of companies have been switching old cubicles to spacious design due to its efficient results on workflow. Nowadays, a great number of graduates are not confident enough to show their abilities and desire to stay focused on doing private things in their spare time rather than having a meeting with their co-workers. As a result, most of them find themselves stuck in communication and teamwork which leads to a downfall in the whole result of the company. As there is no visible barrier, co-workers will have more face-to-face interactions related to work and afterward the workflow might run effectively and smoothly thanks to an approachable space. A well - known software corporation called Google has been applying the open design since its establishment, which helps its workers easier in exchanging information and taking a deep breath during work. In conclusion, I reaffirm that an open design offers an effective environment in the workplace because the workers find it more convenient for exchanging ideas and information revolving around the work.

I want to start by saying that the school of the future will be different. That is to say, I consider that high school will be different in how they will teach a class. I strongly believe that it will be online. It will only be for children under 10 years old. To begin with, I want to say that today school is changing, it is more practical and more technological. The use of tablets is more common. In addition, the Covid pandemic has taught us that online classes exist and work. Students have learned to organize themselves with online classes.

In my view, I think all students need to change teachers throughout the years, because it is important for students to see opinions and ways of living your life. All teachers have their style to explain something, and during classes, sometimes teachers give examples of their life to try to explain a matter. This act helps students understand more about everything, it is a benefit to students. If students have the same teacher all years, it is boring, because it is the same every year, week, and every day and it is necessary to change. Because in real life, students will be a professional in their area than will work,. things are always changing for us, at school, at the supermarket, at the bank, at the police, at the government. It is never forever, it is good to change and grow up with these changes.

The theme of this essay is "Television entertains, but can it also educate?." I agree with the argument that watching TV conditions our well-being. I will try to prove the thesis that television seldom educates. Firstly, modern television provides a lot of various programmes, breakfast programmes and soap operas take first place. The impact of these programmes on our behaviour is enormous, we only waste time. Secondly, many people watch TV news, they have been waiting for information, especially shocking information. This can be seen primarily among young people. Is this healthy? Of course not, because that could change their way of thinking and understanding reality. We should teach teenagers positive thinking. Thirdly, there are changes all over the world, television is replaced by the internet and new technology. We turn on the television less and less. Young people spend more time using the Internet websites, mobile phones, and a lot of communication platforms. Obviously, many people like watching TV, but their purpose is not education but only entertainment and fun. Furthermore, today a lot of television is controlled by governments and businesses, so that shapes our political views and our worldview. This is not okay. It has been demonstrated that television entertains, but it's not educational. We could watch TV only for fun, but if we want to learn something we should read a book or use a computer and an education website.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? When there are more and more computers and tablets, some people ask themselves something like that. To my way of thinking, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Firstly, computers and tablets are much better than books because they can hold a million times more information than a 400/800-page book. If you want to find something, it will take you 15, 20, or even 30 minutes to get information from books. But with a computer or a tablet, it would take less than 5 minutes to get it. Secondly, computers and tablets hold much more types of data than a book. If you are carrying a computer or a tablet that also means you are carrying a thousand books. Finally, they are more convenient. An e-book costs much less than a traditional book. The information in a digital form can be edited and shared easily. This makes them overall convenient for students who might not be able to afford one copy of a book each. In a nutshell, computers and tablets are much more convenient than traditional books. They should completely replace books in schools and universities.

Travel in the future Travelling is moving from place A to place B with public transport vehicles, trains, buses, airplanes, ships, private cars, etc. I think there will be big changes in the duration of journeys. They will be a lot shorter than current journeys. They will also be more comfortable. The capacity of vehicles will be bigger. The available joy tools will be more. The time of departure and the time of arrival will be more punctual. The appearance of booking applications and web pages will be programmed more amazingly. Free internet access will be available on every journey. The noise, which is produced by a vehicle's engines, will be softer. The bad effects of those engines will become milder. That means, engines will produce less CO2 and bad gases. Engines might become electrical and won't be able to produce any gases. It will be better for the people who like travelling, and at the same time they won't affect nature badly. Finally, these predictions might be totally different from the reality, but one is allowed to imagine new possible innovations. Thank you.

New technologies have been developed. Researchers from the most famous universities of the world are still studying, focusing on new solutions and technological strategies. These are referring especially to the future of travel. Not only on the Earth, but also in space. During the last two centuries, the way of travelling from one place to another one has drastically changed. The first industrial revolution provided new means of transport and tools. Ships, trains, and so on were the beginning of the Modern Age. Nowadays, cars , trains, planes, and so forth are enhanced by using new smart materials and technological processes. The aim of the most important factories of the world and aerospace companies, such as NASA and ESA, consists of succeeding in reaching Mars. Concerning travel on the Earth, many tests have been done in these years. A very interesting one is the design of a 'flying car', which is able to carry passengers in the air, among the skyscrapers of the metropolises. The first prototype is likely to be available for commerce by 2024. This is proof that travel is bound to be really different in the near future, which will be better and better.

My reasons for learning English are business life and other things. English is an extensive language in our century. It is a common language. It's a beneficial thing there is a common language because if I learn English I can talk to people from other countries who know English. Every establishment wants you to know English in order to admit you to their establishment. If I want to have a good job, I should learn English. A good job gives a good income, and this leads to a happy life. On the other hand, it is the best way to communicate with foreign people. You have a different language, but you know English. That's a point. If two foreign people know English, they will create communication with each other. Another reason is I like to learn a language. Learning a language is a long process, but it is amusing. I want to learn a different language in the future, like Spanish or German.

The television is one of the most popular electronic devices used by families. Obviously, the purpose of entertainment is accountable for its popularity. Moreover, I believe television can be used as an educational tool which people use to learn new things. There are a variety of programs on TV, such as news, travel, food, etc... and people could learn from them. For example, news programs provide information about the world. By watching them, we are aware of what is happening around us. We get to know about the places, countries, or the topics mentioned in the news. Some programs are very beneficial, especially for children. For instance, children can learn about animals in the wild by watching animal programs without actually going into the wild. This is a very convenient and safe way to learn. Sitting in front of the TV after a tiring day to relax is a very common activity, which might entertain and educate at the same time.

Nowadays, people are eating unhealthy food and living an inactive lifestyle. It is argued that all university students and school pupils should be pushed forcefully to take part in sports games at least 3 times in a week due to the negative effect on their body of a lazy lifestyle. I agree with this because those activities would help people to live a healthy life and are important for students to focus and concentrate. Even though it is true that sports activities take a lot of one's time, I think these activities are very important for all the individuals, especially for students. One reason for this is that it would lead to them losing weight and leading a much healthier and happier life, so in long run, they would enable them to be an active individual. To illustrate this, recently Norway implemented strict rules and regulations for all the high school students to play games on any three days in a week. This had a dramatic effect on keeping their weight under control. Another reason they are necessary is that students can achieve better results in exams. This is because exercise will make the students tired, so they can get a sound sleep at night. This would let them focus on their classes and understand the subjects better. As a result, they can perform well in schools and universities and eventually, get a well-paid job. For example, according to extensive research, pupils aged between 10 and 15 who play any kind of sports game do far better in exams than those who don't do any type of activities. To conclude, although students might not find sports games interesting, I think it is important because students can live a beautiful and happy life. Also, they can achieve better marks in schools and universities.

I want to say that my favorite season is autumn and I will give reasons why. First, I love autumn because I like the colours that are shown in that season. These colours are brown, yellow, red, and others that are wonderful if you like to photograph landscapes. In the future, you can enjoy the landscapes in photos. When these colours come into contact with the sky, they create a kind of sentimental atmosphere. Second, I strongly believe that it is spectacular when they fall from the trees and a park is beautiful when it's all covered in coloured leaves that have fallen from the trees. It is true that it is very dangerous when it rains. You can slip on a leaf and you can break a foot. For this reason, I consider that the most beautiful season of the four is autumn.

New school year, new goals The purpose of this report is to show the subjects which I have been comfortable with and the subjects which have been difficult for me, furthermore, to explain what I am going to do to achieve my goals. In general, few students enjoy mathematics and physics. This is not the case with arts because almost all of them love it. They appear to be difficult, however, mathematics and physics are easier than you could think. You only need to know the rules and the formulas and that is it. Most students seem to enjoy learning a new language, the classes are fun and interactive. Last year, English class was taught by an excellent teacher, but the problem has always been listening and speaking. It's difficult because an hour is not enough to practise it. The best solution seems to be to have tutorials with a private teacher or take an extra English course in a language school. Moreover, I recommend practising for yourself, watching movies, finding a native English speaker, and practicing every day. Remember that practice makes perfect.

Compared with the television broadcasts in other countries, like the United Kingdom or the USA, Italian television is very young. During its first decade, Italian television had, as its first aim, an educational role. Indeed in the 50s more than half of the Italian population was not educated and they did not speak Italian, but they spoke dialects. RAI, the national television broadcaster, had programs to help schools with teaching the Italian language, history, civics, etc. RAI had its educational role until the 80s, when it changed its aim to compete with private broadcasters. In that decade, entertainment overtook the educational role, and, unfortunately, it began to have a bad influence on the audience. In the last few decades, the national broadcaster has tried to come back to its educational role, even with very small projects. Today, we watch new television channels that have cultural and educational aims.

In my opinion, learning a new language is always significant. If you learn a new language you can have some opportunities. For instance, some companies work with establishments from different countries and they need an intermediary to communicate with them. They can pay a good amount of money for that. There are a lot of chances if you learn a language. You can teach students in a language academy if you know the language you teach well. So, when we learn a language, we can communicate with foreign people or we can find a job. On the other hand, we could visit some country for a different purpose. When we do this, we should learn a language when we go to the country. If we do a course like a master's or doctorate, we should learn academic language. To sum up, learning a language takes time, but it's significant, no matter when.

When you are young you don't care about doing exercise because you think that it isn't important for your life, but most young people are wrong about that. Exercise is very important for our health because it helps us with everything in our body. Besides being good for our mind. Usually when you have a problem or you are very stressed with something that happened and you do exercise your mood changes at the same time. Therefore, it is so important for our life to do any kind of exercise every single day . But there are other things that are good for us, like eating healthy foods and drinking water a lot because when we have a good feeding our body feels happier and willing to do new things like going out with our friends or doing a hike. So these two things are very important for our health. I would like to say that maybe these things work better together.

The best holiday ever One of the best places that you could visit is without doubt Queretaro, there are many beautiful natural places. Moreover, you can go with your family, friends, and also you could take your pets with you. For this reason, for our holidays we chose the Sierra Gorda Queretana and San Luis. The whole way to these places was awesome and the villages were too, where you can eat traditional dishes and buy handicrafts. However, the most awesome places I’ve ever visited are “The half moon and Bridge of god”, where you can swim, camp, and take walks. There's a long walk to get to the Bridge; my family and I took it. I took lots of pictures, but I couldn’t swim because the weather was cold. I have good memories about that holiday because I was with my grandparents and my best friend, who hated the walk by the river, but loved spending time with me. In conclusion, the places gave a special touch to my holidays because I learned the most important thing was to spend time with people that I loved. I’m excited about the next place where we could have a terrific time again.

In my opinion, the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants should have limited access because it disturbs the public concentration and also the dealing person of a particular person. I have two chief reasons to support my view which I wish to explore in this essay. Firstly , nowadays mobile use is very generalised and most people don't know the proper way to handle a mobile and it is a big issue not only for the mobile user but also the people who are around the user. As we know, nowadays public life is very busy with work hence people have limited time, or we can say not sufficient time, for their public work and in that case if he spends extra time because of one's disturbance or due to another person who is talking on their mobile at the time of payment or at the time of negotiating, in that case only extra time is consumed by the customer because of his mobile call. Safety is a main concern in public places. Sometimes people have an accident at the time of entering the bus because they are busy on a phone call, not seeing the vigilent to foot rest and it is a very common type of bus accident due to unaware use of a mobile. Further to this , on long journeys people usually read in public transport and in that case if someone is busy on a mobile call and talking loudly that person just disturbing the other passengers.

May I present you with this new website I recently discovered. It is Write&improve. This website provides a tool for improving your writing on your own. It is even usable for beginners, like people who have just started to learn English, as much as for some more advanced English speakers. The site offers plenty of topics and forms to write about. You can choose freely what you like to write about or can. Then you can start to write. As soon as you finish, a really great thing starts, you can get instant feedback for your writing, which points out all your mistakes and marks them as well. But that is not all. It also shows you your current language level, and lets you improve your written text. You can check after every change if it makes your text better, so you can slowly increase your skill by thinking of ways to improve your writing even further. The only downside is that it does not provide suggestions to replace the wrong parts of your writing, which makes kinda hard for not so experienced writers, because they can't think of another way to express themselves. So this would be a huge upgrade for the future.

Two years ago, I had an unhealthy life; exercise was not an option to me . Also, I had a lot of work at university; my free time was spent with my friends. However, when I started to have health problems, I decided to change my lifestyle. For this reason, I took the decision to practise a sporting activity, moreover, I changed my eating habits as well. I’ve tried to do different kinds of exercise, like workout, cardio, running, and so on. I haven’t stopped because my health is better, I feel stronger, more flexible, and more resistant. Some people feel like there are more important things, such as watching TV and going to a party. Contrary to this, I have to say that there are no things more important than doing physical activity, because exercise helps you to have good health and that has to be the most important thing for you. To sum up, adding any kind of exercise to your lifestyle will be the best decision. There are many options of things to do, just search for the activity to fit into your life and then you will be able to notice the changes in your health, you, you will feel happier.

Despite some minuses of changing studying materials for some students, it is vital to sit and study anything you want by using true material. I based my idea on two reasons. First and foremost, provided that you acquire the most beneficial material to learn something, you can most probably learn it. I mean, the better material you use, the more information you get. For instance, since I started to use a tool called "Write&Improve," my improvement in English has become excellent. It helps me broaden my vocabulary while writing essays. Secondly, it is unfair to be failed on exams even though you study a lot. Nevertheless, when you prepare exams with improper materials, the foregone conclusion will be unsuccessfulness. Thanks to that Write&Improve application, I can manage to enhance not only my writing but also vocabulary skills. According to the recent statistics, there are many unhappy students who need some guides to find the most correct tools in order to learn English. All in all, there is no need to waste our precious time with useless tools. Students should be more aware of their own skills and improve them via that Write&Improve tool. Additionally, more advertisements of that tool on the internet might be more helpful for students who try to find it there.

Write and Improve is a writing tool for learners of English. It's a free online tool that allows you to write about many different subjects and get your essay corrected in just a few seconds. In addition, you can check your mistakes and rewrite your essay as many times as you want in order to improve your writing skills. Despite my short time using this tool, I'd like to point out some things about it. Firstly, I think it's a very useful tool, because the tool algorithm doesn't take much time to get the essay corrected. In other words, the tool user can improve his essay faster than if it were with a teacher, thus the learning process becomes more dynamic. However, it should be noted that the corrections shown by the tool are not always perfect and some mistakes may not be highlighted. That is, sometimes, the algorithm shows no mistakes in the essay, but it does not mean that it's perfect. In conclusion, Write and Improve is a tool that gives just a superficial correction of your essay. Finally, I highly recommend this tool to improve your writing skills, but it's important to remember that these skills can always be improved even if the tool doesn't point out any mistakes.

Ever since humanity was born and landed on this planet, this question has always been asked, yet nobody can give a definite answer. It is like the mystery of the black hole: you can't know it unless you enter it, but you can't say it once you enter it. The question is nonetheless the famous question of which is better, a long, calm life until 100 years old or a shorter life but much more intense. I couldn't say that my answer will be the right answer but I would prefer to live a long calm life, because if you are surrounded with things and people you love there is no need for intense things to happen. This is because having them beside you will be the most satisfactory feeling you will experience. However, I see why some people would prefer to have a short yet intense life because they feel that life is not calculated by how long you lived but by what you experienced. I agree with that but life is something very strange. You will never have a formula to calculate how good is one's life. For some, the same experience might have a different mark. So, in my opinion, I prefer having a long yet calm life rather than a short but intense life. However, I respect everyone's opinion. Peace and love.

Schools have been playing an important role in the development of mankind for centuries. However, schools will be changing in some aspects like society has always been developed. I believe schools still provide educational environments where people come to acquire their knowledge, but with the development of technology, they might be transferred from physical places to online institutions, which could be more convenient and affordable. On the one hand, what will never be changed is that schools still provide learning spaces for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Also, schools are where experts in many fields gather with the dedication to share their knowledge. On the other hand, schools will have to emerge to adapt to a changing society. Nowadays, people are busy and not everyone has time to go to a physical school so that the demand to learn remotely is pretty clear. Many schools will have to set up online programs to meet that demand. With the development of technology, moving online is not very difficult. Teachers and students can interact with each other without meeting in person. That kind of education is not only flexible but also convenient and cheap. To conclude, I think schools will be playing their role as they used to do, but online education will be popular in the future

Dear Billal, Thank you for your email yesterday. I'm happy that you passed the last exam and you were able to fly with friends to Africa to your aunt. I can't wait for when you will show me photos and films from a trip. How long are you planning to stay there? Write to me, please, when you have landed. I was with my school friends on a trip in Warsaw. We started from Radomsko at about 7 a.m. and three hours later we were already in our capital. We parked near the old city so we could go sightseeing at Kings Castle and Column Zygmunt III Waza. From the old city we could see amazing views, especially of the National Stadium. In the old city we spent about three hours. Our teacher prepared creative trial games and we had to search for many places and talk with other people. What is your favourite place in the old city in our capital, Billal? At 12.00 we could hear the Warsaw anthem from the tower clock of Kings Castle. I recorded it, if you want I can send you this incredible video. I heard an anthem in Cracow when we visited this city last year. Sounds great! At 2 p.m. our teacher organized an appointment with a non-government organization - Polish Foundation of Schuman. Volunteers told us about many projects, events and happenings, for example: Schuman Parade. I love this event! I have been to Schuman Parade a lot of times, I met many pro European young people. We discussed the future of the European Union, and Poland's place and position in the EU. What do you think about the future of the EU, Billal? Are you thinking that the EU should be more united and new countries have access or not? Returning to my trip to Warsaw. After an appointment with NGO's, we had lunch. Two hours later we went for a walk in the Kings Bathrooms. You don't believe me, Billal! We met the President of Warsaw here! We were able to take photos with him and talk about important matters of our country. I have recorded when he greeted our school! You should see it! We got back to Radomsko at 9 p.m., tired on the last leg but we were happy! Billal, I'm happy and enjoyed my trip. Every activity was amazing. It was a great time! Write to me quickly, please! Warm regards, Elizabeth.

Hardly one week goes by without an article about an adventurous person who is trying or managed to break a record in sports or in any other competitive area. Who is the best, the richest, the fastest or the most beautiful one? It seems that these successes mark the new standard which we should be able to achieve, if we work hard enough and dream big enough. Characteristically for this approach, is also the trend of self-help books and videos with catchy titles such as "how to be successful in one month" or "how to get rich in only one year." Those titles attract customers who have a self-impression of not being sufficient. The normal life has transformed to "the life you had before you lived the better life." Personally, I would like to live a nice regular life and pass my 100 years reading or walking through summer forests. Intensity should not be mistakenly seen as happiness. To live an enjoyable life is a myriad challenge, if not the greatest of all. During my 100 years I will have to overcome many hurdles which make some days less bright than others, but in the end I will look back to my summer forest walks and the many books I will have read and the many inspiring conversations, and surely not think about how boring it was.

Firstly, I think some university students decide to move away in order to be more independent and to start to live on their own. That is, these students want to have more privacy and more control of their own lives. According to some research, these students may be more prepared when they have to live without parents' support. In other words, they might deal better with adulthood. However, it all depends on how the parents have raised their children and consequently how the students will deal with the university environment. Another key fact to remember is that the university environment is not always pleasant and sometimes it can be traumatic for some people due to prank calls, low support and other things. In conclusion, there is no universal answer for the question about students moving away when they go to university. To put it more simply, there is no common better choice, because it must be decided in each situation.

I have already used Write and Improve to practise my English writing for one year. And I think this software is really good for one to improve one's English writing. First, it provides me with many topics to choose from. I was always confused about what to write and had to spend some time to think about it. Now I can just choose one from the list that I want to write about that time. Second, it can revise my grammar errors. After many years of finishing school, I have forgotten a lot of the grammar I learned before. So it's good that Write and Improve revises this for me. Lastly, there are also some drawbacks. Sometimes, when I modify something several times but still can't get better grades, I would like it to provide me with some sentence examples. If it could do that, I should think it's wonderful software for learning English.

I think it is better for students to have the same teacher for several years. Students and teachers all need time to become familiar with each other. There is a period for each other to adapt. If students change teachers every year, they will be always spending time on the same thing. For teachers, it's important to know the ability, character, and personality of all students. With this information, teachers can then use proper methods to teach different types of students. For students who lack confidence in their ability, the teacher might create attainable goals. For students who lack interest in studies, the teacher might use interesting ways to make it fun. There is one proverb, 'Teach students according to their aptitude'. For students, it takes time to adapt to the teaching style of a teacher. Some teachers focus on the class communication, while others focus on the homework. Students usually perform better after they are used to the schedule. That's why I think it's a better way for students to have the same teacher for several years.

Nowadays we have two groups of people. People from one group prefer to lead a calm life, in small cities, where they can find peace. They try to avoid stress so they live longer. At the same time the other one chooses to have an intense life, with loads of changes, it provides their lives with loads of fun and joy. Nevertheless, changes are related to stress, what might be one of the reasons for premature death. Living a long and calm life might be a dream for lots of people. Even though following businesses and careers is popular nowadays, some people prefer to lead their lives in a different way. They prefer to spend time in a loving community, with their families. They tend to choose light jobs and mostly they enjoy little things. However, sometimes those people might become bored with their routines and be unhappy. Living an intense life might be a good choice for some people, but for the others it could be overwhelming. I think enjoying each of the days and not being bored is a domain of people who have an intense life. By doing something they love, they fulfill their passions and dreams. Nevertheless, in some cases a high pace of life might lead to stress and disorders that might interfere with plans of living a long life. Taking everything into consideration I think I would choose to live longer without loads of stress, because I'm a calm person who likes being healthy.

School is one of the most important steps in people's life and it must be good for everyone. For this reason, I think that changing teachers every year is one of the worst things that school has. In fact, with the same teacher students can follow a complete educational path that also includes a complete educational path that includes also a straight school program. When a new teacher arrives, he has to check the knowledge of the class and, in general, he must repeat plenty of things because he doesn't know what the students have studied or what the previous teacher's method was. It's also true that changing teachers could be good to avoid bad professors, but with an efficient school system and prepared teachers students can really benefit from it with a consequent increase of their preparation and general knowledge and the establishment of a great empathy with who could be one of the most influential people in a student's life.

In my opinion, video games represent a great hobby for children, but they must be limited. As with everything, they have good and bad things. In fact, they are not a useless thing because, according to some studies, they can help children improve their skills and intelligence. And they are also instructive for them because there are several games, such as games with a story line or a plot based on mythology or history, which can help children increase their knowledge, their interests, and educate them about important values like love, respect, or bravery, too. Obviously they also have negative things, such as inappropriate games for people under eighteen years old or the ease with which the gaming community can be accessed. The latter can be a good thing but, for children, it can also be dangerous, especially without a parent's supervision which could avoid any type of cyber-bullying. So, I think video games are a great instrument for children, but hey must be used wisely.

The future of travel Do you ever wonder about the future of travel? I’ve always imagined how technology could change the ways to travel around the world. It’s why I did some research about its current progress. Firstly, the ways in which we travel have changed dramatically. Transport such as by airplane and boat is faster and cheaper. Another thing is the fact that if you want to discover other places you'll be able to do it through virtual tours, though we'll be able to do space travel. On the other hand, the attractions will be the same, throughout the years people always want to visit the same places, pyramids, museums, archaeological sites, and so on. Other things to consider are that unexpected trip cancellations, delays, and emergencies will continue to occur. In conclusion, people think that in the future it will be easier to travel, almost everyone will be able to pay for a trip, and space trips will be a possibility. But we must be aware that there will be situations regarding travel that won’t change and cannot be avoided, like bad weather or technical problems.

In my view, keeping animals in nature is the best thing to do, because all animals need to breathe and feel nature. It is their nature, they need to live in their natural habitat to survive. The natural habitat of humans is being together with a family or some other humans. We survive having conversations and interactions with other humans and exchanging experiences. It is necessary for us to have a good life with everyone. Although it is a good idea to have animals in zoos, because they will always have food and a good place to sleep, and have offspring too, but is wrong leave they arrested. The best way about that, is if we just keep animals that got hurt and were rescued. In this case, I think it is safe and health of animals stay some time in zoos and after release to nature, and never keep brokenin the cage. If kids and teens want to learn about animals, they can search on the internet.

First of all, music is a wonderful thing that a lot of people around the world love. Many schools give their students music sessions but others do not give them. I really don't think these differences are good. I love listening to music but not playing it so a student like me doesn't need a music session so now we have to find a solution. Now we could give every student a paper that asks him if he wants to take the music session or not. The students who need it could take it but the others would have a free session with the metron or they could practise any subject they want. Another solution is changing the form of the music session , for example, we could separate it into two halves, the first one will be for listening and singing if the students want to. The second half will be for playing music but the students who don't want to can go to their class. All in all, schools shouldn't have differences in music sessions a long d or make students do what they don't like.

First of all, I believe we will change the way travel because of COVID. For this, I will try to explain below. On the one hand, I consider that you will be able to go anywhere in the world as long as you have a vaccination passport. I think that vaccines will be obligatory. Therefore, if you do not have vaccinations you cannot enter. I am sure that the countries themselves will take care of who enters and if it is legal or not. This will be for the common good. On the other hand, I think that the way of travelling in Spain is changing. Spanish people will travel in Spain and they will discover amazing new places. It is true that the economy will change. Because of this, Spain should learn and improve and create new activities to be productive. Only in this way will Spain be able to create wealth.

In my opinion, during the time zoos are becoming dangerous for the environment. In fact, in the last century, the environment has been damaged too much by pollution and by the destruction of green zones. For this reason, zoos represent a dangerous way of altering the natural habitats of animals which have, during recent years, become lower in numbers. I think animals must be free of any type of artificial jails that carry only the destruction of the normal life in nature. I think that in our digital era, animals can be studied and people can learn also through documentaries and innovative ways, such as videos or through virtual reality. Maybe somebody can say that zoos are useful to preserve the animals that are at risk of extinction, but I think that they are wrong, because zoos were only made for human's entertainment, without any consideration for animals' needs. So, animals at risk can be supervised in a specific area that is limited but preserves their natural habitat. In conclusion, I can say that a world without zoos could be a better world.

In my opinion, studying abroad is one of the best features of school. In fact, in our world, which is always very globalized, international experiences are really important for students that will be the future of society. In this way, they also have the possibility to visit new countries and meet people all around the world, also meeting different cultures and different ideas which, for me, can open their minds to the entire world. For didactic aims, these projects are useful to accelerate a language study or improving students' skills. But, I can say that these projects could be very difficult for shy people or people that are not fit for this type of experience, which could be one of the most difficult parts of their life. On the other hand, this experience can be also helpful for them because it can give the possibility to go beyond these limits and become a better person. In conclusion, I think that studying abroad is a great experience that can only carry benefits to the people that will be able to enjoy it.

The reason is simple, working in cities will help them earn a lot of money. This is because the government are more likely to focus on upgrading facilities in cities rather than in rural areas. Systematically, this will make medical facilities in rural areas hard to be accessed by the community. And the impact is medical treatment will not be in demand in rural areas. This causes no balance between the salary for working in cities and in rural areas. This can be solved by the government themselves with the community's support. We have to raise the voice of rural areas' people to remind the government that they exist. By doing this, we hope the government can be more concerned about facilities and medical development in rural areas, so their economy will also develop. And medical facilities will be more accessible for the rural community, and then medical doctors will be in demand and will create a balance of salary between working in cities and in rural areas. Despite this problem, medical doctors should not choose their workplace based on salary. Yet, they should consider being the hero in places that need medical treatment, but hardly accessible.

I am very excited about this new school year! During the last summer I studied to be prepared for this moment and I'm ready to start. In general, I really like mathematics, physics, and English, which are my favourite subjects. I think that maths is my passion because I enjoy studying it and, in my opinion, it is very interesting. On the other hand, I really like physics because it gives me the possibility to understand how our world works and I think that's incredible. Then, English is a beautiful language for its phonetics and for the culture that is related to it. So, I would like to improve my knowledge about these three subjects, which are, for me, the most important subjects for my future. During this year I'm going to study hard but enjoy studying at the same time, in order to give my one hundred percent and over, and, of course, to achieve my goals for school.

Two years ago, I went on holiday to the USA, in particular to New York. I think it was the best experience I ever had. First of all, I spent one week there, arriving there in June. While I was arriving at my hotel, I could see the magnificent city that New York was and still is. There was a particular atmosphere, very different from my own country. When I arrived, the receptionist was very friendly and, after the check-in, I went up to my room to leave my things. After that, I went to Central Park, which was very close to my hotel, where I was completely blinded by the magnificent place that it was. Here, there was a student group that invited me to join them and, after a few hours walking through the park, they guided me towards the city. There, they showed me the delicious restaurants of New York and beautiful places, such as the famous Statue of Liberty and the iconic Wall Street. After a few days I had to leave, but it was the best holiday of my life because in New York I met the people that are, nowadays, my best friends.

Today, my class have had a discussion on the importance of exercise. In my opinion, exercise is one of the most important things in our life. That is, as important as activities, like eating or drinking water. In fact, without regular exercise, we can't lead a healthy life, which has consequences for other activities too. For example, we can't work without a healthy body nor study without a healthy regular life. I think that people ignore the benefits of physical activity, which are very important for our lives, too much. Over the years, studies have shown that exercise gives the possibility to reduce stress and has a great impact on several factors, like tranquillity and focus. For these reasons, people should include exercise between the most important activities they do every day, dedicating one or two hours to it. I think that this routine won't only carry the benefits previously explained, but also lets people enjoy themselves much more.

First of all, video games can be bad for children because if they do not play a game at the age recommended for the game it can be a problem. For example, the game " Grand Theft Auto " is recommended for people over 18, and has violence, drugs, and nudity and it is inappropriate for teens to watch this thing. It is not a good time to see that. Games are not a motivation for teens to do bad things, but everything that a kid or teen sees on TV or whatever, they want to imitate. Because in their head, the main character is a hero, and a teen wants to be a person like him, and sometimes the game is not coherent about that, it is a bad thing. Nowadays, there are a lot of educational games to help and motivate to study other languages, and help in them school, which is awesome.

Both choices have their own pros and cons. Moving away from family might seem like living in freedom, interesting and exciting, yet the reality is not like we expected. We have to manage ourselves to live healthily and organized. Otherwise, we will not be able to do well in our study programme and could cause our grades to collapse. But as we usually know, the pro is we will have more freedom to explore anything we want. We also can use this opportunity to practise living alone for the future, because we cannot live with our parents forever. Living with family while attending university is great for those who wants to focus on studying. Our family can keep our needs in control, so we do not need to worry about our economy nor our daily needs. But watch out, we cannot have such freedom as if we are living on our own. I prefer to live on my own because this whole life is about challenge and experiences. I think by moving away and living on my own, I could explore more things and enjoy the transition of my life. I believe that I could manage things well and will not cause any disruption to my academic studies.

What is more important: health or wealth? Different people have different answers to this critical question. Every day, we see people sacrifice sleep in order to work extra hard and secure monetary gains. We also see people spend their hard-earned money to treat a disease that has caused them a lot of pain. There seems to be a cycle of prioritizing wealth and then realizing that what is important is health after a person feels unwell. In my opinion, money is very important particularly in the current competitive world, but it is just a means to an end, not an end; what people should aim for is living a healthy life which is free from sickness. To begin with, one's happiness is not fully dependent on whether one has money or not, but it is clearly about not experiencing chronic pain, either mentally or physically. It is true that sometimes having money can alleviate the pain, but it could also cause the pain. To illustrate, think of affluent people. Compared to the average person, they experience a lot of stress and worry due to the possibility of losing their wealth. Moreover, they need to put in additional effort to sustain what they have accumulated over the years. From this example, it seems that not owning much has its benefits.

What are my reasons for learning English? I had to think about this question while I was studying English because I felt that I was losing my motivation and not performing as I should. After thinking, I found that I study English for the following reasons. First, I want to learn English because I need to access the massive content written in that language. As we all know, English is the most spoken language in the world, and in this language a large content, such as books, movies, etc., has been produced. By being able to read and understand English, I can easily consume the information and learn from it and that will greatly help me succeed in my life. Second, English has become the language of business, and anyone who wants to do business on a global scale has to learn it. Due to the development of transportation methods and communication, it has become possible to trade with other organizations from different countries, and for successful interaction, there must be a common language between the two parties. English happens to be that language. In the end, people could learn English for various reasons. For me, I noticed that there are a lot of materials written in English that interest me. Additionally, I would like to be able to communicate with international businesses.

An old Chinese curse states: may you live in interesting times. We definitely all live in interesting times now. Everything changed in 2019 when the corona virus pandemic started. We will face the consequences for a long time. How will they affect our ways of travelling? One thing is certain: it will not be the same. First of all, in 2021 we may still be forced to focus on domestic trips. Before the roll out of the vaccine there will be obstacles to cross the borders. I expect that the situation may go back to normality in early 2022. Secondly, the costs of plane tickets may rise dramatically. A lot of airlines went bust and those that continue operating may be forced to cut losses. Apart from that, even before the pandemic, some people claimed that we shouldn't use planes because of the environmental issues. Does that mean that we will stay at home? I don't think so. Maybe we will switch to electric cars and trains? We will see soon.

Poland is a country where we struggle to improve the health system. A lot of things have changed but there are still a lot to do. One of the most serious issues is lack of medical doctors in rural areas. They usually prefer to work in big agglomerations or even go abroad to countries like Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. What is the reason for this situation? In my opinion, the main cause is the salary. In rural areas doctors usually earn less than those who work in big cities. Secondly, life in rural areas is less interesting. Doctors study at universities which are located in big cities and they are used to the hustle and bustle. Living in a small village may seem very boring at first glance. What can be done about this? I believe there are several options possible. First of all, our government should raise the salaries of doctors who decided to move to remote area of the country. Secondly, there should be investments made in the infrastructure. Fast trains and good roads would allow fast travel.

I have watched many films in the past, and I have a few that I prefer more than others. If I have to choose one to be my favorite, it would be Leon the Professional. It was filmed in the 90s in New York City and has an unusual and interesting story that made it the top of my list of favorite movies. The movie begins in an apartment building in one of New York's neighbourhoods, and in it there is a family that hardly can be called a family. There is frequent shouting and arguments; nobody gets along with others. It is not surprising when it becomes known that the father is involved in illegal activities with criminals and corrupt police men. One day, the corrupt policemen invade the building and break into the apartment. They search every room in the apartment looking for drugs that they have given to the father. As soon as they learn that he does not have the drugs, everyone is murdered without mercy, even a small child. Right before the policemen arrive in front of the building, a young girl, who is about 8 years old, has just left her troubled family to get a break from all the negative energy and also to get some milk. She is lucky, but she still needs to return to her family. She has no other place to go. While she is entering the building, she feels that something is wrong. She can hear noise that is not familiar. She continues cautiously, and when she approaches the door of her apartment, there is a well-built man carrying a machine gun. Frightened, she does not stop and continues walking straight past her apartment door; she peeks and sees her father on the floor covered in blood. She knows what happened, but tries her best not to show any emotion, or she will also be killed. While walking, a door blocks her way. It is the door of a neighbour's apartment. After a moment of hesitation, she knocks on the door a few times and waits for rescue. As she is losing hope of escaping that tough situation, the door opens. She feels like it is the door of heaven. It is Leon, who opened the door, a professional hitman. He has been watching the whole event and knows what happened to her family. He saved her, but he is now responsible for her as she has nobody. How could a hitman take care of a child whose entire family was just murdered? You need to watch the movie to see what happens afterwards.

A great number of university students live far from home and live independently. However, other ones live at home with their family members. I am of opinion that students who live far from home have a greater chance to develop their soft skills, and this essay will outline a couple of reasons. To begin with, living independently has been commonly regarded as an essential element in a person's development because of its beneficial impacts on other aspects in a person. A student living far from home must adapt to their surroundings by expanding a wide range of relationships with other counterparts and getting used to a series of unexpected situations revolving around mainly financial burdens. The practical experience helps make the student stronger and confident not only in school life but also at a societal level. Besides, the university period offers students, especially those who live far from home, numerous wonderful opportunities, like either getting a part-time job or being involved in a voluntary campaign, to develop their soft skills including presentations and team-working, which are really essential after graduation. Without time restriction by their parents, a student living far from home at university could spend hours hanging out or studying in a group with other students which helps bridge the gap between them and constitutes long-standing relationships that might last for decades. In conclusion, although university students living independently face numerous emerging situations due to the lack of their relatives, this also offers multiple amazing chances. Having part-time jobs and acquiring long-standing relationships helps the students become mature.

Firstly, I think that volunteer work should be a requirement to graduate in all schools, because there are several benefits of this type of activity. For example, it's an opportunity to learn about new subjects, including things outside of your social environment. In addition, some American research from Michingan University stated that people who practice volunteer work live about four years more. Similarly, other research proved that volunteer workers have a better balance between their professional and personal lives and, consequently, less stress and more positive energy. Despite the fact that many people say it's a waste of time, volunteer work can change people's minds in a good way by making them more sensitive and, therefore, they understand social problems better. In conclusion, a certain amount of volunteer work can be very helpful in order to develop students as human beings better, because that is also included in the school missions.

Technological development is our present and it will be our future. For this reason, it will surely influence the way we travel in the future, hoping that it will make it better. For years experts and engineers have focused their knowledge and capacity on artificial intelligence that will lead the world's logistics in the future. One of the most important examples is the automatic drive (or smart drive) which is the idea (and actually the present) of automatic cars and vehicles. This technology will not only change our own vehicles, but will change public transport too. In fact, in the next few years, we will probably be able to find automatic cabs or buses that won't need a driver, making transports more efficient and quicker. On the other hand, also private cars will have the possibility to be driven by a specific automatic system which will make streets safer than now and reduce risks related to driving.

The school of the future Have you ever thought about how schools will be in the future? As a teacher, I’ve always wondered what schools will be like in the future. The world is in constant change: medicine, communications, and education have been changed as well, and we know that the education system needs to be innovated. Firstly, with new technologies and the internet, everyone has easy access to information, in consequence, teachers will no longer be the only source of information, so they will become a guide. Secondly, skills such a public speaking will be more important than academic knowledge. However, skills won't supplant academic preparation and you will still have to learn mathematics, science, or history. Then professional certifications will be important, but never as important as an academic degree. To sum up, the educational system needs to link to the needs of a changing society. We have more access to information and we can learn thing on our own, but a professional degree and help of professors will always be important and essential.

As far as I am concerned, schools will change a lot for the reason of some situations such as diseases. In addition, I should have mentioned technology too. Nowadays, education is run through schools. Constantly students are taught by teachers. Thus, the students create their attitudes, personality, and lifestyles for their future life. If they are successful, their success will be beneficial and a huge convenience for them.,. the students will take up online lessons. However, first of all it will be hard to learn and many children won't adapt immediately. They haven't had lessons like that before. Therefore, they are not capable of understanding everything clearly. Besides, they won't manage to do their duties easily. Governments are recommended to supply requirements such as computers. Technological devices must be given to poor kids by the government because many children don't have adequate money to afford online education. Consequently, in my opinion, the schools will change deeply. Although the schools change their style, the requirements mustn't be ignored. Students are such a tremendous, exceptional people that we mustn't forget to consider them.

In my opinion, in the future schools will follow the technological development that is characterizing our world nowadays. I imagine a totally digital school, where books will be replaced by computers and everything will be faster than now. Schools could become smart facilities fitted for a didactic aim, with digital features or digital functions which will be useful for students. For example, there could be digital courses mixed with normal courses, or more specific didactics that will teach how to use robots or how to work with them. So, I think over the years students will be smarter and more competent than now, so there will be a greater society. On the other hand, I think that some things will be the same as now. For example, school will still include the human contact between students, and teachers won't be completely replaced by computers or robots in order to make schools contain a human aspect.

To begin with, I am going to talk about whether I believe that television can entertain as well as educate. On the one hand, I consider that television should be more educational because it is possible that some type of programme can distort reality. Younger people believe that it is possible to earn money by doing anything. On the other hand, I consider that nowadays television is changing, especially with the programmes . For example, there is a new show called "El condesador de Fluzo" and I think it is perfect for understanding history or discovering new things. Besides, who go to the show explain historical event very well. In this show there are writers, comedians, and historians of all kinds. To sum up, I would like to say that I really think that television is changing for the better. Especially for young people that do not fall into stereotypes.

In my opinion, television is a good vehicle for education, but it is often wasted for that aim. In fact, there are programs that could be very misleading for young people, which could give a bad vision of the world, such as gossip programs or violent cartoons and series, but also programs that include bad language that could influence the people that watch it. On the other hand, television has great features that could make it great for education, such as the news, film channels, sports channels, and so on. But I think that nowadays people are looking for something different from television. For example, people prefer using digital sites and their features to search for something that they don't know, learn new languages, or discover new things every day. In conclusion, I think that television is a valid educational vehicle, but it will be replaced by digitalization soon.

There are fewer and fewer places for animals to live on earth now. It's a natural trend when the population of people is growing. Unless we can control our population and the resources well, it is really hard to reserve many places for animals. Under these conditions, I think zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Although it might be cruel for these animals since they lose their freedom. But if zoos can provide proper care for these animals, they might not feel so bad in a zoo. At least, like people, some like to work hard and some like to take a rest. I think it should be similar for animals. Without the zoos, many animals might disappear from Earth in a few years. In contrast, zoos can help to keep some of these animal from disappearing due to the population, farming, and deforestation destroying natural habitats. One day, when most people learn to respect nature and can live with animals, we can set these animals free into nature.

My reasons for learning English Nowadays, more and more non-native speakers have learned and mastered English due to different reasons. Most of them have done it for their studies or work. On average, most of them have learned English in their childhood. When I was a child, I also learned English in school. However, learning English in a Chinese school is primarily focusing on passing the exam, not on mastering the language in daily life or work. Therefore, I still need to improve my spoken and written English. And there are several reasons for it. Firstly, I need to master English for my master program since all my finance courses are held in English. And in two months, I must write my master thesis in English as well. Secondly, I need it for job seeking. Since the finance segment is very international, job seekers must speak and write English and German very well, even in Germany. Thirdly, according to my experience, when I master English, I can communicate with my children in English and help them learn English at an early age. So they will not have the same problems that I suffer now.

A concert you went to Hey Kim, How are you doing? I have missed you very much. We should meet again. Last week, I went to a music concert with my boyfriend in Berlin. We had so much fun, and I want to share it with you. It was an open-air concert by Andrea Bocelli, an Italian tenor and multi-instrumentalist. Many of his famous songs were performed in the show, such as Time to say goodbye, The prayer, Quizás, Quizás, Quizás, etc. Even at the end of the concert, Andrea Bocelli sang three extra songs to thank his music fans. Furthermore, one interesting thing I found is that we were some of the youngest fans. Most members of the audience were older than 50 years old.

There is no doubt that earning money is crucial in our life to meet our life's necessities and being healthy is crucial for doing your daily jobs and chores. Money comes and goes, while health is a treasure. In some cases health may not get back after some permanent diseases. Moreover, a sound mind can lead you to more than wealth, and to have a sound mind you should have a healthy body. People who care about their health can enjoy their time with their family and their children, without complaining of any pain. Furthermore healthy people may live longer than those who suffer from illnesses. Not having any disease is a reasonable motivation to tend to care about health more than wealth, since having a disease may cause permanent pains, which will be an obstacle for many to eat freely, or go to some places, or do hobbies, or even move, while a healthy person doesn't have to care about any of these eventually.

I don't agree with the idea that computers and tablets will completely replace books in schools and universities. I have two reasons to support this idea. First, there is a lot of information in books which is held in schools' libraries. Indeed, you can access what you want to know immediately with your computer these days. You can easily obtain the information online. However, the quantity and quality of the information in books are greater than that on the internet. Besides, most of the online information has not been reviewed by any other person. Thus, the precision of the information is not guaranteed. If you are a university student, it is good for you to find the information in a library. You can open a new world through many books. Secondly, there is an advantage that you can write down anything and save it in your book. If you find some information online, you cannot write something on the website. To understand what you want to know, writing is a crucial factor because the movement of your fingers accelerates your working memory in the brain. By writing something in a book, you can gain a deeper understanding of the matter. For your studies during university life, it is important to recognize things deeply, because research activities need a lot of knowledge. To sum up, books are required in universities to make students understand things deeply.

In my opinion, the workspace configuration is significantly important to increase efficiency in work. When the offices have a more open design, it can distract the employees more. On the other hand, office partitions provide privacy and sophistication, besides improving the workspace organization. In spite of the fact that an open design office is known as a more modern concept, some American research stated that many employees have difficulties in concentrating on work, therefore it's essential to reduce distractions in workspace in order to increase efficiency. Moreover, there are other things which can similarly improve efficiency in work, such as lighting, temperature, table height, chair comfort and many other characteristics of the office. In conclusion, enclosed workstations are the most effective type of arrangement, because there are fewer distractions and, consequently, less wasted work time. In addition, some other improvements in the office can be made to increase efficiency, as exemplified previously.

Most people are pursuing their dreams to be rich, but not many people take care of their health. You can say money is what our lives are all about; however, I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. First of all, having physical or mental diseases prevents you from being happy even though you are rich. Our goals and dreams stand on the foundation of being happy. If you had a million dollars and severe disease, your money would lose its value because you might not have enough time to spend all of it, and even more, you would want to spend it to cure your disease. That means health is more valuable than money. Whether you are rich or not, you can still be happy having your loved one or a successful career. But without being healthy, you end up being unhappy.

Indeed, video games are very popular with children. I can say that I also played video games when I was teenager. I can´t support that children play video games because they get very distracting and it is very difficult to focus on the important things. There is no end and you can play video games for hours. You are also missing a lot of things, you will stay the whole time at your home and you won't leave your place. It is very important to do any sport and physically activities. Furthermore, you maybe have some social interactions with friends while playing video games, but I would say that it is different meeting people in reality than only just when playing games. You can't control it, which makes it so difficult. Children are getting very familiar with a computer, gaming networks, and with children with the same preferences. In the end, I can't recommend it, particularly for young children. On the other hand, there are also a lot of good examples of teenager who have spent a lot of time on video gaming and nowadays are successfully and working in this field.

I have been using the Write and Improve website since last year. So far my experience with Write and Improve has been good. This website has been helping me every day to improve my English skill. The tasks are intuitive and you easily understand what you have to do in each activity. I like the feedback section best, where I can check what I did wrong and I can fix my mistakes using the tips of this section. The section "Your progress" is very interesting too. There you can follow your improvement after you do a task again, and check if you are getting better or not. I don't like the limited space for writing because we have to reduce the amount of words. I believe it can impact the quality of the text. I strongly recommend Write and Improve to my classmates.

One question is about whether having different teachers is good or not, and I am gonna answer the question. I am a student right now and I think I have a real answer for the question. This has two sides, a good and a bad one. The good side of having different teachers is that we can open our vision about the subject we are studying. On the other hand we can find the teachers that we love to work with and that is the best for students. Also, we can have more new relationships with professors, which is the good side. And on the bad side we cannot continue learning with the teacher we love to study with, and maybe the way the different teachers teach is not interesting to us and makes the classes become boring. That is the worst thing on the bad side of having different teachers. After all, I think the good things or the bad things of having different teachers depend on us, depend on the way we face it, and depend on our attitude. If we can face it well, the good things are more abundant than the bad things. If it is good or not is dependent on the way we face it. That's it.

As far as I am concerned, health is the most significant and exceptional thing in the world. You cannot be capable of doing anything unless you are healthy. In this brief essay, I will attempt to explain my reasons. First of all, I would like to set about with wealth, in other words, money. Indeed, you can manage to do loads of things such as buy expensive cars or have a spectacular phone. Even if you can afford to buy important things, you cannot buy affection or health. Have you ever considered what will happen to your tremendous fortune after you die? Your marvelous fortune won't be important anymore. Perhaps, you will marry someone who lacks love, enthusiasm, and empathy. I mean, a person who won't appreciate you. Accordingly, you won't be happy unless you find someone who loves you. Therefore, I would like to conclude by saying that your money will not be valuable if you don't have a soul mate and health. You will be always looked down on by people who have health. My recommendation is for you to be aware of your treasure.

In my opinion, this is a paradoxical statement. In general, I think that health is surely the most important thing in people's lives because without it we wouldn't be able to do anything. On the other hand, in countries like the USA, healthcare is not free, and poor people could be excluded from health treatment. It is also true that middle-class people can live healthily without huge wealth, but it's also true that there are rare illnesses that require specific operations and treatment, and they could be too expensive for them. Otherwise, I think that everyone should have access to every medical treatment, but it is actually a utopian idea due to the economic problems that are affecting the world. For this reason, I think that the two things are truly connected a lot more than people expect, because without health, wealth couldn't exist, but without wealth, nowadays, health is not guaranteed for everyone.

Is it important to always tell the truth? I would say 'yes' but not for every situation. There might be a lot of time we spend on seeking somewhere we prefer to live and there is little in doubt about the people around you. Living in an environment where people tend to tell the truth is a guarantee of being always clear on social systems and the transparency of any relationships. It's definitely a view of life we all have been trying to build. In addition, I know we have been taught to tell the truth since very early childhood. That was a basic installment for the awareness of any situations later. So, we are likely to feel apologetic if we have to lie to someone. On the other hand, it is also important not to tell the truth. We are required to lie to someone if this is good for them or simply for protecting ourselves in some certain circumstances. I remember it is called a 'white lie' which is forgiven easily as you find it the most possible selection to choose. If you are not able to tell the truth and this does not take its toll on anything or anybody, it is fine to do it then but you should accept one significant thing, which is that you may be less believable for others later in life. Taking all factors mentioned into account, telling the truth holds an important role in our lives. But it is completely acceptable to tell a lie depending on the circumstances and we need to ensure that we have a positive reason to do it.

I believe that having different teachers can bring benefits to students. First, each teacher transfers knowledge to a student through a unique methodology. Therefore, if the student has only one teacher for several years, that student will not learn different things in different ways. Second, different teachers are able to share many points of views or perspectives about a topic. This can help the students develop critical thinking and develop their thoughts. If a student has only one teacher for several years, that student will, sooner or later, imitate his teacher's thoughts. Third, if a student has had many teachers for several years, this can help the student shape his character. Therefore, the student can observe, analyze, and then decide what is right and what is wrong. Fourth, each teacher deals with different situations in different ways. In addition, if a student has many teachers, they won't become bored. In short, having many teachers has more pros than cons.

I have heard that you, as town council, is thinking about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think this idea needs to be analyzed carefully. Firstly, due to the increasing use of mobile phones in public spaces, some American research stated that people are losing the ability to have a real conversation. As evidence, nowadays it's common to go to a restaurant and see people around the table, all of them just using their cell phones without talking to each other. In other words, people are becoming increasingly addicted to mobile phones so they are not paying attention to the real world. Therefore, banning use of cell phones in these places would force them to strike up a conversation with someone and be more aware of their surroundings. Despite this, the use of mobile phones has allowed people to contact someone quicker. For this reason, cell phones can be very helpful to get people in touch especially in emergencies. These emergencies embrace all the types, such as work and health emergencies. In sum, banning completely the use of mobile phones in public spaces, like restaurants, shops and public transport, is not the right choice to make. In my opinion, the use should be permitted only in emergencies, because it's impossible to ignore some benefits of cell phones in modern life.

Computers play an important role in our life. Nowadays people can not live without a computer, computers control almost everything. Computers help us to work and communicate with everyone we want.

I also use a computer for relaxing by playing video games with my friends and listening to music. The thing I most enjoy doing with a computer is studying and relaxing.

I do not believe that computers can completely replace books in schools and universities, at least for a while. Books have great importance for students', teachers', and professors' lives. First of all, we use books in PDF format a lot in education, for example. Papers books are maybe in their last days, they can be unusual in the future. But many educators like to use paper books. However, I can predict it will be difficult to use them in the future, it will not be practical to edit a book in this way. Nature and the trees will thank us. I guess that in the future virtual books will be used more and more. They will be more interesting technologically, with animation and with dynamic graphics, for instance. A student will be able to do exercises in a virtual book and have the answer directly. The book will be reborn stronger.

Firstly, American research stated that telling the truth all the time time has several benefits for human health. For instance, it can be less stressful for your life, because you do not need to overthink or to be worried all the time about the possibility of being caught. Moreover, it improves your memory, considering that telling a lie demands some cognitive effort and this can be harmful to your mind over time. To put it more simply, always telling the truth can provide a better quality of life. However, in some cases, the truth can be painful and unpleasant to your listeners. To give an illustration of that, sometimes a person is in a bad mood and expects some compliments to encourage her, but you decide to tell the truth by saying demotivating words. In this situation, the truth hurts the other person's feelings and certainly did not improve her life quality or reduce her stress. Therefore, telling the truth is not always the better choice, unless it's related to violating a law. In this case, the truth is better, because you are going to get caught either way. On the other hand, when it involves people feelings, it's important to analyze each situation carefully, owing to the influence that the words can have on other people's minds in a good or in a bad way.

Regarding whether learning to speak a foreign language is as important nowadays as it was in the past, the answers differ among different groups of people. More specifically, the answer to this question depends mostly on people's education level and occupation type. On average, the more educated people are, the more likely they are to learn a foreign language. While most blue collars or people who only work locally may not need to learn to speak foreign languages, most white collars or people who work in an international atmosphere must master at least one foreign language, especially English. Due to the dramatic development of globalization and international trading, mastering one or more foreign languages is seen as an essential skill that employers will expect from their employees. Besides work, there is also an increasing need to speak foreign languages on vacation if you travel to other countries. There is a greater general requirement for speaking foreign languages, e. g. English these days than in the past.

Personally, I have several reasons for learning English. First of all, over the past few years, the English language has become the most important language in the world and it is nowadays an international language that is spoken by everyone. For this reason, learning English is not only a pleasure but also a duty to be part of a globalized world as it is in our present. On the other hand, I really like the phonetics as well as the culture that is related to it. In fact, I think that the traditions and the story of this language are very fascinating. For me, learning English is also a great opportunity to have a speedy contact with computers, where English is the universal language. In the end, I think that English should be taught with a high level of quality in every country, to give the opportunity to everyone to communicate without any barriers.

Nowadays, children really like playing video games, and video games are very popular with children. To be honest, video games play an important role for children. So we have to be smart in the way we teach our children the healthy way to play video games. Everything has two sides, a good and a bad one, and this topic also has a good and a bad one. One good one is that video games are good for our children to relax after a long day. Nowadays, video games can also teach each of us many stories and profound lessons. The stories and profound lessons that video games bring can help educate our children very well. Those stories and lesson can give us more hope and motivation in life. So in this opinion, we can see video games have a lot of positive effects if we can teach our children the healthy way to play video games. One of the bad ones is that video games may adversely affect our children. If we don't teach our children the healthy way to play video games, our children maybe play video games in an unhealthy way and it is very bad for our children. They can spend all day long just playing video games and it is a real waste of time and really bad for their health. So whether playing video games is good for children or not depends on how we play video games. If we teach our children the healthy way to play video games then it is good. If we cannot teach our children the healthy way to play video games then it is really bad. Whether playing video games is good or not depends on us.

In my opinion, learning a foreign language nowadays is easier than before. In fact, only since the 20th century has learning a foreign language become an important point in people's education. Otherwise, today the level of teaching is much higher than before because learning a foreign language, especially English, is too important to be ignored. In fact, English is taught from primary school onwards and there are a lot of courses to improve the knowledge of the language. On the other hand, I think there still is a low level of knowledge of foreign languages because there are many people who don't understand any language different from their own. That is, in the 21st century, a bad thing because in our world which is more globalized than before, people who will understand only their own language will be cut off from society.

I think both options are very good. I like it when I can experience different types of learning. When you have only one teacher he knows you very well. When he likes you he will probably give you good grades. The problem is when he doesn't like you, he will give you bad marks. I like it when my teacher switches throughout the school years. You get to know different views about one topic. Moreover, every time you have a new chance to get good marks, because it is every time a new start. The teacher gets to know you. I think the best length for one teacher is for about three years. In this time you can get to know your teacher and the other way round. Moreover, you know how the class tests are structured and you can prepare well. In the Abitur you get a test which isn't from your teacher, therefore it is good when the teacher changes through the years.

Regarding whether computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities, the answers differ among people. Some agree with this view, and they argue that learning with computers and tablets is more efficient and eco-friendly. The increase of learning with laptops will reduce paper usage and, therefore, the damage to forests. Furthermore, it is more convenient to carry laptops than carry heavy books around. Finally, it is also more practical to store important files on the cloud, and they can be reached without location restrictions. In contrast, others oppose this opinion, and they state that they are more used to learning with books and doing exercises with pens. As shown in several studies, students who learn with laptops and tablets have a worse performance on average than students who don't. It is difficult for many students to focus on learning without being distracted by other entertainment [uncountable] online. Additionally, computers and tablets are so expensive for many students that they cannot afford them. Finally, it is quite common to lose critical digital files if they were not saved. However, the crucial word of this argument is whether computers and tablets should 'completely' replace books in schools and universities. Since both learning methods have their conveniences and drawbacks, it is not reasonable to replace one with the other completely. Because the financial situation and preference differ among people, everyone should make his own choice concerning this question.

There are many aspects to consider when deciding which conditions would be more effective and reliable for employees who are working in offices. Among these are: the privacy and comfort, the specific activity or job that is being performed and the level of isolation the job requires. Firstly, it is undeniable that employees, as well as everyone else, need their own space with a comfortable and private atmosphere so they can feel less pressured. As a result, I think that an exceedingly open design might pose a challenge for most of them. On the other hand, the specific activity or job they are doing is also a relevant point to consider. Whether they work on their own, individually, they are co-workers or they do these activities in groups, it must be kept in mind since it would undoubtedly affect the matter. Last but not least, the level of isolation that the job demands or that is required should be mentioned too since some jobs need a more peaceful and focused atmosphere, in this case, office, such as a writer, an accountant, a boss, etc., while others might need merely a place to sit or a computer, such as a secretary. In conclusion, to sum up, I differ from the idea of working in small, overwhelming spaces, although I do not go along with the open design ideas either. I think that each job demands different conditions and the already mentioned points are the ones to take into consideration to decide that.

Zoos are wonderful places for everybody to go to explore and to have a lot of good experiences with their family. I think zoos are also a good place for people to learn about animals and learn about how the animals live in nature. I think everything has two sides, a good one and a bad one. On the good side, if we keep animals in zoos, children can see and learn about animals easily without any danger. Zoos can be places for everyone that wants to learn about animals, they can do it easily without any danger. Zoos can also be a place for children who love animals where they are able to see and touch them safely. Parents can take their children to the zoo with them to have another fun experience or to have more memorable memories with their children. In this opinion, we can see a zoo is a wonderful place for everybody, it is a place for everyone to come and have a lot of fun experiences and have more memorable memories with the family.

I think studying abroad or studying in another country for a time during high school or university is an amazing and wonderful experience for students. Most people think it is a great advantage for students to approach their dream and their future, and most people think studying abroad or studying in another country is the best way for students to reach knowledge of the major that they are studying. And for me, it is also the best way to approach my dream. But everything has two sides, a good one and a bad one. On the good side we can see studying in another country is the best way to approach our dream, it is also the best way to reach knowledge of the major that we are studying. Studying in another country, we can learn the language of that country and we can also learn the culture of that country too. Studying in another country we can broaden our horizons and understanding, we can also make more friends and can expand our relationship with people. In this opinion, we can see a lot of advantages that we can have if we study in another country. On the bad side, studying in another country is a hard thing that not everyone can force to study abroad because of the money it costs. And studying abroad can be risky, it is maybe wasting your time and your money. These are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad. Whether it is good or not depends on how we do it.

In 2017 a survey by the University of Oxford showed that 99% of the people questioned answered that they have lied before and that they felt ashamed about it. This research not only shows that lying is common, but also that doing so is connected to feeling guilty about it. In the following I will state my opinion on why not telling the truth is acceptable. To begin, as the survey mentioned above has shown, everybody lies, and it is normal amongst us human beings. Not telling the truth is common and should not be demonized. Furthermore, throughout the human history, lies have defined the development of our society and to give an example, when the Polish King Vladimir did not tell the truth about having started a fight with Queen Elizabeth, he caused the separation of his country from England. In my opinion, it is also vital to take the circumstances under which lies are told into consideration. Since often the truth is not told for protecting either oneself or others, these people can't be blamed for trying to minimize harm. By telling the Nazis a lie about hiding Anne Frank and her family, Miep Goes saved all of their lives. This example shows that it is acceptable to withhold the truth for reasons of protection. Lastly, having lied to help another person should be considered the best reason to legitimate lying. Although helping is a very important and honored trait in today's society, lying to do so is often considered negative. In my opinion these two things are intertwined. Lying for a friend who hasn't done their homework, is a great example to show that lying is okay. In conclusion, these arguments above support my opinion, which is that not telling the truth is acceptable.

In my opinion, everything should be digitalized in the future. In fact, carrying only a computer or a tablet with every book and every note is much easier than carrying heavy books every day. Digitalized books also make you learn faster because you can easily switch from a book to a notepad or underline or delete when you want. On the other hand, having a computer or a tablet could be useful to be connected to the internet. For example, with digitalized books you are able to search for a word whose meaning you didn't understand and you will be able to do research to increase your knowledge in an easy way.

It is the start of a new school year at my school. And my English teacher has asked me to write a report about what I want to achieve in this new school year. So this is my report. At the start of a new school year at my school, I have a lot of things to be achieved. There are so many things that I want to achieve in this new school year that I don't know where to start. The first thing I want to mention is the area of my learning I am pleased with, which is the good facilities that the school gives me. The library is also very good and very modern. That is my pleasure in the areas of my learning. Next are the areas of my learning I want to improve. In these areas I want to improve a lot of things. The thing that I want to improve most is my studying. I want to be the best student in the major that I am studying in my school, but it is also the hardest thing that I have to make it come true. I am going to try my best to make it come true. To achieve those things I am going to hard work every single day.

Hi Matt, It is great to hear from you. We´ll see each other next week, that's great news. You are right, I need to enhance my language skills. This year, I am determined to reach a new English level. For that reason, this summer I have developed a plan. If I wish to reach my goals, I´ll follow it. I´m going to focus my studies in three different areas: talking, reading and writing. Firstly, I talk every day with Jenny, she´s my English teacher. Secondly, I write an essay every Saturday, therefore I am reaching really acceptable writing levels. And thirdly, I watch movies in English without subtitles. I am excited about starting school and seeing you again. All the best

Recently a lot of schools have been adopting new solutions in order to create possibilities for students to learn practical skills. Some of them allow pupils to do some voluntary work in class time. Is this a reasonable solution? It has became a subject which is discussed by newspapers and in TV programs. I will try to present reasons for and against in the essay below. The main reason that supports students' volunteer work is that they can actually help in places where this kind of help is needed. I mean, places like hospitals, shelters and hospices. There is always something more that could be done there. Each extra helping hand counts. The next reason is that student can gain extra experience by helping other people. I honestly believe that one can not learn such skills in school. In my opinion these skills may be very useful after graduation. Also, having volunteer work in your CV may be a deciding factor for getting a job. Employers usually prefer candidates who have such experience. What about reasons against? I find very few indeed. But, you can always say that students should not be forced to do volunteer work if they don't want to. I guess this is supposed to be a free decision for each person. Somebody who is forced is never a good worker. To summarize, in my opinion schools should allow students to help in hospitals, shelters etc. But, it always has to be a free decision for each pupil and his parents.

What do you think about learning another language? I remember the date when I felt a special interest in learning English and why it became one of my goals. I’ve always had a special interest in learning English, but it was once when I was on a school trip, some English people asked me for help and I wasn’t able to help them. So because of my lack of knowledge of English I couldn’t make friends. In addition to that, I want to get a better job and English skills give you advantages to get one. One thing to consider is the fact that the English language is one of the most spoken languages in the world and if I could develop my English skills, I’d be able to travel, meet new people, and also get work abroad. It has become one of my most important aims. To sum up, my strong interest in being able to travel abroad to see the world, make lots of friends, and get better employment opportunities, have taken me on this English learning trip.

Learning to speak a foreign language is not really important these days. If you speak an Arabic language and you go to France, you don't need to learn the language to understand, you can translate what they're saying with your mobile phone. Everything is improving these days, even if you want to learn a foreign language it is way easier to learn than in the past. In the past, learning a foreign language was important because there were no mobile phones that translated quickly, so you needed to learn the language to understand. Even now some foreign languages can be useful for you. If you want to live in France you must learn the language or you won't be able to speak to people. Speaking to people is very useful, it helps you improve your mental health and helps you make new friends.

I have had a lot of holidays with my family since I was a kid, but the holiday that I think was the best holiday ever with my family was maybe 9 years ago and now I can't remember the details of that holiday. So I think I am going to tell you about a holiday where I and my whole family went to an island. It was such a beautiful island, the beach and the scenery were really fantastic. Everyone in my family had a lot of memorable memories that they can't forget. My family and I spent seven days on the island enjoying and sharing moments together. The food was also very good. Everything seemed like really fun and also can forgettable. I don't have anything more to say, not because there is nothing more to say, but because I don't know how to tell you. The feeling on that holiday with my family was so fantastic that I don't know how to express the feeling to you. It is very hard to express feeling for others to understand, and I am bad at this. But I hope you can understand that feeling.

I have had a class discussion on the importance of exercise. Now my teacher has asked me to write a composition answering the question whether it is good or not for our health to do exercise every day. In my opinion, doing exercise every day is very good for our health. But everything has two sides, the good one and the bad one. On the good side, doing exercise every single day is very good for our health. Doing exercise can give us good health and mental alertness that can help us concentrate more in our life. It can also give us a better life if we can do exercise every single day. Doing exercise every day can make us better at our job and our things. In this opinion, we can see the benefits of daily exercise are numerous. On the bad side, if you do exercise in an unscientific way, it will be bad for your health and maybe it will endanger your life. So before we begin doing daily exercise we should research the suitable way for us to do exercise effectively without any danger.

In my view, it is most effective to work in an open space that has no walls to separate workers from their colleagues. Some people say that they can concentrate on their job by working alone. But, I think that it is not efficient for both themselves and their co-workers. I have two points about this. First of all, talking to each other while working is important more than working quietly. I do not mean that they can talk about anything like their hobbies outside their job. I want to say that people working in open space are able to help one another. Then, helping each other with working leads to not only efficiency but also making relationships between them. So, it is the best way to work in an open space. Secondly, workers can be eager to work by seeing their colleagues working. If they work in separate rooms, they can focus on their job but cannot see the work of other workers. On the other hand, in an open space, there are people working arduously wherever and whatever they see around them. So, individuals in an office will want to work with their co-workers and it generates a multiplier effect. Lastly, all in all, I described two points about my idea that it is better to work in an open design office than in separate offices. Recently, we can see many changes in how to work. Then, there is diversity to work in the present society. So, we will have to adapt to a working style in the future.

I attend a dance school. I have to study music at this school. We study theory of music, history of music and also to play the piano. I do not mind , but a lot of people do not like study these things. I think it is not necessary to study music hard in some other schools, because people do not need this knowledge for life. On the other hand, students have to study physics or chemistry and it is also not important for life. Why should people study physics or chemistry , not music? Many people cannot understand music, they cannot feel the rhythm, they cannot learn to play a musical instrument or they cannot sing. That is because they are not talented enough and these people usually do not like the music classes at school. But I still think that every student should have some elementary knowledge of music. It is not necessary to study to play the musical instrument but they should study a little bit of music theory or at least the history of this beautiful art.

I've already visited some zoos, one in Brazil and another in Germany, but I've concluded that zoos are not good places for animals. Because they are not in their habitat and holding them in a fenced place is stressful. Once ago I watched a movie called Blackfish on Netflix, which talked about an orca named Tillikum. It was captured from the ocean where it was living taking care of its group and human beings took it from there to confine it in one of the most famous aquariums in the world called Sea World. There it was taught to jump out of the water and to do funny tricks to entertain viewers, however, in the background it was cloistered and stressed out. But humans did not take that into account, and one day during a show the orca freaked out and killed a presenter in front of the public. That said, I believe that humans must live with animals in harmony at the highest level possible.

Changing a teacher every year is not good for students because when students are comfortable talking with their teacher it's good for students and teachers who want to help and advice students. So if we change the teacher every year, students have to start a relationship with a new teacher and it takes time for them. In contrast, if students have the same teacher for several years, when they have problems, they will feel comfortable talking with a teacher. I once read an article titled "The Impact of Teacher - Student Interaction on Student Motivation and Achievement," it said the interaction between a teacher and student is an important thing.,. when a good relationship has been constructed, a teacher and student enjoy each other and the class, and feel more inspired to do well. In conclusion, a good relationship can improve social skills for a teacher and also for students.

I see a request for articles in a magazine: "We invite you to write about: The Future of Travel." I think I will write my article about this. The Future of Travel is an excellent question. Actually, I don't travel very much, at least I haven't until now. I think I have only been on about eleven trips since I was born. So I think I don't have much experience regarding the future of travel, but I am going to try my best to imagine the way that we travel in the future. Nowadays, people usually travel all over the world by plane, train, and by boat, and that is the only way that people can travel to anywhere they want nowadays. I think in the future, we will still be travelling by plane, but on a modern plane that can go faster and is safer than now. I also think in the future, we can travel by train but on a modern train that can go really fast. Travelling by train and by plane in the future will be really different from today, travelling in the future can be faster. In the future we can travel around the world in just a few minutes.

Dear Katie, How are things? I went to an amazing concert last week. I decided to go to the concert because it was organised in my neighbourhood, close to the park. The price was also quite low, so I was able to afford tickets. I didn't know the performing band before. They are called "Red Guitars." My mom said they were famous when she was young. Even though I usually listen to another type of music, it was enjoyable. There was a little surprise for the audience - everyone got drinks and snacks.

There are over a hundred languages in the world and some of them have already forgotten. So the language may differ from country to country. When you go somewhere and if you do not know the language you will not be able to contact with people. Sometimes you will not be able to contact with your business partners, etc. But there are dragomen out there nowadays. You can hire them too, or you can just use a translator on your phone. But knowing a language still creates opportunities. Firstly, if you know a language other than your main language you may learn about the culture linked to that language. You can visit the countries which use that language and you can mingle with the people. You may feel free and successful. Secondly, if you want to study or work abroad you must learn the language which is used in the country where you want to live. Other than that, if your business partners are foreign you must communicate with them somehow. If you know their language it will please them. They will feel respected. In conclusion, knowing extra languages does not do any harm. Moreover, when you learn a new language, a new world is opened to you. You also learn about a new culture and a different perspective. Knowing a foreign language in today's global world is important.

The expansion of metropolitan cities has influenced several professional figures. Concerning medical doctors, who are the main topic of this brief essay, these are involved in this evolving phenomenon. In fact, most of them are moving into big cities, where the number of patients and, more in general, people is larger than in the country. Of course, money is another important reason. As a result, the number of medical doctors has been strongly decreased in the rural areas, becoming an important issue which has to be fixed as soon as possible. Therefore, what would the solution be? We will try to answer this hard question. First of all, some procedures for the employment of new doctors should be modified. For instance, ten thousand young doctors are waiting for a job in Italy and, at the same time, some regions have not enough doctors. Hospitals must be renewed in order to be more efficient and safer than in the past, so that doctors can do their work properly. Because of the pandemic emergency, doctors and any medical figure represents an important resource for fighting this bad enemy, which is everywhere, not only in the big cities. Little towns, rural areas and poor people must not be left alone.

Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Jules Cool and I am writing this letter concerning the discussion about banning phones from public transport, shops and restaurants and wanted to let you know what my opinions are on this matter. I want to start with the aspect I am most concerned about, namely banning phones from public transport. The devices are indeed necessary for the commuters, since they are being used to buy tickets and to inform themselves about delays. As I strongly believe that our transport system is one of the best in our country, I am worried people will stop using it when there are no phones allowed anymore. Furthermore, I disagree with the council wanting to ban cell phones from shops, because they are not only used to compare prices online, but also to pay for the goods. Therefore, phones are helpful devices when people want to go shopping and must not be prohibited in shops. In addition, I can't support these devices being banned from restaurants, because they are being used by people with disabilities. To elaborate on this, guests who suffer from allergies are dependent on being able to look up certain foods and allergens on the internet. Otherwise it could have very bad consequences. Equally, blind customers have to rely on apps and programmes on their cell phone to read the menu and therefore require their devices. In brief, I think banning cellphones from these public areas is not a good idea. I hope you take my elaborations into consideration when deciding upon this matter. Yours faithfully, Jules Cool

I used Write and Improve for my preparation for the STANAG exams. It was really useful for me, but it is not as good as practising with a real teacher. The problem is that the feedback is not specific enough. It helped me to improve in spelling, but I still have a problem with the composition of sentences. However, it is for free and I can practise whenever I want and that is great. I think that I should recommend it to my colleagues at work, because they need to practise, too and they also do not have a real teacher like me. It is still a lot more useful than just some applications you can download to your phone. The point is that it if nothing else it can help you to be able to learn proper words.

My favourite season of the year When it comes to a favourite season, most people will say it's spring or summer. But for me, winter is my favourite season. Winter weather is cool and pleasant. During that time, in my country, the temperature is in a completely acceptable range and the water is a pleasant 27 degrees Celsius (not freezing, like in some other countries). Evenings may be dedicated to wandering and gastronomic experiences in numerous cozy restaurants. Winter is special for me because during winter there are 2 holidays: one is Christmas and the other is New Year. Those are the 2 holidays I like most. They are the times when everyone can go out and have fun. It makes the city where I live crowded and bustling. In conclusion, winter is my favourite season for 2 reasons.

Nowadays, studying abroad is the best option and it is popular. However, it's hard for some students who have little or no budget because they compete for scholarships to study abroad. So we can see that there is a disparity between a high-class family and a low-class family. There are many advantages of studying abroad, such as improving your language skills and discovering career opportunities abroad. These advantages are attractive for students who are from low-class families from other countries. It's because of the economic differences between countries. In developing countries, there are a lot of students who want to study abroad for their future because most of them are from low-class families. In contrast, the students from high-class families can study abroad with their parents' budget and they don't need to compete for scholarships. There are also disadvantages, such as high costs, language and culture barriers, and high risks. These disadvantages are affecting all foreign students. In conclusion, studying aboard is highly competitive for students who are from low-class families, but it's good for students who have a budget. However, studying abroad is still a golden opportunity for everyone.

Video games are the same as movies, but the difference between video games and movies is the experience. I think video games give you more experience because you feel like it's you in the game. I totally agree with the children who play video games, but the children need to be taught by their parents. The parents shouldn't ban video games because it can cause a bad relationship between them and their children. The best way is trying to understand the children and if it's possible, the parents should play a video game with the children. It can make their relationship stronger and better because the children will feel comfortable and happy with their parents who are interested in the same thing. When you play a video game with them you can teach them about the behavior in video games and in real-life. In conclusion, parents should allow their children to play video games and teach them about the difference between video games and real-life.

From my point of view, I think that both could be a good way to learn English. On one hand, if you have only one teacher for many years you can create bonds with him and he can see your weak points and focus on them. However, if you are always with the same teacher and he always teaches you the same way you can get bored or maybe his teaching method is not the most suitable for you. On the other hand, if you have more than one teacher you can learn different learning methods because each teacher has different teaching methods and personal characteristics. Besides, it can be more interesting for you because every year you'll know new people. To sum up, both have good things, but if I had to pick one I would pick to have more than one teacher, because I think that it might be more fun and probably better for my learning.

Healthy living is the most popular topic every year, people believe that it can help you live a longer life. If you read articles or health magazines, it's all about exercise, healthy eating, sleeping, and nutritious food. So we can't say that exercise is not the most important thing. Some people may have time for exercise, but not everyone can do that, especially, the working-age population. Working people are always busy and exhausted because of their work, so it's difficult to organize their time for working and also for exercise. On the other hand, there are also alternative options for being healthy, such as healthy eating and getting enough sleep. It's simpler than exercise and everyone can do it. Although healthy eating is easier than exercise in some countries, healthy foods are more expensive than fast food. To solve this problem, people can choose nutritious foods that they can find in articles. A healthy lifestyle is not only about exercise, so we can choose alternative options, such as healthy eating, getting enough sleep and choosing nutritious foods. It's not easy to be healthy, but it's important for your body.

There is a question about television being for entertainment and people wondering if television is suitable for education. That is an amazing question for us. And to answer the question we have to think carefully. In my opinion, I think television is a good way to entertain but also an amazing way to educate our children and us. We can see that television played an important part in our childhood, it made our childhood happier and more interesting and it also taught us a lot of useful things. I think television is the best way to educate our children and teach us a lot of things that we don't know. It can also have a lot of information for us to know about the world. But to make it possible for television to educate our children and us effectively is a very hard thing and it takes time to do it.

I prefer to sleep in a dark room, with as little noise as possible. Sometimes I like to watch television before sleeping in the room too. For me, it is important to lie down when I am so tired, and want to sleep, I never go to bed without wanting to sleep. I don't sleep for a long time, so I need to spend the time I sleep very well. I wake up very early every day, and I love to sleep for a short time after lunch.

In the beginning, it was a habit you get used to doing. I used to sleep in a dark room, to feel more comfortable and more relaxed. Quiet is something you can't always control because in many countries we have noisy neighbors who are still awake after midnight, and you can't handle them. Doctors always said that to get all the benefits of sleeping you need to sleep in a dark and quiet room. So, always try to make your sleep as good as you can to have a great day.

Television used to be the most popular audio-visual medium. Many TV programs can entertain and also educate such as documentaries. But nowadays this is an era of technology, so there are many audio-visual devices, these devices are more convenient and fascinating than television. However, television is still the most popular platform for news, but in the new generation, people access social media by using their smartphones. On the other hand, television is the best equipment for a family. Watching television as a family can build strong family relationships through making conversation and having fun together. Parents may worry that kids can become addicted to their cell phones and it's a golden opportunity. I once read an article titled "Watching TV can be good for kids." It said TV shows can inspire kids to try new activities and engage in "unplugged" learning. In conclusion, television is still very useful for kids and it's the best equipment for accessing the news.

Thanks to the extension of communication networks and the promotion of the Internet over the last two decades, a new way of being able to learn has appeared. Online learning is a system that is much more flexible and adapts to different ways of living. Thanks to being able to study online, it has greatly increased the different resources and materials available, as well as adapting to people's different schedules and lives. Now it is easier to find information about what you want to learn and you have less rigid schedules, being able to adapt. On the other hand, the individual's demands must be higher. Now, it is up to each person to find the motivation and to follow up, trying to find areas without distraction and to take advantage of the moments available. So, I recently discovered a new website to improve your writing, which is called write&improve, where I can write and rewrite my own composition at some levels (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) forcing me to improve my grammar and write about some subjects and topics. However, this way of learning sometimes is not easy to follow up and continue working because you have to do homework by yourself, but if you plan well and motivate yourself, you can improve day by day. The Write & improve method is helping to adapt and incorporate new grammar in my English level.

In my opinion, there is no doubt that being healthy is a lot more important than being rich. However, it is important to realise what being healthy actually is. The fact is that to be healthy you have to take care not just of your body, but your mind, too. The body is quite easy. You have to eat the right food and work out every single day and you will be fine. But what about your mind? For example, me. I do not need money to be happy, but I need to be working hard and do my job as well as I can, otherwise I feel useless. So, I would rather sleep less and have more stress to be good in my job than take a day off. I could have a day off, but I would feel like worthless afterward. And if your mind is not set properly, the body will follow.

I would like to recommend to all of the readers a website called "Write and Improve." I've been using this resource since September and definitely can say it's helping me a lot! Thanks to W&I, I improved my vocabulary and sense of grammar a lot. Writing is easy and enjoyable for everyone, so the idea of doing it in another language and then seeing feedback and my progress is incredibly smart! I like how you can observe changes you make over the months and even be told what language level you're currently at. I also enjoy the feedback I get every time - when I combine it with Grammarly, I start to see mistakes more clearly and - more importantly - understand what and why I did wrong! The only difficulties I had to face were with an online connection. It'd amazing if I could use this tool everywhere, no matter of a stable Internet connection. One of the last negative things I can think about is that you have to know basic English - both grammar and vocabulary. Of course, the section "for beginners" is helpful, but it's all about writing without any clues except a topic. All and all, as I said earlier, I really recommend this site. I have seen changes in my grammar after a few days of everyday usage. My friends seem satisfied too. I hope you will try it out!

The way of sleeping is different for each person. Light and noise are elements that work to help or interfere in this moment. I don't have a problem going to bed. Usually, I sleep in other situations with light and noise, but I prefer to sleep in a dark room and where there isn't noise or any music. I only need a place to put my head and I can sleep very quickly. A long time ago, I was working in the countryside and I had to take bus every day from the bus station. When I set off, I immediately took a nap. So, sleep, for me, doesn't need special conditions to happen, I can take a nap very easily and quickly.

Choosing where to live as a university student is an important decision to make. In my opinion, when university students have their own places, they can have many benefits compared to living with families. First, by living away from their families, those students learn to be independent and not rely on others' help. It pushes them to be serious and responsible since they now need to perform many things that they previously have not even thought about. For example, they need to find and evaluate a living space which is suitable for their situations. In addition, they need to do everyday tasks, such as buying groceries, regularly cleaning the place, etc. Second, living on their own, students can have freedom and full control of their time. They could utilize their time for activities that enable them to achieve their goals. For instance, they might need to spend more time at night to study for a hard subject or find a work opportunity to complement their studies. This is possible because they are free from their family responsibilities and schedules. In conclusion, when students live on their own, they learn to take care of their lives' matters and focus their time and effort on things that interest them and provide a chance for rapid growth. When students at universities live independently, they put themselves on the road to success early on.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. This is a statement that my teacher asked me to write an essay about. In my opinion, I think health is the most important thing in life. And, of course, health is more important than wealth because if you don't have good health, you can't do anything well. We can earn money in different ways and we can earn money whenever we want, but we can't earn health and, when we lose health, we can't do anything we want or need. So that is why to be healthy is more important than to be rich. But you can see that there are a lot of people who are trying to earn money but they don't take care of their health and that is really bad. That is a serious problem nowadays, they just care about making money, but they don't take care of their health, and it is awful for them. When they get old, they are not fully healthy, then they have to spend the money that they tried to make when they were young to take care of their health in hospital. It is really awful.

I love Chinese food. I am not sure if you know about it. Maybe in your country you don´t have this type of food. I do not enjoy going to restaurants, so I have decided to cook my own food. I did a Chinese food course ten years ago. I now eat this kind of food almost every day. I relish Chinese food because it is tasty, healthy and colourful. This international food has a great variety of recipes, although I revel in vegetables ones. My opinion is that vegetable recipes are the best choice because you have all the energy, nutrients and flavour in one spoonful. In conclusion, you should try it if you can.

Nowadays we hear very often of how young people underestimate the importance of doing sports. Many do not understand or do not want to comprehend the fact that sitting in front of our computers is not the best activity to do all day long. We need to do some sort of physical activity in order to stay healthy. However, because of this, is it crucial to force students to do sport at least 3 times a week? Does everyone have to attend PE classes at their school and should we even have PE classes at school? In my opinion there are some exceptions, which we should take into consideration. Firstly, as I have already pointed out in the first paragraph, sports activities are valid in achieving healthy lifestyle. This is why I think every student, starting from the first grade of primary school and ending in the second grade of secondary school, should have obligatory PE classes at school 3 or 2 times a week. The third graders should have the possibility to do sport at school but I think it should be an extra-curricular activity, since the third grade ends with A levels and young people, who face this exam, must focus on studying. Another issue that I want to write about is that some students may do sports outside the school. In that case, school should take that fact into account because then, those students shouldn't be forced to exercise at school. If they do enough sports activities after lessons then why should they take PE classes at school? They only waste their time by doing that. Overall, I believe that sports activities are very important especially for young people, to avoid, for example, obesity. It is good that schools care about their students in that matter, however they should consider making PE classes not obligatory if a students does sports during their free time.

Dear Friend, How is it going? I'm spending my free time watching movies and TV series. Regarding movies, I watched a movie which made me feel amazed. Its title is "Taxi Driver." Directed by Martin Scorsese, it talks about a man called Travis Buckle, who applies for a job as a taxi driver. We are in the 70s, the war in Vietnam has just concluded and is remembered by Americans as an awful event. The isolation and madness are relevant for the protagonist's behaviour. He feels alone and he searches constantly for a way to avoid it. But this will represent his self-destruction. In my opinion, the best scene of the whole film is the speech in the mirror. Travis is talking to the mirror, while he is preparing his guns to murder the most famous politician of the city. The evolution of his mind is the heart of the story. This is the reason why I love it. I stop here because I don't want to spoil anything! I recommend it to you, and I believe you will appreciate it. Let me know what you think about it. Love, Jerry

Hello Jim, How are you? Some days ago, you sent me an email in which you asked me if I had been to that music concert. Well, this is the reason why I'm writing this email. As you know, I went to a concert of my favourite rock band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, because my brother gave me a ticket for their concert as a gift. What an amazing experience! There were many people, crowded together and attached to each other like sandwiches. But it seemed not to be important with respect to the band. They were fantastic, performing not only the latest album release, but also their greatest hits such as 'Californication', 'Give it away', and so on. The whole audience jumped with Flea the bassist and Anthony the frontman of the rock band. The concert lasted for about three hours and a half. Time passed very fast! It seemed to have lasted just for some minutes. Actually, this was just the only drawback. Anyway, I'm going to see them again. The next time, you have to go with me! See you. Lots of love, Jack

What are the reasons for this problem? The reasons are diverse for this reason, so then we will analyze some situations and factors which force the medical doctors to work in some cities instead of rural areas. - Notoriety to work in a famous hospital: most of the important hospitals are in big cities, for instance Memorial Hospital is in NY City and you can get more resources to participate in some research & development projects. - Experience working on specific specialities: most of the medical doctors want to specialize in specific medical areas like Traumatology, Cardiology, Oncology and Hematology. These specialities cannot be practised in small hospitals or rural areas, so then, physicians would prefer to work at these hospitals which are in big cities. - Better salary: this factor is the consequence of the last 2 factors commented before, if you have experience and notoriety, you will earn more money because you will treat more patients, you will receive some offers from private hospitals and you can combine your practice in public and private health care. Having two salaries is quite common in the health care environment. these 3 key factors, that's why they want to work in big hospitals. I'll just try to answer your second question "How can it be solved?" It will be solved if we can build some big hospitals which connect some rural areas and meet notoriety, experience and salary. This concept is called a Reference Hospital and you can attract some medical doctors to these rural areas and of course ensure a salary which will be competitive agaisnt the medical doctors working in big cities. To sum up, if you want to have good medical doctors in a rural area, you should get notoriety, experience and salary, but also, a work life balance that you can find in most of the rural areas such as fresh air, inner peace, no rush, less stress and living close to the mountains or coast.

Zoos are good places for adults and children to see animals and to build a relationship between humans and animals. Nowadays, people in the western world have no or little contact with animals. Because of the industrialization and urbanisation there is no place or there are bad conditions for animals. People are used to going to the zoo and it is a part of their life. No one asks themselves why animals have to be in a cage. And what about the animals, are they really happy to live in a cage? Animals cannot speak to us and they cannot tell us their feelings. My opinion is animals do not belong in a city. You must not put animals in a town, but rather put humans in the wilderness. The living space of animals is not a town. Animals do not have to adapt to our city life. That is not natural. NA,. we have to show consideration for animals. We must allow ourselves to ask if that thinking and acting fits with our values and imagination.

And then, you can check again to see if the changes you made are good or not. But, nothing is perfect. This tool is not an exception. I have tried using for a week and sometimes, I got a problem with the error checking system. Sometimes, it didn't work well. For example, in a task, I used the word "Complain" and it recognized that one was not correct??? Another thing I think is a drawback of this tool is that some of the tasks are not necessary. For example, it has a task that tells you to write about the experiences you got after helping at a pop concert. I don't think many people have done that thing. In a nutshell, this tool has its pros and cons. The cons may make you confused sometimes but in general, this is a good tool for people who want to improve their Writing Skill.

It goes without saying that living a long and successful life is a craving every individual has. However, when it comes to choosing between having a long but calm life and a shorter but more intense one, no doubt I would stand for the second option. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed as follows. To begin with, I would like to point out some of the reasons why I would undoubtedly choose having a shorter but more exciting life, instead of a long and calm one. If there is something remarkable about our mere existence, it will be nothing but the fact that we all have just one life. This certainty of having just one life makes it be the most valuable treasure one can possess because it is unique and genuine for every single person . We all are well aware of, at some point, our lives will get to an end. Perhaps, because of that statement I consider that, in terms of time, quality prevails over quantity, if we have under consideration that the more experiences you have, the higher sensation of happiness you will feel. At no circumstances should anyone regret any decision made which comes from our hearts. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned with regard to having a shorter existence. By living lesser, not only are you to miss the opportunity of witnessing how your children grow but also you are not going to be able to get to know how the future develops. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that no matter what your choice may be, the most pivotal thing is that you have to be who you want to be during your life however long it may last because that way is how you will find the sense of belonging.

Dear town council, I am writing to you regarding the issue of banning mobile phones on public transport , in shops, and in restaurants. Although mobile phones have a lot of disadvantages, such as social disintegration, an awful effect on health, and trespassing on others privacy by taking pictures of them or recording their voices without getting their permission, we need to consider that phones are essential and cannot be banned for several reasons. To begin with, phones are important to report any accident that may occur in public areas, like a car crash, a fire, a crime, or a severe health condition. In those situations, it is critical to contact the police or special forces to deal with the circumstances at once. Secondly, there are a lot of people that need to take calls at all times, like doctors, salesmen, policemen, parents (in case their children need them), and in general everybody. Prohibiting people from receiving urgent calls can result either in people not going to shops and restaurants, or causing protests to dwell in order to stop this ban. In addition, so many students use phones to listen to their recorded lectures or read a novel on their way to their destination on public transport. Preventing them from seizing their time and using it wisely will affect them badly. Finally, I believe that allowing mobile phones is the right decision for the comfort and safety of people. Sincerely, Batool

"Sitting on a chair, holding a book in my hands. I hear the rustling of leaves in the trees on a breezy night. Everything around me is calm as it used to be and as it is going to be until I die" When imagining this scenario, I pray to god not to let my days weary, and let me live enthusiastic, fierce, savage and delightful days that will render me a thunderstorm of feelings and events, even if I have to pay a portion of my life in order to achieve that. How long we lived is determined by how much we accomplished, and the amount of knowledge we left to the generations that are going to follow us. If you asked me how much Einstein, Disney and Edison lived, I'll tell you that they've never died since their memory is going to live for ever. Such leading eminent figures have really lived their lives through every intense detail in them. Routine kills people, it makes them no better than animals that spend their lives doing the same things over and over again. God granted humans with a brain to think, innovate, discover and change their lives for the better. For those reasons, I much prefer to live a whimsical life full of ups and downs, because thence I can consider myself alive.

As you can see, nowadays, more and more medical doctors want to work in cities, where they will make a lot of money, instead of rural areas. This leads to a phenomenon of lack of doctors in those places. So, what are the reasons for this problem? How can it be solved? This essay will examine the main reasons and suggest some solutions to solve it. One of the main culprits resulting in this common trend is the fact that the salary and benefit packages in urban hospitals are more attractive than rural areas. People might have the tendency to choose a generously-paid job after working several years and medical doctors are no exception. They would prefer to contribute to city hospitals, where the number of patients is enormous, which means they could get a higher salary. Another factor adding to this issue would be related to the disparity in living standards between cities and rural areas. Being a doctor is a heavy profession, hence those working in this field desire a deluxe lifestyle. They think they deserve to have it. So, how to solve this problem? There are some solutions to this issue. One of them is that government should enhance the fringe benefits for doctors who are working in rural hospitals. In detail, bonuses could be rewarded for freshly graduated medical students if they chose to devote themselves to those institutions. In addition, workforce distribution should be taken into consideration. This means not all the doctors graduating from medical schools can work in their favored places. It depends on their skills. In a nutshell, there are 2 reasons that have led to the lack of medical doctors in the countryside: One, the disparity in living standards, salaries and benefits between cities and rural areas. Two, their desire of having a deluxe lifestyle. If the government and individuals share collective responsibilities, it's possible to solve this problem.

It goes without saying that zoos have always been significant places where people get to know about animals, their habitats, and the way they live. In this writing task, I am going to express my thoughts about that matter. To begin with, I am going to mention the positive aspects zoos possess. Had it not been for zoos, we would not have been able to contemplate some animal species from a short distance. I cannot deny that this is definitely one of the main reasons why some people would regard zoos as proper sources of knowledge when it comes to understanding how animals live and behave. It actually is an interesting way to watch them and learn from them. Nevertheless, there are some negative aspects concerning zoos that should be underlined. Lately, there has been an increase in the number of people who claim keeping animals in zoos is not a fair method of analyzing animals because it tempers with their lives, and I am in favor of this thought. In that spirit, it is often argued that in places like zoos not only is freedom taken from animals but they also live in terrible conditions, and that is something we should not consent. Animals are taken away from their natural environment, separated from their family members, and used as entertainment instead of being treated as the living creatures with feelings they truly are. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by adding that there truly is a more respectful way to enjoy animals, combining both watching them face to face and respecting their lives, and this way is no other than going on safari. I know it is an option that not many people can afford, but it definitely is the correct one.

It's true that a working area plays an important role for the workers, especially the ones working in an office. An open office or a closed office, which is better? It's hard to answer. So, let's take a look at them. Firstly, an open office. An open office is an environment where there are no enclosed office rooms or cubicles for employees. Usually, employees work in the same room, beside each other, while sitting along a huge desk or workstations positioned close together. Many workers prefer this design because they can easily communicate with their own teammates or even different teams. They are more likely to establish relationships among each other. But, this design has some disadvantages. First, noise. You can't definitely avoid noise when working in an open area. If you and your teammates are working on a task that requires quiet concentration, this design will make it a lot harder. Secondly, conflicts. When a group of people with different personalities and beliefs are crammed into a prison-like room to work for 8 hours a day, there is a high possibility of misunderstandings and conflicts. Finally, spreading illness. When someone is sick with communicable disease, they can easily transfer and spread the virus to the rest of department. That's about an open office. How about a closed one, a traditional design one? With this design, workers have more safety, privacy and stability. Moreover, many workers tend to concentrate more on their work while sitting in an area surrounded by something. But, just like the open design, this one also has some disadvantages. Firstly, cost. A closed office is more expensive to build and maintain than an open one. Since each employee has his own workplace or cubicle, you will need a bigger area to fit every member of your team in. Secondly, low supervision. Each employee has his own workplace, so it's hard to supervise what he is doing. Is he working or playing games? In a nutshell, each design has its own advantages and disadvantages. It's hard to say which one is better.

Dear Peter, Just let me explain to you that we have 2 meals in Spain. I always have breakfast at 10 AM and after that I have lunch at 14.00 PM. Furthermore, I always have more or less 2 snacks and then, I have dinner at home or try to go out for dinner with my family or some friends. Answering your question, my favourite food is ´Cargols a la llauna´ that is grilled snails which are made in a special pan. This dish is often eaten out in Catalan restaurants and it's better to eat it for lunch. I supposed that it sounds disgusting to eat snails but it's quite common in Catalonia. Have you eaten grilled snails? Best regards, Roger

If you live in a big and vibrant city, you have to agree that it is not so difficult to find many facilities around you but if you live in or visit small towns and village, you probably have lived some situations where is almost impossible to find some essential facilities. It is completely dreadful when you need some facilities and it is so rare, even more if we are talking about health needs. Health assistance can become a great problem when you are far from the big cities, so in some small cities it is impossible to find a doctor and you can even take days or months to make an appointment. One of the reasons for this problem is that the doctors won't work in small cities. They always prefer to work in medium or big cities so they can make more money in these cities. Besides, if they work in small cities, they have to get used to living in a quiet place and most of them cannot settle in small cities. This problem has no easy way to be solved because the government cannot force the doctors to work in small cities so some other alternative needs to be thought of. The government in some countries offer many types of incentives to try to attract doctors to live and work in small cities. The government pay a really good salary, provide a home and car and countless other types of perks for the doctors that are available to work in some far away cities. Despite this great effort, there are still many cities that need doctors with a desire to work there. Perhaps one alternative is the government could give support to the local students so that they achieve their medical graduation with the condition that they cannot leave their cities after graduation.

Eating is a very special time for me. It's like therapy and helps me to feel good. In Brazil there are a lot of kinds of food. The typical food came from Africa, Europe and and native people. I love Italian food, especially the pizza and spaghetti. I try to eat them once a week. I love this food because I like a lot of cheese, this ingredient is common in the cuisine.

From my point of view, I think it is important to be able to speak a foreign language. In the past years, I have noticed people choosing English as a foreign language, because it is the most used in the world and it is the easiest to learn. Firstly, universities in Europe are teaching foreign students from the Asian and African continent in English and French, but if they choose to stay in the country they study in it is required for them to learn the language which is spoken in that country. Secondly, it is good to study a country's history and see what is the most attractive for you, then start and learn its language because you never know when you will have that feeling of changing countries. Although people are born in nice countries, they are rejected by their own leaders and forced to move to foreign countries because of corruption, in spite of leaving their families and their homeland which has a big contribution to their spiritual life. In conclusion, I would like to say that learning a foreign language is important and required.

I like to sleep in complete darkness. Even the smallest amount of light can be disturbing. However, my curtains are not the best, and some light slips in through the gaps. To sort this out I have bought an eye mask. I read a lot about circadian rhythm, and the way it affects our sleep. Since then, I'm not comfortable with light and noise during the night. To deal with noise I bought a pair of ear plugs. Unfortunately, they're not the most comfortable solution. I usually spend a lot of time on my smartphone just before bed time. After I learned about the circadian rhythm, I changed my habits completely.

The School of the Future Have you ever given a thought to the matter concerning how the school of the future will be? It goes without saying that, every time we think of the future, technology has a significant role in it, and, needless to say, technology will play its part in schools in the future as much as in the rest of our daily routines. Distant though it may seem, the future is closer than ever, in the sense that in recent years there has been a sharp increase in the usage of technological devices among the population as well as in schools. I cannot help but mention that when it comes to picturing the school of the future, I tend to imagine a robot taking the teacher's place and computer screens to achieve every task that should be done. Nevertheless, replacing a human teacher with a robot one would be a terrible mistake, in my humble opinion, due to the fact that human contact cannot be replaced by any gadgets. Each and every student has a different personality and distinct needs, and only a real person is capable of adapting the study method to every individual. In contrast, I find that the rest of technological devices that could be introduced in the school system would have a positive impact on the students' learning as their principal aim is to ease our lives and enable us to reduce the time we spend on school tasks. So next time you stop and wonder how the future will be, you should take into consideration that human beings will have to be part of it, and nothing will ever substitute real feelings whatsoever, not even at school.

Thank for recommending Write and Improve to me. I have found this tool to be quite useful. I will start my description with the positive aspects and then move on to the flaws. What I like the most about it is the level of advancement. It seems that the developers have thought about all English learners. There is a variety of writing tasks for each level, which are related to everyday situations. Another interesting feature is the progress graph. It provides a vital check of your improvement. However, feedback is the most confusing part. The sentences with errors are being highlighted and you receive a short, written explanation. On the one hand, it is very detailed, as even the lack of a comma highlights the whole sentence. On the other hand, the written explanation is useless, because you have to figure out for yourself what you have done wrong. I think that Write and Improve could do better. Then it would be superior to all other learning methods.

I believe it depends on the teacher and I will be happy to justify my answer. Learning is like a journey and the teacher is a student's guide. As long as the teacher can take the student where he wants to go, it's fine. There is of course more to it. The aspect of integrity is important. For example, some teachers are only there for money, just doing their jobs. Whilst others are the true teachers, who care about the student and his progress. Some of the teachers are also disorganised and excessive. They seem to be lost in the lecture and often forget about time. It's like walking a long distance without taking a break. It can be exhaustive for students, and can cause them to lose enthusiasm. On the other hand, I meet teachers who are willing to go the extra mile. They have remained a students in a sense, are not afraid of questions, and are keen to investigate issues. These teachers I respect the most.

Nowadays, people tend to present totally different tastes regarding sleeping habits. Some prefer to sleep in a totally dark room with ears plugs, otherwise they couldn't fall asleep or even if they did, they would, for sure, toss and turn all night long. Others who are more fortunate are able to sleep no matter the setting or sound. They have even been shown to drop off holding a smartphone or watching TV. Why is it so, that we differ from each other when it comes to sleeping? First of all, something that considerably influences the way we behave is the place of our origin, as well as patterns we have got accustomed to. So, if we were brought up in chaos and in an extended family where it was always noisy it still doesn't bother us resting with background noise.

In my opinion, if we want to have good quality sleep we should sleep in a dark and quiet room. The light negatively impacts our sleep. It reduces our sleep quality. Noise is the same. They impact our sleep negatively. On the other hand, some people are heavy sleepers. They aren't disturbed by light or noise. I know some people who are heavy sleepers. They can sleep wherever they want. However, some people are light sleepers. They are disturbed by light and a bit of noise, like me. I don't want to sleep with light and noise. They disturb me effectively.

Both have their pros and cons so I think that a company should design its layout appropriately for its purpose. So what I mean is that a marketing department, for instance, should not be so enclosed or strict because of its purpose which is creation and coming up with creative ideas and when you are inside an enclosed place you feel enclosed which will not help them to achieve the department's purpose, whereas an operational department will ask for a more strict layout because of its purpose. Another thing to take into account is how the workplace affects employees' mental health, it can seem an empty discussion but it's more important than we think. The longer you're in there the more affected you are. As I mentioned before, some departments will need to be stricter than others. However, this doesn't mean that the place will be completely closed. Even though some departments ask for a more strict layout, it's totally necessary to allow the sunlight to come in. This is important for people's vitamin D absorption which will prevent a large number of illnesses. So in my opinion, an open place to work is better than an enclosed one but it's important to consider the department's purpose at the same time to leverage the department's potential.

English is one of the most spoken languages in the world. I wonder whether there is someone who cannot speak at least one English word. It is impossible. Because of globalization and the mixture of traditions and culture, in addition to a rising demand for more and more language skills, English has become the basis. Concerning my personal experience, I love using English. I am learning the idiomatic expressions of this amazing language more and more, with its culture and literature. From Byron to Blake, from Shakespeare to Milton, I read their masterpieces, trying to understand their thoughts and feelings. Of course, a language must be spoken: writing, listening, and English grammar are surely important, but it is not enough. This is the reason why I am talking in English more and more, every day. One friend of mine is helping me to do that. Moreover, I am used to watching movies and TV series in this language, so that I can improve my listening and spelling skills. A foreign language is a "strange world," which is waiting to be discovered! I love English!

These days, some high schools consider volunteer work as a requirement for their students in order to graduate. Is that necessary or not? To my way of thinking, I think it's crucial. There are several reasons why I say that. Firstly, it is proved that volunteer work gives pupils essential skills and practical experiences for their future lives. By doing volunteer work, pupils can get social knowledge and skills such as public speaking, fast reflective skills, interpersonal skills, etc. Life has different stages. Pupils should not only just focus on their school life but also on their social life. They should know how the world is going outside school. Having expertise but lacking social knowledge is really bad for their future. Secondly, it also shows that pupils have the ability to contribute to their countries. Almost all volunteer work is related to resolving unemployment, gender inequalities, crimes, etc. In addition, participating in those activities shows that pupils are concerned and have capabilities of giving solutions and making improvements to bad social problems. Finally, social relationships. Participating in those activities helps pupils improve their social relationships and extend them. They can meet other people and make friends with them. That really helps them with their future lives. In a nutshell, volunteer work is crucial for pupils. " Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life. It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop," said Dr. Dorothy Height.

My personal opinion is we would have a way to deal with noise but we might not deal with brightness. The solution to dealing with noise which I came up with immediately is ear plugs. You can shut out the noise only by putting ear plugs in. It is easy! But with brightness, will you cover yourself up with the blanket? Soon, you will feel too warm to hide there. Will you use eye masks? No, I do not think it would be the best way, How do you know it is the morning if you are in the dark unless you take your eye mask away?

In my opinion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, maybe after reading a book or watching television on my cellphone. For me, sleeping in a noisy or light room is an unpleasant experience. I don't like noise, including relaxing music or classical music, neither do I like bright or small lights because the light activates thoughts of my duties. Regards another observation, neither do I believe in using a mask or smells like incense, in this case, incense makes me cough. I also don't think eating a lot before bedtime is a good idea to induce sleep, it gives me nightmares. I noticed when I do exercise, I feel a little relaxed and it makes it much easier to induce good sleep. Finally, if a quiet and dark room are not enough, drinking a glass of milk always help me.

Dear Sir I hereby write this letter to express my concern about the ban on the use of mobile phones at various spots. I strongly disagree with your idea of forbidding phones on public transport. Usually, people use them as a form of entertainment while they travel from one place to another. The use of their mobiles enables them to see the time pass a little bit faster. A further point is that there are a lot of people who, for instance, read the newspaper on the train, because it is the only moment in their tight schedule they have the time to do it. In the circumstances, I would be only too happy if mobile phones could be forbidden in restaurants and shops. I find it distressing, seeing a group of friends sitting around a table and only talking to their phones, instead of each other. Particularly noticeable is that we don't socialise enough anymore. However, even if I strongly believe that there are some advantages of banning mobile phones in shops and restaurants, it would infringe on everyone's privacy. Banning the use of cigarettes in restaurants was considerable, because it was harmful to your surroundings, whereas mobile phones don't cause health issues. I strongly recommend reconsidering the ban on mobile phones. I hope you consider my letter. Yours faithfully

It goes without saying that, telling the truth is commonly believed to be the best option whenever we are asked about anything. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed below. To begin with, I would like to point out the reasons people who are in favour of telling the truth permanently give to support that idea. Needless to say, we contribute to our credibility by giving a neat and honest answer. People find it easier to trust us if we do not hide the information we possess and explain the facts that lead us to certain positions with regard to a topic. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned concerning telling the truth, as in the case of bad news. When it comes to giving information that could be harmful or delicate for a person, we ought to take into account the other person's feelings. For that reason, I consider that every now and then it is understandable to tell a lie instead. Particularly, when we talk about information rated as overwhelming. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that we should evaluate previously if the information we own is worth being given to the other person. If we cause a problem by telling the truth, then it would be preferable to keep that truth to yourself, otherwise, we would regret making a person unhappy.

My favourite season of the year is spring and I would like to explain my reason. First of all, I will describe the way I see other seasons. Summer is great. There are long days and short nights, it is a warm and relaxing time. However, you know that autumn is coming, the worst season of them all. Why the worst? Because I know that the darkness is coming. Here come the long nights and short and cold days. Don't get me wrong, I do not avoid suffering and I am glad that I am able to live outside of my comfort zone, but what is the best time in life? The best time isn't the suffering and it isn't the end of the suffering either. The best time is the last minute before the light comes. And that's why I love spring. It symbolises the end of the misery and a new beginning.

Currently if you want to get a better job it is essential that you’re able to speak another language, such as English or Italian. In the past it wasn’t important, you could be successful without the knowledge of another language. Moreover, today we live in an age in which everyone has contact with different cultures around the world, consequently more people are interested in learning new languages. In conclusion, learning a foreign language is more relevant these days. The necessity of getting a better job and the increased interest in travelling abroad, these and other aspect have made it more important to learn a new language than years ago.

Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently apprehended that the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants may soon be banned in our town. For that reason, I would like to give my opinion on that matter. From my perspective, the use of smartphones is inalienable and a pervasive part of our lives. Due to globalisation and the increasing importance of fast communication our society has adapted to the use of smartphones. Nevertheless, there are cases in which smartphones are not necessarily needed to be used: My impression is that the ban of smartphones in restaurants is legit and moreover a right measure. Moreover, I am convinced that the use of smartphone is a social barrier for two or more people that have met in a restaurant. I could observe on my own how plenty of friends were sitting on one table but talking to no one and gazing at their smartphones. I think that those cultural events shall stay cultural events by barring smartphones so that people are communicating in real life. Above that, the decision of banning smartphones on public transport is a superb one. I have no doubt that this measure should have been taken a long time ago. By way of illustration, approximately ten thousand people are dying every year in Britain due to distraction of smartphones. I would be pleased if my recommendations and opinion were heard. Sincerely, Kamran Ghulam

Some students that got accepted to college maybe will decide to continue their educational journey away from their family. I think it's probably better for the students to live on their own. That will teach them responsibility. In addition, it will help them to be independent and they will develop a strong character. Being responsible is one of the goals that parents try to teach their children. Students that decide to live on their own will learn to rely on themselves as well as take full responsibility for their actions. My sister was a very reckless person so we encouraged her to live on her own when she got accepted to university. All of a sudden, she became a different individual. She started to take control of her life and organized her time as well as her to-do list. For that reason, my parents were massively proud and happy for her. As it has been mentioned before, going to university may be a huge step in an individual's life. It will help in forming their characters and build their personality. I was a shy person that always got nervous when talking to others. Since I was scared of trying different things I decided to break my comfort zone by living away from home. It was a hard decision but when the time passed it got easier. I developed great communication skills as well as learning to be comfortable around others. To sum up everything that has been stated, living on your own while attending school will probably be more beneficial than living with your family from my perspective.

I wish I could live forever, never grow up, always have a good time. I wish my life would never end, but if I had to choose between a long, calm life or a shorter and more intense one, I would definitely pick the shorter one. One reason why I would do such a thing is my love for adrenaline. Ever since I was little, I was a fan of extreme things; I used to love rollercoasters and scary movies and I haven't changed at all. I see life as a video game where you're the hero and if you want to finish it, you have to pass some difficult levels. Another reason why I wouldn't choose the long life is my tendency to get bored with things very quickly. No matter how much I enjoy something, I always feel like I need to switch things up. A calm life could never be enough for me. I want something memorable; I want to experience love, heartbreak, loss, happiness, sadness; I want all the things that make us human. I understand why some people would prefer to live longer: more time with your loved ones, more time figuring things out and a lot of other things that take time. Even though I would want those things too, I can't imagine myself choosing a quiet and peaceful life. All in all, this isn't the first time I've spoken about this topic and after giving it much thought, I realised what my choice is. I want an intense life, even though it might be short.

I used to sleep in a dark and quiet room far from the noise in the street. But everything changed when my son was born. We moved to the first room, which is bigger and more comfortable, that means that we usually listen to the noise from the street. Also, we adopted the habit of sleeping with a small light on because we used to get up many times to care for him when he was a baby. Nowadays, we continue with the habits that we adopted some years ago. Nevertheless, I can sleep in darkness or with light, in a quiet or noisy room, it doesn't matter.

One of the best ways to expand our horizons and our brain connections is by travelling. It is a mix of new places, new food, new people, and a new way to see the world. In the past, trips were too long and people usually spent weeks or months on only one trip, nowadays, we spend hours on a trip. Therefore, I believe that time spent on trips will be shorter in the future. Even though we've invented a large number of means of transportation, some more will be invented or they are being invented. On the other hand, some things will never change, I would say that people interaction will always be essential for a great travel experience because we are humans and we need human contact. In a nutshell, the time spent on a trip will be shorter in the future, however, the necessity of human interaction will always exist.

Nowadays, many schools require students to learn and play a musical instrument. Some people say it's not necessary, students don't need to learn it. The others say the opposite. To my way of thinking, I think music should be taught at school. Why? Music is a subject to help students relax after heavy studying hours. As you can see, students must learn many subjects at the same time. Math, Literature, Physics,... everything. The classes go on continuously. One class is finished, the next one is going to start in a few minutes or even immediately. It means that except in the break time, students don't have much time to relax after finishing a class. Music will help them with that problem. In addition, the curriculum of this subject is not heavy. Students just need to know some basic knowledge such as some chords, notes, etc. They don't have to learn like they're going to take an entrance exam to a conservatory. Finally, music classes create an opportunity for detecting music talents at school. This contributes partly to development of the art of a nation. For example, many historical stories in the world recorded famous musicians who were educated in normal schools before. If there had not been musical classes at school, the world would not have had many famous musicians and singers. In a nutshell, music should be taught at school. It not only helps students relax but also creates an opportunity to detect music talents.

The school of the future is an interesting subject to discuss together. I think the school of the future is really different from the present. I think the school of the future is better than the school of the present. But at any time everything still has a good side and a bad side. On the good side I think the money for studying at school will be decreasing and it will be cheaper than at present schools. So everybody can study at their favorite school without worrying about money. The school facilities are going to improve a lot, so schools can educate their students effectively. I also think in the future everyone will be able to learn online. That makes it easier for us to study in the future than in the present. The conclusion is, in the future everyone will be able to learn things more effectively, easily, and cheaply than at a present school. On the negative side, the school of the future can be more expensive than present schools. That is awful for our children and our future.

Televisions are devices used only to entertain and, at least here in Brazil, they are not used to educate, which is really sad because TVs are powerful tools. I will tell you what you will see whenever you turn on a TV in Brazil. First, bad news. Here, television programs which talk about death, violence, robbery, and other bad things have a big audience. Second, soap operas, which are something similar to series, but they are a lot more boring and full of violence, discussions, death, robbery, and bad things. Third, sexuality, this is something considerably acceptable in the country where I live in and you will see things related to sex frequently on TV. In conclusion, TV can be used to educate, but it is not. Who has this kind of power uses it to manipulate and to influence people's life and their political opinion.

Most people in the world say that they cannot endure lies and they always tell the truth. More than half of these people lie in their daily lives. The way I see it does not hurt to tell little lies every now and then. Of course, I am totally against big lies, people should not tell lies which could affect other people's lives deeply. In the first place, if everyone always told the truth, it could hurt people. For example, if you ask a friend how it was after changing your hair, you would expect to hear a positive comment. Especially if this friend is not very close, you may not be prepared to hear a bad comment from her/him. In such cases, your acquaintances and friends generally do not want to offend you, so they do not hit the negative side of the situation in your face. Our close friends and family usually take on this role in our lives. Another major reason is that sometimes the occasions are not your business. So you lie when the interlocutor asks you something because you do not want to mingle in others' things. This behaviour is actually really great. I am concerned that when you mingle other people's situations, they may accuse you after they resolve the situation. In the end you could be the culpable one and they go about their lives as if nothing had happened. All things considered, sometimes lying is necessary for the good of people. If you are not in a position to tell the harsh truth in people's life, it is much better not to interfere in their affairs at all. In my opinion, it is a great mistake for people to lie to their immediate surroundings, other people are not that important.

A lot of people think that you don't need to learn English because they do not travel abroad. They even think that you can get everything translated, so why bother with learning a new language? The opposite is the truth! First of all, I would like to mention books. I agree that there are subtitles for more or less all movies and TV shows, however, there are so many books which are not even sold in your country. My life is so much better because I can read all of these foreign books and there is an infinite number of them. And aside from books, what about all of the podcasts?

Without math it would lack something. Because I believe that experiences and knowledge make us strong. I was going to say we should be strong when we are in trouble, but suddenly I realized even if we are not in trouble we need that. It would be more tasteful if we knew what kind of history is in where we travel or what kind of places have more possibilities to be enjoyed more. And if I have a chance to do it, I would like to learn a new language. There isn't enough time to learn a new language in one year, but actually it could be a good start for it. German would be nice.

We live in an age when many of us are more interested in getting lots of money rather than taking care of ourselves and having a healthy life. However, I don't totally agree with this way of living, if you're searching for ways to be happy, being rich is not the best option. In my opinion, being healthy is more important than being rich. Why? Because there is no point in having a lot of money if you're seriously sick, then you can't enjoy that money. Furthermore, life gives us pleasures which you don't need to spend money for and on the other hand, being rich only implicates having a stressful life. Despite this, currently people are only interested in making a lot of money, they work very hard and spend their lives trying to have lots of money. In conclusion, we should be focusing on taking care of our health. We need to learn that money does not buy happiness, true love, or peace of mind.

Music and studying music is a really interesting subject to discuss together. In my opinion, I think music is a really complicated and also very subtle thing that people invented. I think music is the language of feelings, that language can touch our soul. Studying music is not easy on it is very difficult to be good at music. So let me answer the question of do you have to learn an instrument that you mustn't learn an instrument but I encourage you to learn how to play an instrument you love. Then you will see that is an amazing thing you haven't done, I promise that you will not regret it. Learning how to play an instrument at a basic level maybe is a simple thing but if you want to be a master at the instrument you are playing then it is a different story. To be a master at the instrument you are playing is a really hard journey, it will not be easy at all. If you want to be a master at the instrument you are playing, you have to practise playing it regularly for a long time but it is worth it. I think learning how to play an instrument is a good thing to do when you have free time and learning to play an instrument can teach you how to be patient, and it also teaches you a lot of things that are very good for you and your life. Do you think music is the best way to touch someone's feelings? I think music is the language of feelings. When I listen to a piano piece I feel so peaceful and light, it makes me remember my childhood, isn't it beautiful? I can't imagine what we would have been like without music.

Write and Improve is a really useful program. I like it very much. It evaluates my sentences, so I can see how my writing level is. Basically, it gives me all kinds of tasks, and then I write sentences based on them. Afterwards, the programme will evaluate my sentences. If I made mistakes in my sentences, it will point them out for me. Thanks to this programme, I can easily practise my writing in English. Although there is no specific explanation about what is wrong with my sentence, I feel my writing is improving somewhat. It would be better if I had a tutor for my writing. It's okay with this program for now. Anyway, I'm going to use this from now on, so I can improve my writing skills in English every day. I think the important thing is consistency. If we want to be fluent in English, we have to be persistent and consistent. The more you write in English, the better you write in English. I would recommend my classmates to try Write and Improve, absolutely.

I don't disagree with the fact that children play video games. I believe there are pros and cons. Video games can help children develop many cognitive and physical abilities, such as motor coordination, critical thinking, self-control, the ability to think fast, and such. It is good because, currently, these abilities are becoming necessary for the next generations. Currently video games can be highly profitable. There are many competitions and the teams that will participate are composed of proof video game players. Therefore, if your children like playing video games you can show them this activity as a professional job. But there are some cons too. Children need limits, they cannot play video games all day long. Children need to work on their other abilities, the so-called soft skills. Children need to learn how to handle other people and how to solve problems. Children need to develop a sense of responsibility and video games cannot help with that.

Many IT- experts claim that the school system of today is very out of time and should have been modified even a long time ago. According to specialists, a modern school of tomorrow could look like this: Instead of carrying dozens of books, students will have a tablet which will bring an end to the severe burden of students. Every book and exercise will be contained in one thing. But there is even more. Writing on a blackboard will not be necessary anymore since the writing of the teacher is directly sent to the students' devices. And why are we even talking about teachers? Today, there are online platforms galore which provide thousands of students with video lessons and knowledge for free. There will be no teachers needed and marks will be determined by computer programs. It is very possible that schools will not exist in the future since everyone could learn at home. All in all, it can be said that the school of tomorrow is astonishing, but not far away. In industrial countries this will soon happen.

The space where you work is one of the most important aspects that can help you to be more productive and creative. Thinking about it many companies around the world have been studying many different types of offices that could better fit their employees. They have invested a lot of money and time to find the balance between what is the best for the people who work for them so this can be good for the company because people that are working happily can produce more and better. Some of the giant companies like Facebook and Google are in the top of mind when we think about a modern relationship between employer and employee. More than open concept offices, you will find offices there which have no desks as we used to find in the past. The change is not just about a physical space, it is much bigger. People who work for Google for example have no specific timetable to work they just need to do what they have to do, so that way they can do their own time to work. When we talk about how the way of working in offices has changed in the last few years, it can cause some confusion or perhaps we have the impression that every company in the world has changed and every office is now open concept and you will have great flexibility to work in your own way. But it is not exactly true. Even you work in one of these companies that was mentioned in the previous paragraph, probably you will hardly find some other companies that work using the same concept.

Hello everyone, It is a pleasure talk to you, today I want to tell you about my favourite food. The truth is it's a simple food, but I love it. My favourite food is sushi, I do not prepare it, when I look forward to eating it, it is necessary to ask for a delivery. I have two places to ask for it, one is economical and it has a good taste and another is expensive, but it has a lot of options and its taste is excellent, I love it. My husband thinks that it carries a little bit and he feels hungry soon, so he eats sushi with a little rice and a drink. For example, tonight we are going to eat a delicious plate of sushi, it has Dragon's Eye, Tiger's Eye and Roll Tempura, it will be our dinner because we are going to celebrate a new employment opportunity for him. I am overjoyed for him, I hope that he has big successes.

I am learning English for lots of reasons. One of them is that I was required to reach a certain level to graduate from university and I need proper English skills because of my rank now. And I will probably use English in my further career. However, there is something more about learning English. The most important aspect for me are books. I love reading and I read a lot but most of the books I am reading are in English only. I couldn't imagine not being able to read all those great pieces of literature. And the other important thing is, for example, Jocko's podcast. I have been listening to it for about five hundred hours with no subtitles. The thing is that no one will translate so many hours of the podcast, so the only way is to translate it on your own.

English language learners need to practise English on a daily basis. Therefore, they should find resources and tools to help them do so. One tool that could potentially help learners develop their writing skills is a service called Write and Improve. Although it has its limitations, I believe that this service will help the students write better. The website offers the student various writing prompts which are classified by students' writing abilities: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. These prompts are about many topics, such as education, art, technology, etc. In addition to the variety of topics, the website offers a variety of writing types, such as narrative, opinion, and argument. The students are guaranteed to find writing tasks that match their needs and interests. Moreover, the service provides feedback to the learners about every piece they write. After the student finishes writing the text according to the task instruction, they could submit it for evaluation, and after the evaluation, the student sees a score ranging from A1 to C2 and the sentences that could be improved highlighted using varying degrees of yellow. The darker the color, the more problems the sentence has. The students then use the feedback given to make changes and repeat the process until a sufficient quality has been achieved. Additionally, every evaluation is recorded in the system so that the user can see past task attempts and compare them to the most recent ones. Finally, I think Write and Improve is a very good service for those who are aiming to improve their written communication. The large number of tasks along with their diversity in topics and types ensure that there is always a suitable writing task for every writer. In addition, the feedback gives the writer guidance regarding where improvements could be made and an indication of their writing level. Nevertheless, the feedback is sometimes ambiguous and frustrating for some learners. For instance, erroneous sentences are highlighted, but no information about what the error is. Those who do not have full mastery of English grammar and mechanics will have difficulty determining possible ways to improve the sentences without relying on the help of teachers or other services. What's more, the feedback often is not accurate because it is fully automated using artificial intelligence. For example, it fails to mark basic spelling mistakes. Despite the issues mentioned, it is the best option available for students that do not have access to qualified teachers, and hopefully, it will improve in the near future.

There are two types of accommodation which students have to choose when they go to university. The first one is to stay with their families and the second one is to move out of home and live independently. It's hard to say which is better because both of them have their pros and cons. But to my way of thinking, I prefer the second. Firstly, it helps them grow up. Moving out of family and living independently also means that they have to do most things by themselves. For example, when they stay at home, their mothers make lunch and dinner for them. But when they live alone, they have to do it by themselves. They also learn how to spend money in a smart way. Secondly, they have a chance to relax and to be convenient to study and follow their educational life. If students live separately from their families, they will focus more on their studies and could get more achievements. On the contrary, living at home can lead to many bad results. Without the preparation for life's struggling, students can suffer from a deficiency of practical experiences. As I mentioned before, when they live independently, they have to roll with the punches. But when they live at home, their families usually solve almost their problems. That results in a lack of experiences when they have to face them alone. Of course, this way of living has some of its downsides as well. But, I believe it is still a better choice for students.

I think that having new teachers each year is better than having the same teacher for several years. Teachers all have their own ways of teaching, we cannot receive all techniques just from one teacher. So, I prefer to have a lot of teachers. But if I find my favourite teacher, I could possibly stick with that teacher. In any case, I have to take many lessons from many teachers. I don't think that having only one teacher is a bad idea. He or she would have more personal information about us. Because of this, they could teach us more suitable techniques. It is definitely a good thing. However, there is a limit to what one person can teach their student. I assume it is inevitable. Having a lot of teachers could be better because it provides more methods of studying. We may find more suitable study methods for us. This is why I think that students benefit more from having new teachers each year.

We live in a world that is changing very fast. What was considered trendy a decade ago is now old-fashioned. Do we still need to learn foreign languages in times of artificial intelligence? Maybe we should just trust our robots to do this job? I will try to answer this question in the essay below. Some futurologists claim that learning languages will become obsolete in the next few years. Tools like Google Translator keep improving and people who don't know English can easily communicate with English speakers. Future developments in this area are highly possible. A group of scientists have been working on a special chip which will be located in the brain. This chip will allow users to translate from all languages. Although all this sounds promising, there are still some serious doubts. First of all, Google Translator is still not perfect. In the case of English it is effective, but not so much regarding other languages. Language brain chips will initially be very expensive and people will be afraid to use them. In my opinion, this kind of tool would not be commonly used before 2050.

In contemporary society we are told to always seek the truth. It does not matter how hurtful this truth may be - most of the people would advise you to never lie, even when it would make a situation better. Does this really apply to everyday life? Let's find out. I'd like to recall one specific example - you are a nurse helping with an old couple - one of them is on their deathbed, even though they are not really aware of it. What is the best to tell their significant other? They are already in pain and agony, why would you make the situation even worse? In this situation, and situations similar to that described, I think the best decision is to tell a partial truth. You shouldn't pull them down by saying there is no hope, but convincing them everything will be fine wouldn't be ethical either. But what about other examples - because for sure there are a lot of circumstances when it would be the best to just tell the truth (such as cheating or playing truant). For me, rethinking everything can be really refreshing and helpful while making serious decisions. All things considered - the truth can be valuable and most of the times it is, but you have to observe the whole situation and then calculate how much good for both sides there is.

The vast majority of the world thinks death is terrible. They are afraid of the post-death process and leaving their loved ones behind. They do not think it through but actually resisting death is an instinctive act. The way I see it, both sample have their own advantages and people's choice may change according to their personality. To begin with, a short but intense life is perfect for people who just live in the moment and don't care or are ambitious people. We can view this issue from different angles. From the ambitious part, we can say that a short life but filled with achievements is perfect for them. Such people do not have to live long, they will be the happiest in the world when they achieve their goals. If they live long and they cannot achieve anything after a while, they can be frustrated, devastated and angry. This kind of life will be torture for them and they can pull their loved ones into misery with themselves. From the other view, people who just live in the moment and don't care about other things do not waste their lives with responsibilities, work or anything that would interfere with what they want. They just need to fulfill their daily needs and concurrently with have fun. Such people do not want to live long and calmly, the majority of them do not want to get old. On the other hand, I think most people want to live long and calmly. They want steady jobs, happy wedlock and above all they want peace. Such people know how to be happy with the little things and do not seek adventure in daily life. They prefer spending quiet days with loved ones and things and doing different things occasionally. All in all, I would not prefer either. The way I see it we should mix these two lifestyles. We must live our youth to the fullest and live a quiet life after a certain age. We have to go where our hearts take us when we are young and be open to different things, try everything we can try. When we get older and our responsibilities increase, we must lead a quieter lifestyle. Of course, this does not mean leaving all our wishes behind, we should not give up from things that will make us happy. This is my point of view on this subject. Everyone chooses a lifestyle according to their character .

I would practice on the speaking website. And there was a teacher and I asked him to help me with my writing skills. After that he wanted me to send some examples of my writing. He said that I have a way to go for progress on my writing skill. That was the day I found Write and Improve. Since then this website became my first choice for writing training. It is my favourite because of its features. I can set a timer and I don't think of any topics. These are so helpful and they save time for me because it takes so much time to find a topic. I believe that they do this in order to new learners. Initially I didn't understand the checking system. It was colouring the lines yellow and it was rating my skills A1 to C2. Then I searched and found it. It indicates that some problem could have been in that sentence. I was making so many mistakes but thanks to this application I realized my mistakes and I have decreased them. After you check your mistakes, you correct them and you can check from the menu. Actually I haven't seen any difficulties except the page orientation. When you check your text, the checked text order isn't on the same line as the original text. I can't always match the lines between the two screens. Maybe it could have been better if it was synchronised with the original one. I recommend it for everyone especially for intermediate students.

Nowadays, technology is advancing so fast, we are able to get a lot of information wherever we are and whenever we want. This easy access to information has benefited many students and schools. However, some people think this technology will replace the traditional ways of learning. Firstly, students don't need to spend lots of time in libraries or schools don't need to get lots of books for their pupils. You can obtain electronic books on the internet and check them by tablets, computers, and even on cell phones. Nevertheless, these kinds of devices won't replace traditional books. Some reasons for this are the fact that not all electronic books have a good transcription, good books cost a lot of money, and others are not available in electronic format. To sum up, having electronic books has advantages, such as you being able to access your favorite books on your computer, but even with these advantages electronic books have not replaced traditional books. Many students and professors prefer this kind of reading, because many times the information is more reliable.

I've got to say that I really love books and I've got my own little library. I buy my books and I am not into reading books on Kindle. However, at universities it is something different. During my university days it was necessary to have some books from our library although I rarely used them. I think that it is much more practical to have all the materials on a computer so you can find anything with a quick search and you can copy the most important information and make your own tools for studying. The problem is that you rarely need to study just one book. You have to switch between them and it is much faster on your computer screen. There is so much information that you have to process those days and everything is constantly changing. And that is another important aspect. You can update your online documents, but you can't print all books every time there is something new. Those are reasons why I believe that computers and tablets should replace books in schools or at least those books which contain frequently updated information.

Indeed, some video games can have a negative impact on children. But, in general, video games are not necessarily bad for children. There are a lot of educational games in the world, for example. Children may expand a lot of their vocabulary through playing video games. They could learn social skills in some cases. Moreover, playing video games is safe in terms of the children's physique. To play outside can be dangerous, especially for children. Besides, I think that forbidding children from playing video games can have a rather negative impact if the children want to play video games. They could feel under pressure because of that. Of course, playing video games all the time is bad for their health. There is a problem that children do not play outside nowadays. They should play outside sometimes so they can do some exercise. In conclusion, we should not forbid the children from playing video games. The thing is, we should watch out for the video games that our children are playing. If the game is not suitable for our children, then we must tell our children not to play it. When it's not the case, we should let the children play freely.

This is a real problem that we have to solve. As a city person we can't close our eyes to rural areas. On the other hand we can't close our for doctors. Nobody has to work where they don't want. It is a two-sided problem. Rural folk want to get treated well and the doctors want good life standards. In my opinion, that can't be solved between rural folk and the doctors. It issues government and the health department. If the wages depend on where you work, it has to be changed. The country has to be one body. From village to city centers. Some just don't want only the money. They want to wander around, visit some museum, go shopping. And they also want to feel safe when they walk. This all interests the government. If you want doctors to go where the mission is, you should provide them with these standards. If you decided to do it, it will take time. That is for sure. One life could be wasted while you are developing the murals. So you have to assign enough doctors when you are in the process. This could be provided by incentives. If you say, I will give more money for rural doctors for a while, someone could utilize it. It could be a chance for newly graduated students. And I wonder if the health department announces that they will assign new doctors to the murals, could it help for development? For instance, in my country if you work in the government, you have to work in the east part which is the murals for five years minimum. And if you provide good life standards, it becomes like a chance to save money, especially for youngsters. I hope that every member of a country feels equal.

Hello everyone, Today, I want to write about the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad. I will mention my opinion. Studying abroad has a lot of advantages as 1. People get to know other cultures and features about food, languages, buildings, nature, laws, clothes, weather, devices, drinks, money, animals, plants, history, etcetera. 2. People can travel to other cities nearby, because they can use buses, the underground, cars, motorcycles, bikes, or they can walk due to it not being expensive and they can find offers for tourists to go between cities. 3. People study and know the different levels of grade, if they search for a degree, it is good for them in their country of origin. 4. People can study and learn other languages because they need to speak to other people. 5. People can enjoy the seasons, because many countries have no seasons. However, it is important to mention there is a big disadvantage, which is people are generally alone in a country so far away from their house, so they can feel sadness, fear, discrimination, poverty, hunger, etcetera. In conclusion, I think that studying abroad is a big opportunity and it is necessary to try it. Unfortunately, I cannot travel to another country, because I am poor and my family does not have money to pay for my tickets and me staying there. Now, I am thirty-four and have a good job, so I can think about travelling, but only for a holiday. I hope to do it, this year or very soon.

Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to you because of your last proposal. I am glad that you care and that you can identify the current problem. The proposal banning the use of mobile phones would prevent us from the "digital demention.." In my opinion it is may be a little bit too radical. The mobile phones in the restaurants are destroying our culture and our ability to communicate with each other. We do not talk any more. Although we sit at one table it is like there is a mile long gap between us. On the other hand nothing is black and white. The phones protect customers from exaggerated prices. You can easily find the recommended price of a product and you can compare the price. And public transport is another area where it can be useful to use mobile phone. It is true that some people are disturbing and they act like selfish immature people with their loudspeakers blazing. But you can find important information about your trip on the internet and most importantly the trip can be so long and you can use that time or waste it. You can do both with your phone. You can work on it or you can read or at least play some music. But on the other hand you can waste that time on social media and it is not desirable at all. I appreciate your work and I believe that you know what are you doing. Best regards, Kuba

One of my favourite films is "Manhattan" by Woody Allen. I think this movie is well written, and the story is enthralling. Allen's sarcasm is at its best. You can find a love story, and a reflection upon friendship, but you find a picture of the 80s as well. The soundtrack is really great, and a very good example of this is in the movie's intro, when the images are perfectly synchronized with the "Rhapsody in Blue" by Gershwin. The movie is in black and white, and this is because the same main character said: New York City is a city in black and white. I agree completely with this.

Why do I want to learn English? For several reasons. English is very important for every job. Even though you don't need to communicate with foreign people, now every firm wants you to know English. I agree, but not completely and not always. But this is it, and I try to adapt myself. English is also the first international language and it is indispensable if and when you travel abroad. And I like to travel abroad, so I need to speak English. English is important when buying flight tickets, reserving a hotel, ordering at a restaurant, etc. Furthermore, I like to read a lot, and so many books are not translated into Italian. Above all, many essays about technology and science are published in English and not translated into Italian. So I need to understand and read in English to read all those books. English is important to do almost everything today.

Sports should play an important part in everyone's lives, but unfortunately, they don't. Physical activity keeps both the body and the mind healthy and positively impacts one's life. The negative effects of an inactive lifestyle should not be ignored because they affect more than we are led to believe. Besides the obvious effects, obesity and the health problems it causes, the lack of physical activity also affects the mind, leading to unhappiness and unproductivity. First of all, doing sports activities at least three times per week is enough to make a change in one's life. These activities would provide the most benefits especially if they were between classes at school. Taking a physical activity break between chemistry and maths, for example, gives you a break from mental activities that require you to focus and give you some time to clear your mind and prepare for the next class. An active lifestyle leads to an active mind. This has also been proven by scientists. While working out, the body releases endorphins that trigger a positive feeling. So, there are no disadvantages of increasing students' and school children's physical activity. Second of all, it is vitally important to make everyone understand the dangers of an unhealthy lifestyle. The way we live our lives is the root of all of our problems. An inactive lifestyle will never allow anyone to become the best version of herself or himself and it might actually cause more serious problems, like depression or physical illnesses. Young people are most impressionable and that is why it is strongly recommended to teach students and school children about the importance of an active life as soon as possible. All things considered, there is no doubt that sports activities are as important as mental activities and they should be mandatory in school.

I agree with the people who believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Knowledge about animals is very important to people. People can respect animals more because of this knowledge. Moreover, animals in a zoo are not in such bad conditions. Usually, they are treated really carefully so that they do not feel stressed out. On the other hand, animals in nature are basically in very brutal conditions. Some animals cannot survive in such an environment. Thus, I think animals do not have to belong in nature and it is not necessarily wrong to keep them in zoos. The important thing is to respect those animals and nature, but not let them be free without thinking. We are the same as them in terms of living things on the earth. Let us not ban zoos and let us keep them comfortable. And then, let people learn more about them.

I think that studying abroad is a really great thing in the main. The students who go to study abroad could learn various things from it. For example, they could be independent because they have to live on their own. Not to mention they have to speak in another language, so they could improve their language skills. Moreover, they could learn about the cultures of the country where they are studying. They could even make friends in those countries. These experiences would be precious without doubt. However, I think that there are some problems. The cost of studying abroad would be very high. Some students could not afford to go and live abroad. They would have to borrow some money because of that. What is more, they could suffer from loneliness. They would not be able to meet their family and friends back in their country. I do not know if they could persevere. In conclusion, I guess that studying in another country for a time during high school or university is a great idea. In spite of that, there are some problems. The experience in another country outweighs the problems. The experience in another country would certainly be a lifelong treasure.

I believe that zoos could be good places to learn more about animals. However, the current model used to explore this business is not effective. There are few zoos that are good examples of how to conduct this business. The exploitation of images and the visits to animals are important for the generation of profits, and these profits should be used to fund research that protects and preserves the animals. It is also necessary to study how to improve the methods of reproduction of theses animals in captivity. If these studies are effective, perhaps the new-born animals can be introduced into safe areas, such as tropical forests or other natural areas. The main idea is to try to recover and preserve these safe areas, so the animals could live in a free space. As a result of this effort and these studies, people could visit these safe areas and observe an animal in its natural habitat. Consequently, conservation would help scientists achieve the goal of preserving many animal species.

I believe that working with a group makes me productive. I would say open design offices are more effective than the closed offices. But I also value research about human thinking styles. There must be some research about it. Because productivity is one of the most important things in the business area. Productivity and efficiency are the key to mass production. If we downgrade to a human, not a machine, it would help us to create more comfortable zone. If a human is not in their comfort zone, they can't think properly. If flexibility of thinking isn't provided, workers can't work with high efficiency. A professional worker doesn't want to work in these conditions. While you are losing your workers, you can also lose time. And all we know that, time can't be taken back. If we value our workers, we can gain more than we gave. As I declared, I would create an open design office for more efficiency and for a more comfortable zone. It came from the research that I read. It is actually called herd psychology. We feed from what we eat. That's certain. And I believe that our reading, our listening and our watching shape our mind. If we see a group of hardworking people, we try hard not to be a black sheep in the herd. It actualizes subconsciously. But on the other hand, being a single white sheep in the herd also harasses us. So we should mission our workers properly. We should warn the black sheep and at the same time we should appreciate white sheep. A summary about my thoughts is that we should utilize academic resources about the human thinking system. After that we should organize our office in suitable forms. Awards for hard workers also could provide an example to be a good worker.

Obviously, to be healthy is more important than to be rich. However, in all countries and all societies wealth helps to be healthy. It happens not only in countries like the US, without a welfare state, but in countries like the UK or member states of the EU as well: those who have a good job and a good wage eat healthier and have better treatments. If you have money you have access to private and better facilities. Furthermore, if you pay well you have a faster and better service, also in public health facilities. And this is not a matter of corruption: health has a cost, and the public could not afford it as best as it can ever. The same problem is with healthy food: the poor can buy cheap food, and cheap food is dangerous, unhealthy, fat, rich in preservatives and sugars. By contrast, rich people can buy organic and safer and healthier food, because this food is often very expensive.

Studying medicine these days has become commonplace and necessary , so some doctors study medicine in order to obtain a fortune. While others believe that being a doctor is a humanitarian job. This essay will discuss both sides and will draw my personal opinion. On one hand, when you want to study medicine and get a lot of money, this is your right, but the first purpose is helping poor people, to illustrate, human nature tends to collect money, so, you can obtain money through your job, additionally the volunteer in your free time. In addition, volunteering is a great occupation , especially when treating people's diseases , for instance , all the doctors have three days in the week so they can help the people and visit rural areas, because in the countryside there are elderly people. So that will be a big benefit to humanity , such as a philanthropic organization. On the other hand, most nations suffer because hospitals are very far away , because the government build institutions according to the population density. Usually , rural areas are on the borders of the state , they don't contain a high population density . In conclusion, after a careful analysis of both viewpoints, I believe in the importance if medical jobs, but must people must not neglect the human side.

Nowadays we do not have any support for children to learn musical instruments although this is really important for them mentally and physically. When we look back in time, schools used to teach music to their students. Sadly, in our time this is not true anymore but, in some places this is still a requirement and, at least for me, this is really good. Recently I have started to learn to play the violin and I need to confess it is really amazing how we can develop new skills even though we are 'old'. After this new experience I have discovered that I am able to learn anything I want to and that that story about children's learning process being better than adults' process is a lie and I am saying this after experiencing this on my own. So please give yourself a chance to learn how to play any kind of instrument, it will be more than rewarding.

Interest in the design of work stations has become commonplace , so some people care about where they work frequently, because they believe that impacts on one's psychological state. While others believe it's not important the decoration in a place or how the style of decoration is, because they think the purpose of a job is money more than work. This essay will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal opinion. On one hand, most employees prefer working in a new place which has modern decor and contains entertainment, for example, evelotion the technical world during to high norms human. In addition, the work environment has become more care than the work, for instance, in the past the employers were more interested in the customer and eager to comfort them, and they neglected the employees. This was a sticking point. But now the situation has become different, to illustrate, the interest in employees has increased, and in all aspects, for example providing all the means of comfort, entertainment such as coffee devices, a well-ventilated place and especially a place to relax. So that's why some think that psychological health is important for them, because they can be creative in their job. On the other hand is the arrangement, a must for business owners balancing between the number of employees and distance from the place and increasing the salary for workers outside the institution. In conclusion, after a careful analysis of both viewpoints, I believe that a healthy environment at work has positive effects on the workers in it.

Languages represent a form of communication among people. They are a part of history and the traditions of a country. We could not define ourselves as human unless languages existed. Learning to speak a foreign language is the bridge which links two or more populations. It is as important as speaking one's own language. However, there are some important differences with respect to the past. In fact, people were not used to travelling as much as today. Basically, this is the reason why a person did not need to learn a foreign language. Moreover, schools did not have a sufficient number of language lessons, so people had no solid language skills. Thus, learning a foreign language was not an important matter in the past. Nowadays, a foreign language must be learned not only when we are going to travel abroad, but also when we are applying for a job. Indeed, more and more national and international companies are requiring proficient speaking skills in one foreign language at least. For instance, English and French are the most relevant languages. If you know more languages, you will have many more possibilities. This is the future!

Studying abroad is a great opportunity to improve several skills, such as language, educational, professional, and personal skills as well. Depending on the country in which the person is going to study, he or she may study at a high-level institution. And it can make all the difference to the formation and preparation of this person. Certainly this person will be better prepared to apply to the best jobs in the future. Studying abroad is the best way to improve and get confidence to explore a new language at a high level. Being exposed to a different environment obligates the person to make a great effort to improve his abilities. Sometimes, studying abroad can be the best way to get well-paid jobs, so that the person can build a new lifestyle. So improving their quality of life is feasible. On the other hand, some people have problems to adapt themselves to a new country and to a new culture. These problems are due to a lack of confidence and a necessity to stay close to relatives and friends. Although living abroad can cause difficulties, I believe the effort is worth it.

If your watching TV don't only watch to entertain yourself, watch something useful to help you with your life and educate yourself.

Some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. Why do they make this choice ? I think that it is easier to learn a new language. When students go to a new country, they should learn the new language to understand the native students and courses at the university. But, it is more difficult to understand courses. And, being in a new country can be sad. In fact, sometimes, students can be lost! They don't know the new language enough. Even if the communication with native students is not easy, it's very interesting to discover a new culture. And, the foreign students can also share their own culture with some native people. I think that all students that are abroad need to learn how to live in a new country. That's a challenge. But this challenge allows us to improve and become an adult. That's all!

Everyone has had a favourite thing since he was a child. A colour, an animal, a book, or a season. In particular, the favourite season of the year is said to be the expression of our behaviour. In this article, I am going to explain to you what my favourite season of the year is and why. It is winter. I love it because I like to listen to the wind blowing against the window and look at the snowy land on the coldest days. It makes me feel relaxed. It is very special for me; I have many happy memories of my childhood in that season. When I was a child, I used to go out with my younger sister to play with snow, rolling on the snowy ground, for example. The winter is very often associated with Christmas time, one of the best moments of the year. In fact, I love opening Christmas gifts with my sister and my parents on Christmas morning. What an exciting moment! I am looking forward to discovering what present I have received. I consider it is still the best period of the year.

I truly hope that each parent has a right to raise their children the way they find appropriate. However, feelings and beliefs are not only difficult to articulate, but also very individualistic. Therefore, looking at what data tells us is crucial. Like any other other tool, video games can be put to good or bad use. For example, if young children play a game designed for teenagers, it will harm their psyche. That's because games can evoke strong emotions, and providing them to a defenseless child is a bad idea. It can lead to anxiety or aggression in the long term. Another harmful way is to allow our children to play whenever they like. If there are no restrictions in place, children will play for the whole day. And sometimes even the night. In contrast, educational games are very useful and desirable. We play video games because they are fun, and if we can make learning fun, the success is inevitable. To summarise my short answer, I'm for a reasonable and controlled use of video games. Not only for educational purposes, but also for pleasure.

Zoos are a very good place to learn about animals. Imagine a family of six going to the jungle to see a gorilla, giraffe, or a lion. This task would be both logistically and financially challenging. And for most people it can only remain an unfulfilled desire. Zoos provide a taste of such an experience at a lower cost and a greater convenience. Not to mention an unparalleled level of security. You say that people believe that animals belong in nature and this is true. However, there are people who believe that animals can be kept in captivity with no harm done to them. They even say that it is better for them, because they don't have to struggle just to get by, as everything is provided for them. Including safety, which is impossible in the wild. Yet again we are discussing people's beliefs. How can we actually decide whose beliefs are right, and whose are wrong?

I went to Paris, France ten years ago. It was the most interesting holiday to me. Before that time, I had never been abroad. I remember that I was very excited at the time. I love French culture, especially the art and cuisine. Also, I got on an airplane for the first time at that time. By the way, I went there with my family and friends. My friends were excited about the holiday as well. In Paris, firstly, I went to a hotel that I was staying in during the holiday. The hotel was really beautiful, classy, and magnificent. I was really exhausted right after arriving there because of the jet lag. The next day, I went to Disneyland and really enjoyed myself there. There were a lot of attractions. On another day, I went to the Louvre, the famous museum. I looked at many famous pictures and sculptures at the museum. Besides, I ate a number of delicious meals. I love French cuisine very much. Definitely, I will never forget these precious times. I would love to visit France again. And this was the really important holiday that I went on.

I certainly think exercise is important for our health. It is a fact that is proven by scientific research. However, are there things that are more important? Yes, I guess that there are indeed more important things than exercise. For example, the food which we eat in everyday life is more important. There is a famous proverb, "You are what you eat." I think it is true. If you do not take in sufficient nutrients, you are going to be sick. I assume people tend to have unhealthy food these days. For instance, they eat a lot of junk food. They should eat more healthy food. Another important thing for our health is sleep. I believe that sleeping is underestimated by most people. But actually, it could be the most important thing for our health. We could get refreshed by enough sleep. It is also beneficial to our brain as well. If we feel stressed out, it would affects our health. But sleeping can get it out of our mind. We have to get more sleep absolutely. Although I have written the above, exercise is also important for our health without doubt. We have to think about everything.

Dear Anna, Thank you for your letters. I am writing to tell you about my favourite film. The film is "Miracle in cell no 7," and it tells the story of a mentally disabled man who has a daughter that he adores. He is wrongly imprisoned for murdering and raping a seven year-old girl. But he is a very kind man who has been misunderstood by his cellmates. After a while, they find out that he is innocent, so they help him smuggle his daughter into the prison. I won't spoil the end of the film for you . I strongly recommend watching this film. The most interesting thing about that film is that it's joyful and sad at the same time. I hope you watch and enjoy it. Write soon. Best regards, Mariam

Nowadays, it is true that many people are thinking that living a shorter life is much more intense and they are going to live the rest of their lives in this sad way but I consider that living until 100 years old will bring many good things in humans' lives and I can tell you how. On the one hand, the vast majority of people are trowing their time doing nothing, just working, and there isn't any kind of pleasure in this. For example, they can risk their lives and the time will be shorter than for people who live for 100 years. On the other hand, it will have you in hysterics when you always hear, " I like my life like this, going to parties, watching movies all the time , exploring new places and meeting new people, so I'm living my best life" but in my humble opinion I can say that only God can give us all the time we need. In addition to this and from my personal experience, I can say that I prefer to choose the first choice: living a long, calm life until 100 years old (if God lets us) because you can't go from this life until you did everything for your life and your family's too. So keep it simple, healthy, brave and also be proud of yourself always!

I have realized that in this website you generally want me to say some certain declaring. I don't like it at all. If I am a not a capable person to analyse the topic I hesitate to say something absolute. But I have another option too. If we come to the topic all we know that music affects our brain. It makes different parts of our brains work. They say the brain has muscles in it. So if we don't practise it could get lazy very easy. But on the other hand, forcing is not an eligible thing to do. If I want to be an engineer, I may not want to learn something about music. I don't have to listen to music either. School principals should decide it for their own students'. If you ask my opinion, I would say if it is optional, not like obligation, I would want it as an option. Actually, I am an engineering student. I don't even need to know something about classical music but actually I would like to know small things about it. It would help me in conversation with some people. It could help me outside of my major. But I value personal interaction with others. It could be supportive to maintain in conversation. Nobody can say music is an unnecessary thing. Some say it is nutrition of our soul. But I wouldn't support if it is an obligation. Students can't be forced for something they don't want to do. It could create some barrier for students. Rap, jazz, sound, hearing, piano, violin, guitar are good.

It is always an adventure to travel to another country. Studying abroad is especially relevant, because you get to stay in one place for longer. That gives you the opportunity not only to get a taste of, but also to get to know local people and their culture. Furthermore, you make friends while studying. And some friendships are very precious, and may last for years. And there is also a chance for a romance, and maybe something even more serious. Another benefit of studying abroad is learning the language. Studying abroad gives students firsthand experience, not available during the lessons with a teacher. When you are exposed to language most of the time, you learn the best. On the other hand, you will be far away from your home. That means not seeing your family and friends for an extended period of time. That may be even harder if you leave your boyfriend or girlfriend behind. The new environment and culture may not be to your liking either. There may be these little things that you'll miss. Like standing in a queue, hugging and kissing your colleagues, or even the products you might not be able to buy abroad.

Schools in a new reality Is it only me or you have had the same complaints about your school? Imagining the future of school takes place on every level. We used to dream of more colorful buildings, better teachers, less homework, and diversity in subjects. Now it's coming true. School has been getting closer to the futuristic vision of it. For instance, the first difference will be the use of technology. Tablets, computers, and robots will not be only used by teachers but mainly by students. Paper notebooks will be long gone to the trash. Another point is creating smaller classes. Psychological studies have shown that humans are not able to stay focused in a group of 30 people. Taking this into consideration, schools will be reducing the number of students in a group. In addition, societies will realize how great a role nature plays in our life. Classes will be organised outdoors in order to show children the beauty of the world. However, there will be definitely no changes in grouping kids by age. Governments like it. It is easier to control people. A teacher will probably stay as the head of class.

Dear Members of the town council, I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with your idea of making restrictions connected with mobile phones and their usage in public places. First and foremost, you do not specifically have any reasons for these regulations. As far as I am informed, there has not been a single problem with individuals using their mobile phones outside. It does not bother anybody in particular or cause any major conflicts. You also claimed in your previous press-conferences that you will not implement any restrictive measures that would significantly limit the freedom of your citizens. Last but not least, I decided to carry out an online survey on my website to find out what citizens think. Following the survey among the citizens of this town carried out online, 90 percent of teenagers showed a full disagreement with the idea of not being able to use mobile phones in public. About 75 percent of adults think that it is not necessarily needed and it would only cause arguments and chaos. When it comes to seniors, only 25 percent answered that they are against the idea as they usually do not use mobile phones much and do not care much. As it was shown in the survey, not only me but a majority of citizens do not agree with banning mobile phones in public. I hope this matter receives your immediate attention. Yours sincerely, Dana

Second, I mainly want to improve writing skills; this area is my weak point. I need to make some effort to improve my ability to talk more fluently with other people, I mean, sometimes when I am talking I have to stop and think about what I will say, and it does not sound natural, or like a native English speaker.

We are now living in a global and international world. In the past, travelling was a more difficult thing. But now, we can travel to almost any other country we want to go to. This is definitely fantastic. Then, what about travelling in the future? I think that it is going to be easier and more affordable. We might not even need passports. There could not be any borders in the future. I fancy that it would be great for everyone in the world. It would help us all in many ways, too. For example, we could easily meet our family and friends in other countries. Let's see public transport. There would probably be far faster transport. I guess that there could be space rockets in the future. We might be able to go to the moon then. There is definitely no border and no country. We are all just humankind. Travelling is just travelling. Despite what I have written above, I actually suppose that there is no difference in the future of travel. Dreams are just dreams.

Hello everyone, Here, today, I am thinking about how the ways of travelling can be in the future. Well, let's begin: First, I should mention, I am 34 years old and all my life I have been in Colombia, an underdeveloped country, where all people only take the bus, car, plane, bike, motorcycle, or boat. It is dependent on the place where they live and their economic situation. For example, in Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, most people take the bus and 'transmilenio' (it is an articulated bus, it works with some special conditions; this permits a faster movement inside the city, but it is more expensive). Other people use cars and motorcycles, and finally there are people who take bikes to go to work. The government says it is important to make another way to travel inside the city. The project is to make a train line that crosses the whole city. This proposal has not been received well by the population, because we think it is a bad project, where the government is going to spend a lot of money and the city will not be better. Furthermore, this brings more social problems, such as insecurity, dirt, structural problems in buildings, extra costs, etcetera. In conclusion, I think the future of travelling in my city is not going to have other means of transport, because the infrastructure is pretty deficient.

You know that I'm a down-to-earth person, and I believe that what I have just written encapsulates my desires and observations.

Books are instruments of learning and contain a lot of knowledge. You can touch books and feel their texture. On the one hand, I think books are very necessary in schools and universities. They are the essence of education. When I was a child I preferred to read physical books rather than e-books, computers, or tablets. I was born in the age of technology, but I prefer to read in a book rather than on a computer. On the other hand, I think computers and tablets have helped society. Each minute we get more education with computers. Children learn better with computers because they learn visually. They learn by watching videos, singing, and doing exercises on platforms. Young adults at university search for information on computers rather than in books. They take notes on computers and tablets. I think it is faster than writing by hand. In conclusion, I think computers and tablets are very necessary for society, but books must never disappear.

Travel may be a field that will not disappear in the world. In other words, travel will develop more and more in the future. Have you thought about the future of travel? Indeed, in what ways do you believe travel will be different in the future and in what ways might it still be the same? In this essay, these topics are discussed. Regarding the different things that will change in travel, I believe that humans will tend to visit places which are close to nature. It can be clearly seen that people care about the environment and nature. That's why, they will choose to enjoy a natural landscape instead of commercial places. In addition, technology 4.0 has been developed and customers will book, set up, and pay through high-technology solutions instead of manually. Many things, combining marketing, storage, and booking will be managed digitally. Everything will solved quickly and immediately. Regarding the things where travel will not be different, I think the way to serve customers will be the same as before. Clearly, meals, spa services, and transport will still be the same. I see that serving now is ok for the visitors.

How do I like to sleep? It is a difficult question because it depends on the occasion. Firstly, I like to travel. I sleep in hotels, motels and private houses. For me, after all of the day, priority is silence and I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room. But, if I choose a shared room, when I want to save some money, it isn't possible because everyone likes going to sleep at different times. Secondly, I'm a teacher and twice a year I organize trips for my students. We are together for four or five days and we sleep in a youth hostel. Then, I haven't slept in a dark and quiet room but only in a small, light room. Thirdly, in my own house I definitely prefer dark, quiet rooms, without light at night. Then I sleep fast and I sleep from seven to eight hours. Additionally, the window in my bedroom has a view onto the street. Sometimes my neighbours turn on the lights and wake me up, so I have bought window blinds. In conclusion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, it is healthier for me and I can rest after all of the day. But it depends on the occasion, what I showed on the free example.

I think it's important to learn English. I have reasons why it is important to me. 1) When I'm older I'm going to go on holidays to other countries and most of the countries speak English. 2) The language is fascinating and easy to learn. 3) I have to learn it because my parents can't speak English and I see how hard that is when we go on holiday to other countries. 4) England is really nice! I want to go to England when I'm older with my husband. English is a world language, if you go to other countries, and you want to communicate with people who live there then it's definitely important to speak English. I have English classes, so I don't have a choice I need to learn English, otherwise I will fail. I hope more people think like this. English is really important.

I remember that my best holiday ever was when I went to Switzerland with my family. I went to the Catania airport on 24 December, and I landed at Milan Malpensa airport the same day. It was Christmas Eve, me and my family were alone, and we decided to go to Turin because we have cousins that live there, and we celebrated Christmas Eve and Christmas all together. On 26 December, we finally went to Switzerland. We left Turin and passed through the San Gotthard tunnel. In the evening, we finally arrived at my cousin's home. I met my uncle Yurg and his other friends, I was very happy. He gave me a gift and when I opened it I was very amazed because there were two games for Nintendo 3ds which I loved. In the next days, we did a lot of things, but surely the most beautiful was when we went to the waterfalls; I was really amazed. This was my best trip.

I think zoos are good for seeing animals. Of course, it isn't so nice for the animals when they have to live in small enclosures. You can learn a lot in a zoo. For example, what the animals look like or how they behave. Moreover, you can see a lot of animals for little money. When there were no zoos, you had to travel to various countries to see the animals. That wouldn't be good for your ecological footprint. In addition, a zoo is very nice for kids. They like to see the different animals. I think it would be the best if the animals had a large enclosure and their normal conditions to live. Moreover, it is important that someone who knows the animals cares about them. So it would be better for the animals. I think for school classes, which are learning something about exotic animals, it is very good to see the animals in real life. I know it is something different from the open wilderness, but it is a good compromise.

I have a lot of reasons for that. 1) My mood is so much better in summer because it's hot. 2) We always go on holiday in summer and I love holidays. We wanted to go to Turkey.

It's never cold, so I love to walk with my dog. 4) Summer clothes are so much better than winter clothes. In winter I'm always grumpy and angry. That's also a reason why I love the summer. I don't even understand why people love winter, it's so cold, and it gets dark in one minute.

There is no doubt these days that technology is spreading to every place in the world. The question is, will they replace books with computers and tablets? In this essay, I am going to talk about the reasons why books cannot be replaced by computers and tablets. I think because of this pandemic they should replace books with computers and tablets. When the pandemic is over they should go back to books again. The main reason given to support this claim is to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives by staying home. Too many have died in this pandemic, hopefully it will end soon. In conclusion, using lots of technology might damage your eyes. Therefore, I believe that using books is better and healthier for people. I advise all people to not use computers and tablets more than books after this pandemic.

Dear Anton, Thank you for your last email. Nice to hear from you and that you liked cooking and tasted new meals. What is your favourite new food? Could you write me any recipes, please? I will experience cooking new meals and maybe in the future I will become a cook. Who knows! For me, absolutely the number one food is Italian food. I love pasta with various sauces. Every weekend, I prepare dinner for my family and pasta is their favourite meal. I like to bake pizza, especially with tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages, cucumber and additionally a lot of cheese. Once a month I like to eat out of town with my friends and we go to an Italian restaurant. But I prefer to eat at home, I like to talk with my family, friends and taste mine and my mum's recipes. We eat together on Friday evening and often on Saturday midday, rarely during the week when we must work. I like Italian food for three reasons. First, Italian food is healthy and delicious, cooks use some vegetables. Second, I like to travel to Italy, so if I can't fly and smell pasta and pizza in Rome, Milan or Venice, I try to eat Italian food at home or at a restaurant. Third, Italian food has enormous power, integrates people, encourages conversation and works relaxing. Moreover, Anton, do you know anyone who does not like Italian food? I don't think so. I can't wait for your response, Anton. Maybe one day you will visit me in Poland and taste my meals? I invite you, whenever you want! Yours sincerely, Kristina.

Schools are set up to educate students. Traditionally, there are teachers and students in a school. They must go to school almost every day until they graduate or move to another school. They must get up in the morning in most cases. Some students have their lunch at school. Others have their lunch elsewhere. They ought not to go home until after school. Almost every person in the world has experienced such stuff. I always doubt whether or not students should go to school physically. I think schools' duty is to teach their students itself. They do not have to attend schools really as long as they study what their school teaches them. Moreover, there are online study courses everywhere on the internet nowadays. I assume students in the world do not have to go to school unless they study somewhere else. Students could study without schools and that would be enough. In this way, they do not have to waste time either. I would not like you to get me wrong. There are certainly some advantages to schools existing physically. However, it is not necessary.

I think television could educate people in general. In fact, there are a lot of educational television programmes in many countries. Of course, we would be able to learn many things from books or something else. However, television is able to give us things in action on the screen. For example, we are able to watch various wild animals on such television programmes. Their life, food, shape and so forth. Although it is only on the screen, it is very important that something is moving in reality. Sound is also important, because we can watch various things with the sounds. Although it is not necessarily a television programme that is educational. For instance, there are a number of educational videos on the internet. The thing is, television is a thing which is present in our everyday life. Because it is everywhere in our life. We can watch something we did not know about until we see it. I think that it is really fun. And sometimes, we can discover something educational and interesting on television. This is why I would say that television cannot only entertain us, but can also educate us.

Hi Peter, I’m writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things. But first of all, let me tell you that I hope you and your family are doing well. To begin with, I would like you to know that I don't have a favourite film, but if I were to choose one, I would go for "Beauty and the beast" without doubt whatsoever. With regard to my decision about that specific film, I also wanted you to be informed that I love it because of its message, which is that beauty is found within. Besides, I consider that there is a quite good mix of adventure and fantasy in the film. The plot of the story is about a prince, who was selfish and unkind, and lived in a beautiful castle. One day, an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle, seeking shelter from the bitter storm. Nevertheless, the prince turned the old woman, who was an enchantress, away. Because of that, she transformed him into a hideous beast. The spell would be broken if he could learn to love someone, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal from an enchanted rose fell. Last but not least, I would like to mention that I strongly recommend you to watch it because it is a powerful classic story which never gets old. Let me know your opinion about it. I’m looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

Learning to speak a foreign language today is more important than ever. Speaking a foreign language is important because we can access a lot of information from abroad, we can contact foreign people, and we travel abroad more than in the past. English is the main language we have to study because it dominates the world of work, affairs, and communication. However, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic are important too. Today, the Internet is the main medium where we can find information or we can communicate with other people, and English is the first international language people use on it. Speaking a foreign language improves and increases our knowledge, it connects us with other cultures, it broadens our diversification skills, and so it can reduce conflicts and misunderstandings among people. There are studies that confirm that learning a foreign language keeps the mind young and healthy.

We have only one body and therefore we have to keep it healthy. I think that more important than exercise is a healthy lifestyle. For example, less stress, more vegetables and fruit, and more breaks during work. We would be more alive and have more enthusiasm. The key to a happy life is doing more activities, not only one. I played squash, unfortunately my knee was hurt. Now, I am trying to do a lot of activities. Our mind is half of success. I am going to plan a new lifestyle balance, because it is very important for me. Some fruit and vegetables for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is normal at this time. I do not know anyone who does not eat these things. In the Czech Republic we have tried some spots on TV for a healthy life and I thought it was good for citizens, but many people have not seen them.

The best holiday I have ever been on, was a summer trip to Goplo lake. As far as I remember, it was the summer of 1998. It was just before my 18th birthday, which in Poland marks the age of achieving adulthood, at least in a legal sense. We went to a friend's plot located just by a beautiful lake. He only had a little shed over there, therefore, we had to bring tents and other camping equipment. Some of us had got there by a car and others had ridden on bikes. I remember that my little Fiat was quite a sensation over there. We wrote funny sentences, and decorated it with empty bottles. We used it to drive to the local village to buy some bread and canned meat. We ate cheaply to have more money to spend on alcohol. During the day, we spent most of our time on the lake shore. We were swimming, sun-bathing, playing cards, drinking, and having a lot of fun. The best part of it all was to be there without any worries. When you are a teenager, your only worry is to have something to drink.

There is a lot to say about working. It is the most important thing to do, because it allows you to survive in this world. If we have to work to survive we need to be together. Personally if I had to decide in which way workers should work, I would definitely choose to let them work with their co-workers. Sure, it could be a dangerous move because you are allowing your employees to talk to each other and it is not good at all. On the other hand, you are giving them a nice way to work. Being closed in a cubicle could make an employee feel bad or, in an extreme case, depressed with his job. The size of an office can really make a difference, just image an employee works in a small office. Surely he would feel sad, or feel closed in a cage like an animal, and we know that someone who grows in captivity does not do their job nicely, but if you let people be in touch among them, it could be a good compromise, workers can help each other when they need it. In conclusion, to be a good boss you have to help your team with their job.

In this essay I am going to talk about music in schools and why it is a good subject to study. First of all, music is something that I think everyone should understand. It can give you too many feelings, there are different songs, one for every mood. I have always been jealous of the schools which own music classes. I have really liked music since I was young, it can make you free, happy or make you feel stronger. Of course it could be difficult to understand how to play an instrument, but when you succeed in something you are so proud of yourself. For example after nineteen years I decided to play the guitar, I am at the beginning of this journey so I still have much to learn. It is hard because I am studying it by myself. I think that Italian schools should add music as a subject, because there are so many teenagers that would like to play some instrument, but they cannot. I strongly recommend to add a music class in every school, it will help students to avoid problems related to school, homework and exams. As I said before it can make you free and go away with your mind.

The School of the Future will be totally different from today's. With this era of information and technology, in the future there will be no need to have a place to go to school. The future school will be online, which allows students to attend classes from home. They only need internet access and a laptop. This new school will have a new way where students interact with teachers and have their courses through video conferences. The future school will give a right to students to select their courses and the time they prefer to attend. In the future, school will have no exams. Continuous assessment will be the major how far students understand the course. Learning always needs to be evaluated and the best way to evaluate students is through continuous assessment during class. The future school will allow teachers around the world to teach students overseas. In short, in the future we will have different schools from today's schools.

Hello everyone, nice to meet you. How was your day? Did anything happen to you today? If you would like to share, feel free to contact me. I'm always ready to listen to you. So, let's turn to today's topic. We have a normal subject, but I think it is very close to us. It's about sleep. As you know, some people sleep in a dark and quiet room. Other people sleep with a small light on and don't mind noise. How do you like to sleep? Honestly, I would like to sleep in a dark and quiet room. It makes me comfortable and safe. I also want to sleep alone, because for me, sleep is very important. I can sleep for a long time if nothing bothers me. I don't like anyone or any noise that makes me wake up. I also sleep in the dark, because the light makes me unfocused and easily woken up, suddenly. It's really terrible if you wake up and you don't sleep well again. A good night's sleep will give you a good condition to work and study. So, what about you? Do you sleep in a dark and quiet room or with a light on and noise in the room? Tell me your opinion. Thank you and see you later.

First of all, I think I will be with the first people and also with the second ones. I will tell you why. The first people said that zoos are good to learn about animals and I am with them, but provided the zookeeper doesn't punish animals or treat them like dirt. This also refers to the visitors, they have to respect animals and play with them, but not bother them. Zoos are good for people to see animals in their country, maybe if there weren't zoos children and a whole lot of people couldn't see animals in their whole life. The second people are also right because they are afraid of people doing bad things to animals. Imagine that there were no zoos in your country, how could you see animals in your life? I think you will never see them except in pictures. So it's good for zoos to exist in our world, but without doing anything wrong to the animals.

My best holiday ever was ten years ago when I visited an exhibition about archaeology. This exhibition took place in my city. The visit to the exhibition was important because I could see evidence that dinosaurs had been living near my house thousands of years ago. I could see a couple of archaeological sites with many digs and in one of these digs there were a few bones from dinos. These bones can be called fossils and it is important to describe how the dinos became extinct or what their nutrition base was, or even if these animals had some disease. This holiday was important to me because I could spend time with friends and relatives that I hadn't seen in a long time. They were living in another state far away from here, but they came to visit the exhibition. So, in summary, that day was great, my friends, relatives and I had an excellent and fun day.

What can be more important than exercise? One needs energy to be able to run, jump, or do yoga. Therefore, there are at least two more valuable components to our health: food and sleep. In 2017 the Noble prize in medicine was granted to a team led by professor Rosbach for their research on circadian rhythm. Their discoveries focus on the sleep-wake cycle which is implanted in our cells. The research denotes that our bodies function better when we adhere to these patterns. Furthermore, it revealed that each and every organ of our body functions according to a slightly different pattern. Therefore, it's not only important that we go to bed at a certain time, but also that we eat at a certain time. Generally speaking, people who sleep well tend to be more relaxed and less spiteful. By the same token, a sufficient amount of sleep precludes an immoderate need for coffee. Then there is the exercise; the third component of circadian rhythm. To be healthy means to feel tired in the evening and refreshed in the morning. Therefore, we should exercise at least 30 minutes a day to avert the effects of our sedentary life style.

For many years, television has been used for entertainment. Now television is used as more than only a tool of entertainment. Television entertains, but it can also educate. Schools are now using television as part of the tools to help teachers in their education process. In addition to that there are many channels helping students at home to gain knowledge and learn. Children at home can play and learn at the same time from channels dedicated to and suitable for their age. Television has been helpful for many sectors, like health, civil defence, and others to rise and create orientation to the people. Television shows what is going on around the world and enriches our knowledge and makes us discover other cultures. Television is educating people about the weather in order to help them decide when they should travel, go fishing, and other things they might do. Television is always educating all the people all the time.

Hello everyone, I have the opportunity to write about the schools of the future. It is a complex topic because it has many viewpoints. Well, it is time to give my opinion. Let's begin. 1. It is necessary to keep in mind that I am from Colombia, a totally underdeveloped country. Sadly it is a country with many economic problems, where most people are poor or extremely poor. Children face a lot of difficulties to go to school, while the other part of the population cannot go to school and a minority can go to school without any issue. 2. The pandemic has been the reason for a change. Now, children take their classes in their house. They use the virtual way to study, but you should think if they are poor many do not have a computer, WiFi, a desk or items to study. The government of Colombia wants to implement virtual classes, but the question is what is going to happen to the children? In conclusion, I think the schools should keep their essence; they are places to study, share, learn, teach, play. But it is possible in the future these places will give us some virtual classes and relationships with schools from other countries, improving our vision of the world. But, if this improvement requires more money, the children of Colombia cannot go to school, worsening their possibilities of bettering their life and their economic conditions. Colombia needs a total change where the resources will be invested in the population, in business, education, roads, farming, etcetera.

Phuc Tan Phu District Nguyen Son Street Las Noches City March 3rd, 2021 Dear Town Council, My name is Phuc. I heard that you are thinking about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Allow me to demonstrate my viewpoint about this. First of all, I don't think this is a good idea. The ban on mobile phone use can be disapproved of by many citizens, who find it very convenient and essential in their daily life. Mobile phones make it easier to communicate, find information, to contact with people. Basically, they are essential tools in a vast and dynamic society these days. The prohibition on using them shouldn't be implemented. This can result in many problems. On the contrary, there is a serious problem when people freely use mobile phones: noise. There is a variety of complaints about this problem. Many people use their mobile phones at a high volume in public. However, as I mentioned before, the banning on mobile phone use can result in many problems. So, to prohibit this issue, instead of banning them from using mobile phones, the town authorities should impose some laws and and rules. This may reduce the amount of noise in public and won't cause much discomfort for surrounding people. In conclusion, banning mobile phone use in public is not a good idea. Instead, it can be controlled by imposing some laws and rules. Sincerely, Phuc

Yes, these are very good questions. I think animals belong in nature. It does not matter whether this nature is in the forest or another place in town. A lot of kinds of animals live in their hometown or area. Zoos are places where they take care of them, for example, very kindly, politely, or mother carefully. I have very often been to zoos in Prague, where I live, but now I do not have enough spare time for it. Many kinds of animals are only in zoos. They are not in nature areas. It is very important for future generations. I hope animals are satisfied there. I have supported them and I will support them again. Therefore I can´t agree with the opinions that animals in zoos are like in prison. Everyone likes animals and animals give us many reasons to support them. It is a nice place in town. I can invite you to Prague´s zoo.

What do I do in my free time? Firstly, I don't have a lot of free time, I am very busy. Secondly, I like to do very many things. So, when I have a little free time, I need to choose what I will do. What can I do during this time ? I like reading a historical book, walking in the countryside, talking with my friends, watching a good soap opera, working out with my mother or doing nothing. My problem is to choose. So, I prefer being busy because I don't have any choice to make.

Hi John! How are you! I hope this email finds you well and sound. Last week, I went to a music concert held in the magnificent music hall of Suzhou. I had been expecting this concert for a long time, and I even booked a ticket three months in advance. The primary reason I choose this particular concert is because Lang Lang, an internationally renowned pianist, would perform in the concert. I got to know Lang Lang when I was just six. You probably know that I have been playing the piano for 10 years, and the key motive for my persistence is because of Lang Lang, my spiritual tutor. The concert was very well organized. Lang Lang played at least 10 masterpieces of music on the stage. You can't imagine how the whole audience stood up and applauded for Lang Lang after each piano piece. Nobody went out for a break during the concert. Lang Lang was so polite that he went back on stage for three times after the final piece, and he played two more pieces to show his gratitude. I had a wonderful night that day, and my interest in piano has been sparkled once more; therefore, I cannot help writing to you, and I wish to share my happiness and excitement with you. Best wishes, Michael

Hello everyone, Today, I have the opportunity to write about my opinion on whether television can educate. Now, it is time to write, let's begin. Television is an extremely useful or harmful device. It depends on the person who is using it, because if the person is disciplined, is interested in knowledge, and watching educational programs, they can take advantage of cultural programs. These actions permit people to be educated. Otherwise, if a person is not disciplined, is not interested in knowledge, is watching movies, series, novels, comedies, and other entertainment programs, it means they do not take advantage of their time. This person will not be educated. I think, television is as useful or as harmful as the Internet. Clever people learn languages, do courses, download programs and exchange knowledge with other people of other cultures and other countries. While foolish people misspend their time only looking at jokes, memes, and spam. They do not want to learn anything, their interest is in nothing but upsetting the world. There are many lazy people that do not take advantage of useful things. It is the difference with people that exert themselves and are successful. I think I am a clever person, because I try to take advantage of my resources, such as television, internet, books, and information. For example, I try to learn English using Cambridge For You. It is on the Internet. I listen to English with movies, series, and programs. I like to watch crime programmes.

As I see it, it is more important these days than in the past, owing to the fact that today we have a more globalized world where you can fly and do tourism or live anywhere. And besides, we're connected throughout the world by internet, therefore, each day we can speak with people from other countries and learn from them. Right now, the most international language is English, hence I believe in the present moment it is very important to learn it. Nevertheless, it is true that in the past it was harder to acquire a new language due to the lack of options people had to study. For instance, they didn't have all the apps, courses, language schools, and so on that we currently have. To summarize, from my point of view today it's more important for the reason that we are living in a more globalized world where we can speak with people from other countries each day. Although learning a new language has always been very useful and interesting and I recommend everyone to do it.

It is true that we're all taught to always tell the truth. But, in fact, sometimes we do not follow that lesson. We do the opposite but the interesting thing is it's somehow accepted. So, did our teachers teach us wrongly? No, they didn't. Being honest is important. That's not erroneous at all. But, in some circumstances, a lie is more preferred. First of all, telling a lie can sometimes motivate the people we care to excel. Humans are very competitive and always want to be the best at every task they have been assigned. Whether they are taking part in an athletic event or taking an examination, they feel more motivated if they think it is possible to achieve the best result. You may know the fact that it's an unthinkable thing for some of them. Nevertheless, instead of telling the truth and completely destroying their hope, being a liar in those cases is better. Secondly, being honest at all time may lead you to high level of anxiety. Not all truths are good to be revealed. Some of them can make people unpleasant. For example, last week, my friend asked me what I thought about her new hairstyle. Well, I said frankly it looked terrible. Although she didn't express any anger indication, I knew she was very upset inside. She hasn't talked to me since that day. Therefore, be careful what you are going to say. In a nutshell, telling the truth is crucial. Well, no doubt about it. But, sometimes, you should do the opposite. If not, you may regret what you said.

Since the dawn of times, man has travelled from place to place at the expense of the most precious and irretrievable currency: time. Now we can travel at speeds that were beyond the imagination of commuters just a hundred years ago. I don't want to sound disparaging of inventions like the Hyperloop, but it seems like we are touching the limits. Therefore, the future of travel will be more about comfort and safety. Even now, when I'm writing this article, some long-distance planes are equipped with the latest comforts and luxuries. You can travel across the Atlantic in your very own cabin which is like a room at a five star hotel. When you arrive, you will be rested. Almost like the struggle of the trip has never happened. I believe that sooner or later we will be flying in a mini version of a town, where you not only can have a meal, but also visit a hairdresser or a doctor.

Write and Improve is a very useful tool to learn English. For me writing is an important skill, because when writing we are forced to use our mind thinking in English. To make up a text also needs creativity. So I have two sessions of writing in my weekly routine. Write and Improve has more levels of difficulty. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced or Business and there is a section Just for fun. Other parts are related to the IELTS and B2 exam, but I don't know this part. After having selected your level, you can select one of many exercises. The text tells you how many words you have to write. After having finished your exercise, you can check your text. I think this is a very helpful tool. Above all for people like me that are studying on their own and don't have a check. It's more difficult to improve without someone that tells you if you write wrong or right. I think that this tool works very well, but it's always a robot. Maybe sometimes you write correctly, but not in real English. I don't know if there are some more pertinent phrases. Of course I recommend this tool to everyone, because it's well done and especially for people alone or without control.

Exercise is very important to us otherwise for health, power, and activity. We have a lot of stress, depression, dissatisfaction, and madness in our life, and doing exercise is the best solution for all of these problems. All of those things are going to make you think of killing yourself, unless you go to the gym or just do some exercise at home that will be good for you and your negative power. Yes, there are things that are as important as exercise, like food. Whenever you want to start a diet or create some habit in your life, the most important thing you have to think about is to reschedule your food list. You have to avoid eating fast food or food that has a lot of calories, like ice cream, chocolate, chips, etc. This food is going to kill you slowly and make you gain weight, which will make you feel depressed or angry. So the thing we all should do is exercise, even four times a week. The second thing is to have a food list and avoid unhealthy food. Perform these things not for a week or a month but your whole life. Remember doing a habit, not a period.

I think it is true that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Because you cannot take any money to heaven. It could be a waste if you died when you had a lot of money in your hand. But you will not have to worry about your money if you are healthy. Since you are healthy, you can do anything to earn money. You could even gain more knowledge in your life if you were able to live longer. I think that knowledge is the most important thing in our life. This is why I think that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. What is more, there are a lot of things to do, which cannot be bought by money. The thing which is the most important to you is in your mind. I am sure that you also have something that cannot be bought by money. It could be family, friends, and so on. We have to take care of our health to become happier. Although it takes some money to buy healthy food, we can do it, definitely.

Hi John, How are you doing? I hope you and your family are doing well. I'm writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things. To begin with, I would like to mention that last week I went to an extraordinary concert by Lady Gaga. As you know, pop music is not my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I decided to go with my bestie, Mike, due to the fact that he had one ticket available for that concert. His sister was supposed to use it, but she couldn't make it as she was quite ill. Much to my surprise the concert turned out to be a magnificent spectacle. I realized it from the very moment Lady Gaga started to sing. Her performance was flawless and emotional. Besides, a superb group of dancers were contributing to making it even better in the meantime. It was simply amazing! Needless to say, I had a great time with Mike and not only did I hang out with him, but also his cousin, Peter, accompanied me. Refreshments were on me and we danced and sang like never before. Long story short, it was a breathtaking event, and I hope you will be able to join us next time we have a plan. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

Exercise is important for our health and there are other things that are also important. The core question is how to balance all the things in our lives. First of all, exercising is a healthy and cheap way to keep both body and mind healthy. However, exercising excessively can hinder our other activities. Some people are addicted to exercise, I would say these people are living in the gym. Second, as I said at the beginning of this text, we need to keep a balance in our lives. Not exercising is as bad as exercising exaggeratedly. Most people know they need to do some kind of exercise for a specific amount of time during the week. If we do not exercise, we can become sadder or we can develop diseases or conditions, such as obesity and muscle problems, or we can feel pain in the body. Therefore, exercise is just as important as other activities.

I don't think forcing students and school children to do sports activities is a smart answer to the problems encountered. Indeed, if students are forced to do sport, they may connect the activity to a negative emotion. They would have no choice in the short term, but in the long run it would not be a strategy that benefits them-because, I have met many students who were compelled to do something every day when they were at school . It could be writing, reading, or doing sports in our case. Most of them, stopped after they finished school or university, because they didn't enjoy these activities. Going to the gym, or on the field was not something they always appreciated. So, it may help us to feel better because we force them to do something, for their own well being. But, it raises a question. What about what students want, and how they feel about it ? Actually studies are showing that moderate physical activity is enough to stay healthy. It includes: walking up the stairs, brisk walking, dancing, gardening etc... Also we know, that one of the main causes of the sedentary lifestyle is the interest that young people have in video games. Some schools experimented with projects related to these games, and the scope of the activity leads students to walk, run, or jump to find hidden objects for example. The young people didn't feel like they were forced to do sports, because they were taking part to an activity that was fun, relevant, and meaningful to them. My statement is that teachers, could include similar activities to their courses, instead of struggling with students who do not want to do sports, for example. It might be a first step to engage children or students, then they may find themselves interested in a sport in particular. However, as long as they have a physical activity on a daily basis, sport should not be an obligation.

Television is not only entertaining, but also educational. Nowadays, in the era of science and technology, television is making quite an impact on people. As plenty of people watch TV every day, and their mind or thinking may change because of television. My viewpoints are as follows, First, television is a good medium for people to learn languages. For example, if people want to learn English, they can watch English TV programs or movies. In these TV programs, people can learn the usage of vocabulary, the tone of speaking, and so on. Moreover, people can get news and knowledge through television. There are a lot of programs that are educational, such as on Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel. Television provides many choices for people. We can choose the purpose we need, i. e. entertainment or education. To make the best use of television, and let television have the biggest effect on us.

The reason is very easy, it is the economic business. In many rural areas there are so many problems from a health system point of view. It's obvious, if a city is rich, there are quite all the opportunities to buy such new and performative medical equipment and this also for the most important doctors. In rural areas, the health problem is one of the real problems, but not the only one. I don't know if there is a solution to this problem, maybe the only solutions can be that the doctors must make a choice from a medical point of view, so to try to save as many lives as possible rather than choose their economic business. Maybe another solution can be government help to improve the situation in rural areas, and give the opportunity for all the population to have equal medial treatment and guarantee a healthy life for everyone, because it is a right and a must.

Obviously the second one. Open design offices are the most effective type of arrangements, from a visual point of view but also from a work point of view. If there aren't walls that separate employees, I think employees can work better and more quickly, because there is cooperation between employees. There are also disadvantages to no-wall offices, there isn't privacy and if you have to focus on a task there can be a lot of noise that can be not giving you good concentration to do that. The types of arrangements of offices, however, must be chosen for the aim of the office, for example if the office is in a bank the better type of arrangement is a closed office to preserve the privacy of the customers, but if the office, for example, is a social media office, the type of arrangement can be a no-wall office. In the end the no-wall offices are better but for the right employment sectors.

I think that for students it is better to have more teachers or tutors. Each of them has another style of teaching. For example, one of them gives priority to speaking skills and another one wants only grammar. In 2018, I had a great English teacher who gave me a lot of skills. I wanted all the best for me, therefore, we practised a lot of grammar, reading, speaking, and writing. While speaking it is very important to know many words or vocabularies. Without them it is not possible. It was very important for me know that. To improve listening skills it is very important to listen to the radio and podcasts. Every English teachers wants to teach students how they can do this. I only want to say that I need to improve my English skills so I wish for more teachers. It is better for me than fewer. I may see results in the future. I hope it is true.

It is the best type of requirement. Volunteer work is important to improve human ability, to become better. Nowadays young people don't give the right importance to volunteer work, because for them it's boring and doesn't give them a salary. In our days, working is the means to get money, hence volunteer work isn't real work for quite all younger people. It is true, volunteer work doesn't give a salary in exchange, but I think it gives a more important thing than the money: the opportunity to help others, to become a man. It's a job for the aim and I completely agree with the requirement of some high schools to involve students in doing volunteer work in order to graduate. It's better for others but also for the students, because it is maybe the first work in their life. In the end, I hope that in the future more and more schools give the opportunity to their students to do volunteer work in order to graduate. It is the best requirement that a school can do for their students.

Zoos represent a new kind of entertainment for all people, from children to adults. Their number is increasing more and more every day. This is the reason why non-profit organizations like Greenpeace do not agree with that phenomenon. In fact, they believe animals must belong in nature, and zoos seem to be prisons rather than peaceful and enjoyable places. In my opinion, there is no point in putting wild animals chained into zoos; they must be free, as we are. There are many ways and alternative solutions to see them. For example, safaris and other tours do not require any restrictions for animals. You can go with a guide and visit these stunning natural parks, admiring the beauty of local wildlife. I know that the staff of every zoo treats animals well. Moreover, all wrong behaviour and bad treatment is not allowed. Laws are clear and it is a worth. Even though animals are confined in zoos, they are safe and well treated. Anyway, from my point of view I would prefer to see all animals free in their habitat and, in general, in wild nature, in their right place!

Exercise and practice are very important to improve our skills. They are quite relevant to keep always fit. However, it seems that all the other things are becoming less important than them. In my opinion, taking care of our health is important, but it is not the only thing: several things colour our life. There is no point in getting our body more and more stressed by doing exercises for many hours. In fact, some researchers state that it is sufficient to work out from 30 to 45 minutes. An excessive session might lead to sudden problems. Obviously, we want to avoid them. Not only is physical exercise important, but also mental exercise. Our brain is essential for the whole human body as well as our heart. For example, reading books or doing creative activities such as painting or drawing, are very helpful. The latest studies have confirmed how powerful these activities are. What's more, they can be done in our leisure time. During the week it could be a good idea to alternate them with physical training.

The flowers and the sun, they are different in this season. In this season animals are more active and the green in plants is more intense.

Are you one of those who can't live without traveling? If your answer is yes then this article is for you! For many years we have been travelling a lot, however, with the lockdowns for the CO-VID 19 now we can't travel like in the past. We will have to travel differently from now on, for example, some countries have suggested creating a digital passport so that everyone knows who has been vaccinated. Also, I think that travelling will be more expensive from now on, for the reason that many airlines have lost too much money and only the strongest companies will survive. Therefore we will have fewer offers of airplanes and hence the prices could be higher. For this reason, I believe that local tourism will gain importance from now on. Have you ever thought about how many wonderful places your country has? However, I hope this current situation has a happy ending and we can travel again like we used to do.

Nowadays, it is well known that exercise is very important for our mental and physical health. Firstly, it is undeniable that doing exercise consistently can help us boost our mood, release our stress, and more. As a result, the majority of the population practises at least one sport on a daily basis. Nevertheless, in my opinion we should take care and not overwhelm ourselves with too much exercise. I have seen people who are always injured owing to the fact that they are playing sports for a long time and they never take a rest. In conclusion, in my opinion I believe we should practise exercise because it has a lot of benefits for us, however, we also have to be aware that there are more important things we should do in order to have a well-balanced life. For instance, one important thing which I suggest is to do meditation, for the reason that it is a great way to relax our body and mind.

Schools have been involved in many evolutions for the last few decades. They are changing still now, because of the pandemic emergency. New tools and a new approach are tested in order to cope with this hard period. Are they effective? Are they not? What might schools be in the future, after the end of the emergency? These are hard questions to be answered, but we will try to do it in this article. All of us have had to stay indoors, changing our routine deeply. Students get used to attempting online lectures, from primary school to university. The goal consists of continuing teaching as best as possible. However, many problems occur in this way. For example, children and teenagers do not receive the same quality of feedback as in live lessons: as a result, they cannot learn new topics well and their preparation level gets lower and lower. On the other hand, most university students are doing this kind of activities with good results. Therefore, it seems that universities are going to keep this approach even when the emergency finishes. Will it be so?

I have read a lot of articles about London and I have bought a few book about it. Now it is not great time to travel abroad because the corona virus crisis in the world has closed everything surrounding us. I might go to London next time. Therefore, there are many advantages abroad for students and I can recommend going there. I am expecting a lot of new experiences.

I'm just starting in a new school and I'm so excited about that, because I will have new classmates, teachers, and new rules to know. This is a new era for me. New school subjects will be added in my book to follow and learn this year, like math, biology, history and geography, and I'd never had these subjects in my old school and I'm so excited to learn. In my old school, I had so much difficulty with philosophy, chemistry and sociology, but I had a good teacher and he helped me with these areas. My goals this year in school are to study a lot every single day, and the weekend too, because probably these new subjects will be harder and my mom probably wants to hire a tutor to help me. I'm so pleased with the subjects of PE and English, these are the only subjects where I understand everything.

Well, it depends on how that work is are led because if it is imposed, the development of important skills and perceptions can be jeopardized then the learning process will be consequently affected. Let me explain, when a young person is forced to do something they do not want to do, they normally do it in a sloppy way which means that the tasks or job will be jeopardized on both sides, the worker and the work. The worker will not absorb the learning from that task or job and the work will be not so good. On the other hand, when you force a young person to do something when they are not encouraged to anything, this can help them to discover new things and to learn during the process.

I would like to say that learning to speak a foreign language is more important these days than it was in the past. More and more, people around the world live in this global world. We may meet more and more foreigners in our daily life than we could in the past. We should be able to speak another language, especially English, so that we can talk with people from around the world. It is a very important thing that, being able to speak with people from other countries. Communication is always important in general. Some people would say that we do not have to speak in other languages because we could communicate with translation software. However, I would say that it is not real communication. We should speak to people directly at any time so that we could communicate our emotions to them as well. Moreover, we could not expect other people to use translation software at any time. This is why I insist in my opinion that we have to learn foreign languages. Hopefully, it is not only English, but also another language, too.

Trying to live on own while you are a university student is quite difficult. Surely it is a good opportunity to become an adult, to improve your skill inside the house but from an economic point of view quite all students don't have such a money base to survive on their own. It is different if you study abroad, like Erasmus students that must study in a country far from family and friends and do housework in their free time. If you have a chance to live on your own I suggest taking this chance. At first it can be really difficult but day by day you become an adult and your pains will be transformed into joys. I think that living on our own is the dream of every teenager, especially after a fight with parents, but living on your own is not easy, there is a lot of freedom but a lot of responsibility that a young person must regard.

Learning English Is it important to learn English? The English language is a common language all over the world and it is the first language. It is an easy language to learn. There are two countries speaking English, the USA and the UK. The English language is very important for several reasons. It is a world language, like for companies. Moreover, to accept you in college you have to be good at English. Also, it is necessary when you want to complete your studies somewhere else. In addition, if you travel to another country you have to talk with them in English. There are many ways to acquire the language. Some people travel to a city in which there are people whose native tongue is English, but other join local English classes. There is a modern way to learn English by taking online classes. In conclusion, in my opinion, the English language is very important. For me the best way to learn English is to travel to an English-speaking country because you can practise.

Travelling in future will be very different from now. We will travel via data streaming or through high-speed bridges. Now we do not know anything about the future because the worldu00B4s visionaries are not coming. In my opinion, now the best visionary is Elon Musk and his new project X Space. This will be one kind of travelling. Many of us can believe that our lives will be better, I do not think so. Each of us is sitting with computers at the table and health goes out of the window. Therefore, I think there will have to be new opportunities, for example, working on a high-speed train, on self-driving cars, etc. Yes, I am looking forward to our future of travelling. In the Czech republic we might have a new project about crossing point of Europe. I do not know more about that. It is a secret plan of our officials at the top. That is my point of view.

Television has a short history, it was invented in the 20th century by an Englishman. I actually do not know his purpose. Why did he invent such a device? This is not important for the vast majority of society anymore, I guess. No one questions why or when anymore, we just enjoy what was invented. We did not ask even if it was harmful, beneficial, or anything else. Firstly, I think television is far from educational. It is a distraction for children and maybe young adults. We can't deny that there are a few educational channels, but how many of us really get away from the TV series and watch them? The answer as it distinctly stands here, almost none of us. Older ladies love soap operas, young adults love shows like GOT or The Bing Bang Theory, and kids mostly watch cartoons. Maybe cartoons are of little use for kids, but their parents should choose them carefully. They can contain violence, sexuality, or rudeness. Secondly, besides what I wrote in the first paragraph, there are also benefits. There are news, documentaries, and economy channels, but I still insist that most of us do not watch those channels or programs. While most people do not like to watch documentaries, since computers and phones have become common, nobody uses television for news and stock markets. Phones are more preferred in this regard because they are a lot more practical. But people who do not know how to use a phone or computer or do not have them still use television for this purpose. As a result, in my opinion, television is not a necessity in our age and it does more harm than good. I think it is far from being educational. We cannot ignore the benefits only during the pandemic period. Children who do not have access to computers and phones in our country attended their classes on television. Other than that, I don't think it has any benefit for education.

The future of travel. I believe the way that we travel is about to change. We can analyze this in two different ways. First, for the short term and second for the long term. In the short term tourists will visit their own countries more. They will explore places in rural areas more. I believe that this will happen because of restrictions on travelling abroad imposed by the governments, due to the health situation after the COVID pandemic, and another reason is the costs and expenses of a trip. In the first months after the pandemic will have been controlled, the dollar exchange rate will still be high. But in the long term, trips will seem like now again. A massive quantity of people will move to resorts and other touristic places. But if we think of the farther future, maybe in the next 5 or 10 years, I think people will be able to visit space and the moon. Who knows?

Sleeping is one of the most indispensable activities in human life. We spend almost one third of our life sleeping. Having enough sleep gives us many benefits in terms of both physical and mental health. Clearly, the way we sleep really matters. While many people prefer a dark and quiet room, others are able to sleep in a noisy atmosphere and with high brightness. I belong to the first group because I believe it will be easier to fall asleep in a quiet environment with a low light. Furthermore, due to the importance of sleep, we need to make sure that we are not affected by any factors like noise and light. Sleeping in this safe environment could result in better health, which enhances our quality of life.

Nowadays, people can read books on their computers or tablets, or even on their smartphones. Then, students in general could use those devices to study in schools or universities. The thing is, should these devices replace books in those situations? In my opinion, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Because they are simply convenient. Books take so much space. Books are also damaged as time goes by. On the other hand, computers and tablets do not take so much space. Also, they can contain a lot of books. More importantly, students do not need to carry such heavy textbooks. There would be less trouble if they did not have to bring their textbooks all the time. Of course, computers and tablets need electricity whereas books do not need it. However, the advantages of computers and tablets outweigh the disadvantages. On balance, basically, schools and universities should use computers and tablets to get the students to study. If there are problems with them, then they should use books in those cases. It is inevitable that new technology replaces tradition.

First of all we have to know that English is the most, first in the world. The reasons why I'm learning English. Me, I always love to learn new things, learn about new cultures, and make a friendship, so nowadays if you need to know, learn, or dig deep in the world you have to learn English to do all of that. I like to listen to music from the whole world for which I also need English. All the reasons I have mentioned back to my view and myself. everybody wants to work in international companies or work abroad, or even in your native country all of these things require English. Languages are the way in which every single person connects, so you have to learn at least English. Then, if you have time to learn another is the things that never die or you never regret spending your time on it.

In my opinion, studying music can be very interesting for students, especially for young students. However, for older students it should be optional. For younger students music classes would be very nice for their brain development and to increase their cognitive abilities. Music can be very interesting to get a better relationship among the students too, especially if the students can create a band, for instance. At all ages music is good, but it is better for children. Music can be a way they become more calm and concentrate too. For teenage students, it can be optional, because these students have a lot of disciplines, they need to practise many sports too, they must prepare for the university too. But, for teenagers also, music can be important. They can improve many potential skills, like concentration, because in this stage of life it is common to be agitated and music can help.

It depends on the opportunity, it depends on the financial conditions, it depends what the students desire. The student needs to think about many things. First of all, what do you want? What is most important? If you don't want to spend a lot of money, you should study close to your parents' house, continue to live there and you will save a lot of money. But if the student has a lot of money, and he wants to study in the best university, he shouldn't give importance to living with his parents and go though the world searching to study anywhere. When you go to decide how you will make the university you need to consider many factors, for example, in your future career is it necessary to have a high credibility graduate? Is it necessary to spend a lot of money? Or if you can, or should, continue your studies after graduation.

I always sleep with a small light which I put by the bed. There are 2 reasons for this. First, I'm scared to sleep in the dark and I can't sleep well.

Are you one of those who have wondered about what the schools of the future will be like? If your answer is yes, this article is for you. It is true that schools haven't changed a lot these last few years. Nevertheless, with the arrival of the pandemic they have been forced to adapt. Nowadays, there are a lot of virtual classrooms and in the future I believe there will be even more of them. As a result, some students are happy owing to the fact that they don't have to spend time going to school. Besides they can attend their lessons from a comfortable sofa. However, we don't have only advantages with these modifications. Since for the students the contact with their classmates is highly important. In conclusion, I believe that in the future the schools will change and probably digital schools will gain a big presence in our society, even though the schools we know won't disappear for the reason that we're humans and we need contact with each other.

In the world of today, technology takes a lot of our time, even when we are studying something. Books have been a great resource for students and for humans since the birth of writing, but these days, they are replaced by technology, such as tablets and computers, and online sites such as Wikipedia. I think that technology is great in school and my opinion is that it should completely replace books in schools and universities. You can find the same materials that you find in a book on computers because there are a lot of sites where you can find information about something, or even digital books that you can buy online . Technology in school is better because it is more efficient and quicker than books, and this can be great for a student that has not much time to study.

As I see it, I subscribe to the viewpoint that learning to play a musical instrument is an important thing for all students. Firstly, owing to the fact that there is a lot of research where they have discovered that the students who learned how to play an instrument have better abilities in learning to acquire a new language. In addition, playing an instrument could help to improve the coordination among our senses. For instance, in order to play the piano well you must have good coordination between your sense of hearing and your sense of touch. Secondly, due to the fact that playing an instrument is an enjoyable way to help students to relieve them of their stress that they might have for the exams, tasks and so on. In conclusion, I support the study of music in school for our children, for the reason that in my opinion it is a useful class with a lot of benefits.

I agree with this statement. Money is important in our life. We need money to live. We could have a minimal life, but we need money for food, for paying the rent, for buying some clothes. There are some things necessary to live. I mean to be rich with a high level of wealth. Everybody would like to earn a very high income. But if we have a good income and we can't enjoy it, because we aren't healthy. So I think that health is very important to enjoy life. Our life is very short and we have to focus not only on the money, but on the small things. It is not a minimal way of life. I mean not that minimal. We can choose our perfect fit. If to be rich we have to struggle tons of hours every day and then we haven't time to enjoy it, I think that isn't a good idea. We can set up what we need to live and be healthy to enjoy it.

Hey, How have you been? Last week, I went to a concert with a friend. It was of The Rose. They are a Korean band. We had regular tickets. When we were waiting to enter, it started to rain and I was really cold. When we finally entered the hall after three and a half hours of waiting, we stood in the middle of the hall, a little to the front. They came on and everyone started to scream. It was a really good concert and I was having the best time of my life. Unfortunately, something had to go wrong. I fainted two times. The first time I stood right back up because I didn't want to miss the rest of the concert. After 20 minutes I fainted again. But this time I don't remember what happened. All I know is when I opened my eyes, a light was shining on me so that security could find me and I was taken outside.

I studied English at school. I think I have a good structure, but after school I didn't practise this language. So I forgot it. I work in a travel agency, but we work only with French groups, so I have learnt French at work. But I have the English language in my heart. So I have begun to study English on my own. I think it's important for my culture. My favourites writers, singers, and authors are American and English. It's a part of my culture. On the other hand, I can access very interesting resources. There are a lot of articles, blogs, journals, and books that could feed my knowledge. Of course, it's important even for my work. This new language is a skill that in the near future can give me also a new opportunity. In closing, if I attain fluency in English I could meet new people. I live in a touristic village, so there are so many occasions to meet new people from the whole world.

When I was younger, my group of friends started a short non - government organization in my city that is called "Social hug.." As I live in Brazil and the Brazilian schools don't require their students to do a certain amount of volunteer work, I did all the work in this ONG because I wanted to. Years later - or nowadays - I can see how important it was to build this project and work on it. I got to know a lot of people who are my close friends until today and the best part of this is what made our friendship happen: the wish to care for each other. Certainly, every volunteer work that a person can do will shake a lot of inner feelings out and make him think about society's problems, asking himself questions such as, "Where do I fit in this society? Why do those people need my help? What is the impact of my actions?" At the end of the experience, I'm sure that everyone will become a better human being.

Health is a thing that is much discussed. I think that when we talk about health we can't make a list of important things because health is not only one thing but is a mix of things that strongly affect our body. I think that there are a lot of things that are important for our health, like diet, and exercise, and water. Exercise is fundamental because it helps us to reduce stress, and also helps our body's health. Diet is important when we talk about health, it is a primary thing for our body. And if you have a bad diet surely you also have bad health because you don't feed your body correctly and you don't give it the right nutrients . In my opinion, to have a healthy life you have to improve these things because surely your life will go a lot better.

Nowadays, it is a fact that we spend too much time watching TV. Therefore, we must know that the programs we choose to watch can make a huge impact on a daily basis and influence us. It is a fact that most people would rather watch TV shows without any meaning than documentaries where they can learn new interesting things, for the reason that TV shows can be more pleasant. However, if you are a person who wants to learn new things you can find plenty of channels where they broadcast useful programs. In addition, if you want to acquire a new language you have the option of changing the language and adding subtitles to your favourite films or TV series that you usually watch. In conclusion, I believe that television is mostly used to amuse people, though if you want to educate yourself while watching TV you have the option to do it.

After graduating from high school students have to make tough decisions. Maybe the toughest one is to choose a university. Is it better to stay in your hometown or maybe to move away? Young people face a lot of challenges. One of them might be adapting to a new environment. If a student chooses to stay in his hometown he will have the support of his family. Not only mental support is necessary. Living in big city, where the best universities are located, is usually expensive. The cost of renting an apartment has risen significantly during the last decade. Moreover, the cost of public transport should also be considered. Staying with parents is a much more cost-saving option. It allows students to make substantial savings, that will be crucial in their future lives. Whereas staying at home has a lot of advantages, it is not an ideal option. Moving to another city might be very developing for high school graduates. It allows students to make new friendships. It is also a space to test responsibility. Some people call it "the school of life." I agree that it is a test of maturity and some young people need it. Another thing is that people in their twenties desire independence. Moving away to study is a great way to achieve it. To sum up, in my opinion, going to another city to study is a better option than staying at home. However, I recommend visiting parents regularly.

I think that learning a new language in this moment of history is more important than in the past. Learning languages is really important for us for many reasons. Speaking a foreign language can help us in many ways and in different situations. For example, if I know Spanish I can travel and speak with other people in a great number of countries, like Brazil, Spain, Perù and Mexico. Speaking one or more foreign languages can help you also at work because a great number of companies search for people who speak many languages because it is important for commerce.

There is no doubt these days, so Many people have been speaking different languages besides their mother language for centuries. The question is, is it necessary to have knowledge about other languages as it was before? In this essay I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of the positive side, some studies say it is necessary to speak important languages, especially English and Spanish. The main reason given to support this claim is that eighty percent of scientific language is written in English and 20% in other languages.,. If you wish to be professional in your speciality you have to be fluent in English. most of the universities around the world are teaching in English. On the other hand some people are against this opinion and strongly believe that learning any foreign language has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, while learning any language you will get its culture as a part of your study and this knowledge would effect your beliefs and thought about your own faith. Secondly, a lot of books and information have been translated to a national language. Finally, Google Translate could help anyone to translate any document from any language to any other language for free. In conclusion, I believe that it is really important to learn English as it is the most famous of foreign languages, which is mandatory to complete a higher educational degree.

My reasons for learning English: Being able to speak a foreign language can be very advantageous. There are plenty of reasons for learning a new language and find one's passion. In this essay, I will focus on the English language and explain my reasons for learning it. First of all, when being able to speak English there are almost no boundaries of communication. Since English is an international language or 'lingua franca' the majority of the world's population has knowledge of English. Thus, one can have conversations with people all over the world. Moreover, the English language, especially the British accent is very charming to my taste. I adore listening to it and therefore would love to speak that way. Furthermore, I love to listen to modern music. The fact that nearly every song is in English incites me to learn English even more. Accordingly, I am able to understand all lyrics.

We live in a capitalist society, a massive number of doctors prefer to prioritise money instead of thinking of creating a better society. Of course, a doctor who has studied for almost ten years to obtain his diploma must earn a reasonable salary to compensate for the time invested in his profession. But, in my opinion, a doctor should have the desire to treat people despite their social conditions. Doctors prefer to work in cities instead of rural areas especially because of the money and because it provides better conditions to exercise his work. I have visited a city where the hospitals had collapsed because of an outbreak, without conditions to help people because there wasn't any medicine and not even equipment to protect themselves. Based on my knowledge, there are ways to solve these problems. The authorities should invest more money in infrastructure in rural areas and pay extra money as an incentive to doctors who work in rural areas, in my country the federal government hired immigrants from Cuba to work in rural areas.

As you all know, sleeping is really important for our health. Therefore, I would like to talk to all of you about how I usually like to sleep. I strongly believe that to sleep in the dark is better than sleeping with a small light on. However, when I was a kid I used to sleep with a small light on. Nowadays, I prefer to sleep in a dark and in a quiet room, because silence is very necessary to sleep and rest well.

I prefer to sleep in quite a dark room, for many reasons people usually prefer this. One of these reasons is that its scientifically proven that its healthier. And I don't know how to justify my answer as it's just how am I. People who don't mind noise are lucky but they should be careful though, this can affect the quality of sleep they get and can affect their health sometimes, as some scientific papers suggest.

It is a common belief that it is good for students to have the same teacher for several years. However, I am against that idea for some reasons. First, when students have the same teacher for several years, they tend to be familiar with the teaching methods of that teacher and find it is hard to change. That leads them to be passive and inflexible in studying. Besides, working with many teachers as much as possible will make students change their attitude and their studying methods as well. Therefore, they can gain a lot of experience and precious knowledge in daily life. Secondly, I think it must be boring and dull when I have the same teacher for many years. Students usually want to try something new and interesting. So, many teachers can provoke many emotions in them. Whatever it is, it maybe changes their life in some ways. Another reason is that a new teacher is a new opportunity. Not all students have their favorite teacher at the beginning. Hence, if the first teacher is not suitable for them, it is okay. They will have the second, the third, the fourth,.. teacher until they have a suitable one. To sum up, I believe that it is better when students have new teachers each year.

A child born today is predicted to live up ninety years, an age 20 years higher than just fifty years ago. Furthermore, statistics show that in the twenty-first century when almost every day a groundbreaking new medical treatment is discovered, life expectancy will increase each year about six months. But is it actually good that lives last so long or are short, but intense lives better? The answer is clear, when keeping in mind that long lives are unnecessary, when having lived a short but intense life where everything wanted was achieved. Experiencing everything longed for, a long life would conversely be boring and depressing as nothing new can be discovered. Therefore, shorter but exciting lives should certainly be preferred. Additionally, what is clearly more appealing when having a shorter life is that there are usually no health issues. Accordingly, living an active and fun life is achieved more easily, when being young. As a result having a happy time on earth is spent much more simply than when being older.  The last and most important argument supporting the thesis that living shorter but more intensively is better than having a long life, is that dying at an old age is often connected to pain. By this, not only physical pain, caused by diseases is meant, but also emotional suffering. As a long life is lived, deaths and losses of loved ones will be experienced which can cause tremendous emotional distress. As a result, a long life is not as appealing as before when experienced without friends and family.  In conclusion, it becomes very clear, that growing old and living a calm life should be seen more critically than a short but intense life, for the various reasons explained above.

My favourite hobby to do in my free time is watching movies. I usually watch movies at home, but when I have time I like going to the cinema with my friends. I think the best place to watch a movie is at the cinema, because the screen is huge and the sound is really good. I know the tickets are expensive, but I prefer to spend money at the cinema than, for example, in a good restaurant.

Are you one of those people who like one season of the year like me? Throughout the year we can feel and see the changes of the beautiful seasons. However, all year round I look forward to the arrival of winter. The weather is pleasant and the clothes are so nice. One thing to consider is the fact that I live in a semi-desert area and almost the whole year the temperatures are very high. But in October we can start to enjoy the winter season, which means that there aren't mosquitoes, you don't sweat, you can wear beautiful clothes, and the best thing is that you're able to sleep so warm because the weather is so comfortable. In conclusion, during winter the sun doesn't burn your skin, which means that you can go out walking or camping and you'll be free of sweat and insects. The weather is simply wonderful.

In the first place I have to say that universities are spread across the entire world, there is not a single country without them. There are different ways to experience university. On one hand we have students who live at home with their family, on the other hand we have students who decide to move to another town on their own. If I had to choose where I would prefer to stay, I would surely prefer to stay with my family. Especially because they pay for my needs and I can focus on studying and passing the various exams, but most importantly I can count on the support from my family when something goes wrong. For example when you fail an exam, and you have to retake it again, it is the worst feeling you can experience. Besides, moving to another country can help a lot of students grow up. That is because it allows you to pay for your living, you have to work, to pay and you also have to study for your exams. You can make new friends in your new country, maybe friends that are attending the same school as you. By and large, scholars usually live with their family while studying, because it is simpler than going alone to a new place and leaving your comfort zone. In conclusion, as I said before I prefer to experience university by staying in my comfort zone and focus more on studying.

I like to sleep in my room with the light off and the fan on. I have a problem with the light on because I have a migraine, thereby I wake up annoyed and with a headache. I love a fan on, mainly its noise. I hate the noise that isn't the fan. Sometimes I listen to music to relax before I sleep. I usually sleep at 11:45 pm after studying English lessons. I sleep on a single bed with three pillows and one bed sheet.

Currently, some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I partly agree with this type of requirement for some reasons. It is undeniable that doing volunteer will help students gain a lot of hands-on experience. They have to do teamwork projects, hand out leaflets, take care of the old and so on. That leads them to learn how to organise events or something that they have never done before. As a result, they gain many useful skills that must be used in university. Moreover, that requirement makes students do more outdoor activities instead of doing meaningless stuff at home. Thus, they can spend their valuable time on doing good things. On the other hand, it does not always have positive sides. That high schools make students have a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate will brings them an unwilling feeling. Then, they can find it's hard to do the volunteer work effectively. They just do the volunteer work until it reaches the certain amount. So, the volunteer work loses its meaning and becomes a burden for students. Besides, doing volunteer work can distract students from their school work. They have to divide their time to do social work. So, they must balance the subjects in school and their volunteer work in a suitable way. In conclusion, I think high schools should consider the amount of the volunteer work as a strength of each student and not put stress on them. Let students do that work if they want to. Only that way, the volunteer work will literally become meaningful and effective.

There is no doubt, these days technology is really necessary for everybody, it is as important as water to a human. But these circumstances would guide the directors of schools and colleges to cancel paper from the education process. The question is, what is useful for students? Studying through computers or books? In this essay I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion. In terms of technological advantages, some research studies have made studies about this subject. They reached some results. Using a computer and other devices, such as iPads and tablets is helpful which mean it is a century language and has so much tooles. The main reason given to support this idea is, memoies information and packup at quick method by click at botom. In other words, the faster way to work encourages people to research and write more than before. On the negative side, others think technology and smart devices could affect human health. Firstly, spending a long time in front of screens while studying and consuming entertainment causes eye-sight problems. Secondly, there is a relationship between culture and paper, and it was built hundreds of years before. In conclusion, some people agree and other disagree. Therefore I believe that, we have to stand in the medial of them adapt in both of them smart divisis and books which given our selves all the benifts.

Nowadays, people have stressful lives, everyone tries to do many things in a short time, such as working, exercising, and spending time with friends and family. As a result of this lifestyle, sleep has become the only opportunity to rest. Personally speaking, I prefer sleeping with the lights off and with as little noise as possible. This is the only way that I'm able to have a pretty good rest, sometimes when I'm so exhausted I'm able to sleep with the lights on but it's not the same situation with noise, even if I'm so tired, I can't sleep. To sum up, people have different ways to sleep but the most important is that you are able to sleep a minimum of 8 hours. I believe that having a good rest results in good health for everyone.

University life is an interesting experience, and I think nowadays everyone can experience university life. In my opinion, I think it is an important experience, and the reason why I think it's really important is it will give us a lot of advantages for exploring the best version of ourselves and it is going to affect us a lot in the way we think about our future. There are many ways we can have a good experience in university life, and it depends on how we face it. Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family while they are students. I think it is not important. You can live wherever you want, you live on your own while you are attending school, that's cool, or you want to live at home with your family while you are students, that's very nice. As I said you can live wherever you want, but the most important thing is whether you enjoy living there or if you have any plan for your journey. The most important thing is you.

It's a common belief that video games can have a negative impact on children. However, I am against that idea for the following reasons. We all are in the modern world, which is full of smart equipment, so the entertainment tools of course are different from the things we used to have. Most of them have to do with technology, and video games are an example of the popular ways of entertainment with children these days. Video games are available and convenient on our modern devices, like TVs and smartphones. So, children don't have to think much about what they can play in their free time. Besides, children can be relaxed at their home instead of going to cinemas, parks, or game centres. Moreover, video games are interesting and varied. Many game manufacturers have to compete for more profits, which makes them create better video games than their rivals. Then, there are many wonderful games for your children, from educational ones to entertaining ones. Educational games can provide your children with many necessary skills to survive, such as making decisions, matching clothes, designing homes... Another reason is that your children can make friends through video games. Online video games allow people to play with others from different countries, so children can build more friendships, learn other languages, and cultures as well. It is very useful in the multicultural world. In conclusion, playing video games has many benefits that should be encouraged more.

Television is a widely used medium. Apart from it being entertaining, I also believe that it can be educative. Television can be used for multiple purposes. These are, for example, entertainment, advertising, but also education. The purpose differs per programme. The television shows on the commercial channels are often more entertaining, whereas the ones on public service broadcasting are often educational. Examples of educational programmes are documentaries about a variety of subjects, such as a new earth. There are also many educational programmes for kids, like 't klokhuis. Apart from that there are also programs which are both entertaining and educational such as 'The secret of the master' which is a painting show where the viewers also learn about art history. These shows are educational because the viewers learn from it. In conclusion, television can also be educational. It depends on the kind of television show and the purpose of the makers.

Hi Lucy, How are you? I am great. I went to a concert last week and it was spectacular. Giant Rooks was performing with Declan Mackenna as a support act. I discovered these artists on Spotify and when I heard that they were coming to the Netherlands I just had to go. Giant Rooks is an alternative indie-pop band from Germany. The songs I like most from them are Heat Up and The Birth of Worlds. Declan Mackenna is from the United Kingdom and he also writes alternative music. The visuals at the concert were great and both bands were really good live. You should check them out on Spotify. I hope I will see you soon. Kind regards, Sarah

Television is an object that we use every day for many things. Many people think that it can only entertain, but I do not agree with this idea because I think that television can also educate. I think that television is a great way to study because you can learn a lot of things from different programmes, such as documentaries, reality shows and TV shows. Furthermore, on television there are programmes that are about science, history, literature, and other things and this can help people to expand their knowledge with the programme that they are watching. For instance, if you see a documentary about something, surely after you finish it you know more things about this topic. In my opinion, television is a great method to spend time when you are bored, but it is great also if you want to learn something more.

This year is the first year at university, so I want to achieve good results, I especially want to improve my English. I can speak English, but it is not very good. I can speak but not influence. I also read and understand English documents. But my listening and writing in English is extremely bad. That is why I want to practise and learn to use English like native people.

HEALTHY LIVING According to a recent study, doing exercise is really important and useful for our health. Therefore, there is no doubt that exercise could help you in order to have a healthy life. But, do you think there are other things or activities more important than exercise? For example, I strongly believe that a good diet and sleep are important facts too. Regarding food, once somebody said to me: "What we eat is what we are." So you have to include healthy food like vegetables and fruit in your diet. On the other hand, you have to rest in a comfortable bed in order to have good mental health the following day. Doctors recommend sleeping at least eight hours per day. To sum up, there are three things to help you to have a healthy life: doing exercise every day, eating more vegetables and fruit and, last but not least, sleeping as well as you can.

Hello ! I'm Franciele and I study English by myself . There are many difficulties studying English alone and I think the most is finding good resources to learn and practice my English. Usually I watch TV shows in English without subtitles but this isn't enough to learn a different language. Recently I found Write and Improve and I felt so grateful because Write and Improve helps me with my writing skills and gives me feedback about how my writing is going. Write and Improve is so helpful because they have so many things for us to write about and it is good for all levels of English from beginner to advanced. When we finish a text, the website gives us great and useful feedback and helps us to change our mistakes and also shows us our progress if our skill is better.

LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE I strongly believe that it is really necessary and useful to know how to communicate fluently with other foreign speakers. According to a study, nowadays it´s more important than it was in the past due to globalization. We live in an increasingly connected world. This is the reason why many people choose to study a new language in another country. As you all know, to live in another country helps you to improve faster. You could meet native speakers in order to practise speaking with them. Furthermore, you can see and learn about the culture of the country. Without doubt it is a great experience. On the other hand, to be able to speak a new language helps you to look for a job. Statistics support that for many jobs you need to have language skills, such as English or Spanish. To sum up, due to globalization it is really useful and important to learn a new language.

Dear Rose, It's been a long time since I've heard from you. Is everything alright? I've been thinking about your question for a while now and I think I have finally found my favourite film.

In the beginning of the film, everything is very happy and the girl is living an amazing life. However, near the ending, it becomes clear that she has an illness which will prevent her from growing old.

Music courses can be commonly found in Indonesia. Although it is common, some people assume that music classes should not be a mandatory subject for every student. Music is each person's personal interest and students should not be forced to learn it. Music may be important in modern society as music has been a part of humans' life since the ancient era. However, some part of the community may not be interested in learning music and just love to listen to those melodies. In addition, there may be some people who totally hate music for personal reasons. Moreover, music can be learned by autodidact. A recent survey claims that learning will be more effective when students are sincerely learning it and not by curriculum enforcement. However, schools should still provide music classes and set them to be elective classes as some students may need tutors to learn how to play musical instruments. To conclude, music is an important part of the community, but it is not appropriate to be a mandatory subject in school. Instead, schools should make music classes an elective subject to encourage students' sincerity in learning it.

Hi Paul, What's up? I'm writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things, but, first of all, let me tell you that I hope you and your family are doing good. To begin with, I would like to mention one of my favourite dishes, which is called "porra." This meal consists of a cold soup made of some fresh vegetables, specifically tomatoes, green peppers, and garlic. Once the soup is made, you can add a little olive oil in order to flavour it. Besides, you can introduce some proteins, such as boiled egg, tuna, or some cured ham. I assure you it is delicious and quite tasty. With regard to the proper time to eat it, I would like to point out that it is a dish which is mostly eaten in summer, due to the high temperatures we have to deal with. That's why cold soups are perfect for summertime. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned, as is the case of the difficulties in finding these ingredients in other seasons, let alone the quality of the products. Despite the downsides, I can't help but say that I do enjoy eating this food, even though vegetables were not my cup of tea when I was younger, but now that I am aware of their importance in our diet, I appreciate them more than ever. What about you? Is there any food you enjoy eating? Let me know if there is. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

Zoos are excellent places for people to visit on many special occasions, like birthdays, anniversaries, and so on. However, it is thought that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. I am against that idea for the following reasons. We all know that zoos are other shelters of animals accept for their natural habitats. Zoos make a contribution to conserving wild animals and endangered animals as well. Zookeepers take the responsibility for feeding and caring for animals. That leads to animals not having to seek their food while under danger anymore. Moreover, they can survive in a safe and convenient environment: they don't need to camouflage or do anything to avoid being attacked by their rivals because their cages are totally separated from others. Medical services and special care are always provided in any cases. Besides, animals can give birth under beneficial conditions thanks to trained zoo staff. Another reason is that zoos are wonderful places for people to learn about animals. Instead of going to the deep forests or mysterious valleys, people can easily observe animals and learn about their habits. Moreover, zoos are also ideal places to spend the weekend and just relax after hard working hours. To sum up, zoos are still necessary places for people these days.

'It drives me up the wall!', said one student early this morning when he, sitting next to a computer screen, learned that all university students be advised to exercise three times a week. This notice was immediately understood as an abrasive and nosy by many students, but, not so surprisingly, there is a good reason for embedding this rule. The research shows university student in general and computer nerds in particular are activity-deprived individuals with a fitness level so poor it raises a red flag for their physicians. Not only have some students stopped any exercising, but they have substantially minimized their exposure to sun, fresh air, and shockingly, some of them even do not leave their dormitories any more. Although the lockdown and curfew exacerbates the situation further, the real problem is mostly the inherent laziness of the students. Therefore, the college council suggested mandatory sports activities at least three times a week for everyone. Albeit justifiable, the decision triggers a question of personal freedom. Can the council indeed force students to engage in sports activities? Some argue this is simply illegal, and thus, impossible to do so. But, this coin has another side as well. The council is a body fully responsible for well-being of students and as such, it is entitled to take care of their mental and physical health. Therefore, the above-mentioned statement is conceivable. Clearly, this non-trivial affair will ignite a fierce dispute in the next student assembly. But, given the usual bland and boring discussions, it is a great achievement as well. Our colleague Bend-Over shrewdly commented this situation is a lose-lose situation: students are mad at the council, therefore they will hesitate to exercise. He gingerly suggested to encourage students' sporting activity by providing them free access to the gym and the swimming pool.

I would like to write about my favourite season of the year. I would definitely like to say that it is winter. Some people say that they like spring, autumn, or summer. But I would just like to say that spring and summer are damp and hot. Also, there are a lot of insects, especially in summer. So, there is also a lot of noise of chirping, inevitably. Therefore, you cannot sleep at night. On the other hand, winter is quiet, calm, and fresh. You can be in warm and comfortable clothes as well. Indeed, it could also be freezing and therefore stressful. However, that is what it is. In winter, you are able to enjoy a lot of warm food and soup. What is more, you are able to sleep under a warm blanket comfortably. In any case, I am sure that all people are going to agree that winter is tranquil. I love such a quiet time, wholeheartedly.

In my opinion, knowing English is fundamental for students who want to communicate with the rest of the world. As we all know, English is a common language in the world. Therefore, the language is significant to be learned and when one has the ability to speak English can work, and it is easier to communicate with people with whom one lives The importance of learning English for me is going back to my childhood. During my childhood years I listened to English songs virtually every day and I recognized that it made me feel relief while I was hearing the language, and I became interested in understanding English. Also, I have a dream to travel around the world, so I decided to learn English. I have been studying by reading articles, books, the news, and listening to song, and sometimes I just turn on the TV and watch some English movies or a stand-up event.

The best holiday I had was in 2019, because I made my first trip with my mother travelling on a plane. It was so nice, I already had travelled on a plane, but when I was a kid. Now I am 19 years old, and on the day of the flight I was 18 years old. This holiday was close to Christmas. When I got back with her, my cousin and my grandmother were waiting for us in my house. After so many years, finally I met my grandmother again. It was after 10 years. The first time I saw her, I was 8 years old, now I have other head etc. This holiday was special for me, because I realized my dream, because I met my favorite singer. She was in my room on the same day as my grandmother. Besides that, everyone needs to have a special moment in their life. I had my moment when I met my favorite singer. She gave me a gift and I started freaking out, it was so insane and wonderful. I'm so grateful for this special moment and this was the best holiday ever in my life.

Sometimes people want to find something brand new and almost their priority is going abroad. I have realized that there is the same thing happening to students: some of them choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. Of course, it always has both advantages and drawbacks. I want to start with the advantages first. Studying abroad is an opportunity for students to have access to a different study environment. There, they can work with foreigners as much as possible. That leads them to learn other languages quickly and effectively. Moreover, the amount of knowledge they gain is significant. Students will become familiar with modern study equipment, scientific teaching methods, and the working styles of foreigners. Therefore, it is easy for them when they have a chance to work in an international company or embassy. So, they will make a contribution to developing their mother country. Besides, when students study abroad, they will gain more experience. Because they have to live far away from their family, they have no choice but to take care of themselves. They will know how to prepare a meal and manage their money. Another advantage is that students can make more friends and enjoy the feeling of being a traveller while they are studying. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of studying abroad. The noticeable thing I want to say is feeling homesick. Students will miss their family and their classmates a lot and feel alone sometimes. Besides, in the beginning, they maybe get some culture shocks and can't adapt to other customs. My friend studied abroad in China and she hadn't eaten any Chinese dishes until then. Moreover, people can be subjected to racism when they study abroad because of their skin color or their cultures. Sometimes there are annoying people who enjoy playing a trick on others. In conclusion, studying abroad has its own advantages and drawbacks. However, "One day of travel will bring you a wealth of wisdom."

How will we travel in the future ? It is an interesting question. I am trying to reply to it. Currently, new cars are invented. These new cars work with electric motors, without petrol. Others can drive without drivers! These cars have a computer as a driver. Maybe, in the 2050's, motorcycles, cars, lorries, and trains could transport everyone without producing pollution, but not yet for the airplanes. Traffic will be less noisy than today. There will also be fewer car accidents. Unfortunately, driver's licences will not exist, which will make people less independent. However, people need to think about which future they wish. In fact, lorry and ship traffic are issues for the planet. Lorries, airplanes, and ships use very much petrol to transport different objects for sale. A lot of things must travel to be sold to customers. We need to think what customer we will become, with which behavior. These thoughts force us to turn into our ways to use cars, lorries, airplanes, and ships.

I think that Write and Improve is a greatly useful program for English language learners, especially people who want to practise their writing. Thanks to this program, I am sure that I have gotten used to writing English sentences. I assume that getting used to writing is very important for English language learners. It actually benefits you, because you are going to find some kinds of useful impressions. I was lucky enough to find Write and Improve. I think that all learners who want to improve their writing skill should use Write and Improve. This program is actually similar to writing a diary. I suppose that most people would agree that writing a diary is going to improve their English. However, there is a problem. There is not always something to write for your diary, although most people have it. This program allows us to write something in English if we do not have anything to write. So, people who use Write and Improve are able to improve their skills in any case. Last but not least, this program gives you feedback. You are able to recognise your mistakes in your sentences easily. This is very useful and important for learners of English. Although it is a shame that sometimes I cannot understand why my sentence is not good, it is useful, anyway. I am going to use this for a long time as well. However, it would be the best to be taught from an English tutor so that we could be better writers in English.

This time, I would like to write about a problem, which is about medical doctors. It is that most medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money. Yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I think that the reason for this problem is about money. So, if the doctors in rural areas get as much money as the other doctors who work in cities, the problem would be solved. Because the doctors who work in cities do not need to work in cities for their money. Then, how this could be done? I think that the government should control it. They should collect and distribute money to doctors in their countries, fairly. Therefore there will not be any inequalities in the salary. Thus the doctors in rural areas are not going to need to think about their money. I think that I have to read more English sentences so that I will be able to improve my writing skill. The sentences which I have written above are horrible.

It is very tricky to answer the question, "Are there things that are more important than exercise for our health?" To be honest, I think that exercise is the most effective way to improve our health. First, exercise keeps your body fit and flexible. When you do yoga, karate, or just simply do morning exercise, you must move and use many parts of your muscles. That leads to releasing energy and reducing the unnecessary lipids. At the same time, your limbs will be familiar with that intense training, so your movement can be flexible and you can do more things than before easily. As a result, your strength gradually improves. Apart from the physical benefits, you will gain a pleasant mental health. According to an article written by a group of scientists at Oxford, exercise can reduce stress and help you to have better sleep. As far as I'm concerned, a person who frequently exercises has more positive energy and is more carefree than somebody who doesn't. Moreover, exercise is a cheap way to improve our health compared to other ways, like going to a healthcare centre or hiring a private doctor. Besides, it can enhance our patience and self-control. In conclusion, exercise is important for our health for special ways that no method has.

Telling the truth is an interesting subject to discuss together. In my opinion, it is really important to speak the truth but everything always has two sides, the good side, and the bad side because I think telling the truth is good or not depending on you and also depending on the situation. If you want to make others happy but you know the truth will hurt them and you don't want it to happen, then it is acceptable to tell a lie. I think a lie with a good purpose is better than telling the truth but it's going to hurt others. I think it is difficult to figure out if telling truth or lie is a good thing. As I said it is good or not. It depends on you and also depends on the situation, so there will not be a specific formula for us to apply. As I know people tell a lie every single day and when they tell a lie they are not even thinking about it. Humans always tell a lie but it is a harmless lie. In some situations you have to tell the truth because if you tell a lie, it is going to affect other people in a bad way. Telling the truth is very important in work because when you tell the truth, everyone in your work can know about the bad things in their job and they can improve. In some situations telling a lie is better than telling the truth, such as to a friend you have just meet.

There is no doubt that schools nowadays change faster than ever, as we see the differences year by year. I imagine if I travelled into space and came back to earth 10 years from now, I would be too old to catch up with the new systems that would be developed. But how so? I think that in the future schools will have more classes and each class will include only 10 to 15 kids so that the teacher can make sure they all understand. I imagine self - learning will be implemented on a regular basis since self - learning will be a thing technology will be required as will, I think moving forward, exams with open books will be normal for kids, and teachers will be more creative coming up with their exam questions since they will evaluate students understanding rather than memorizing the information. I imagine that mental health education will be included. What will remain in the future is the need for teachers. Technology will stay as well. I believe sports will be played more often since these classes encourage creativity and play a big role in mental health.

School areas will be different from now. In the time of the corona virus we can see a lot of changes in schools. It is online teaching, online education, online homework, etcetera. I think the old times won't come back again in the same way. Learning at home is better for many students because they do not wake up early. This will only affect certain subjects. Children might know what they want to do better than other people. In big cities there are many possibilities for them. We had a good education and we could go to school without masks. We knew everything in our mind. There are more difficulties than before. Children will be fine and they will be working alone with online courses. The school of the future is present and I am looking forward to learning new things. We will have to change our mind and our old behaviour and look to the future and go with new technologies. Many things are better for them and they can choose the best ways for them. We will see in future years. Thank you.

AUTUMN: THE MOST COLORFUL SEASON OF THE YEAR If someone asked me what my favourite season was, surely I would say autumn. Autumn is a wonderful season for many reasons: 1) It is the season when the leaves starts to fall and the ground become colorful like an artist's painting. 2) In autumn there are a great number of celebrations, like Bonfire night and Halloween, which are celebrated in many countries. 3) Autumn is the season when the school starts in many countries , and this can be really enjoyable (especially for parents). Personally I love autumn because it is a warm season and it makes me feel comfortable, and also because I love the color and the food of this season. Furthermore, I like autumn because in my country, which is Italy, we have a lot of celebrations and festivals that are linked with this time of the year. Autumn is the best season.

During studying students face some difficulties, one of them is being a student far away from family. Actually, this has both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, studying away from family has more advantages than disadvantages. While studying far from home at first it might be hard to struggle some challenges like finding a house or a job for living by themselves without family funding. Throughout these difficulties students will have a chance to struggle them and it will be a lesson to them and it will be a lesson for them on how to live alone and how to overcome those problems. For example, a student during his or her education term in another city moreover in another country has a chance for him or her to take control of using and saving their money, which will help their life in future, whereas studying with their family might be easier but rest of their life they might face some challenges and they must solve and manage them alone. So as I mentioned in the above paragraph, for students it is more beneficial being far away from family during their education. As a result, they could manage their budget or how to settle their life without assistance of their family. These simple examples could help the rest of their life.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Because health is the most basic thing of human life . Living with health is more vital than being rich. Health and wealth are expendable things, but there is a difference between them. If health is lost it can be very difficult to regain it, whereas money could be regained in the case of you losing it. Therefore, humans must take care of their health. With this they can easily work and earn money. Not having a healthy life has no meaning, no matter how much money he or she has. Because of this our primary concern must be to be healthy rather than to be rich. Because if people care about their health they can continue their life. Thus, in my opinion being healthy is crucial for people. Despite gaining money, good health sometimes can be lost forever. But it does not mean money is worthless, sometimes people need money to regain their health to work and enjoy life.

I think that enclosed workstations or cubicles are preferable for employees rather than open designs. It is undoubtedly true that some employees want to be in a private space. It is not necessarily true that the open atmosphere has an advantage over the closed one. Moreover, the employees who do not want to be in an open space would feel stressed if they were in such an open area. On the other hand, the other employees, who want to be in a more open space, can go to more open areas. For example, there should be meeting rooms or lobbies. When they want to communicate with other employees, they are able to do it in such open spaces. Therefore, the employees who are introvert do not have to feel pressured. If anything, the employees who are extrovert should go out to open places. This is why I think that enclosed workstations or cubicles are preferable for a lot of people. Despite that, I think that most people prefer the enclosed ones. I assume that open designs have the advantage of getting the employees to be more cooperative because they have to be more open if they were in such situations. I suppose that it would be better in a sense, whether or not they like it.

I think that the requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate is a good idea because the students are able to get a good experience from that volunteer work. For instance, they are able to know that doing things which are helpful to people is very rewarding. What is more, to do so, they are able to feel that they are a member of society. It would be a very good thing for their mentality. People should think about their society, even when they are young, so that they would be sure that they have to help each other to live in the world. This is why I think that having the requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate is a good idea. It would be better if it is done before they graduate from their high school, because they are about to be adults. By the way, there would be some students who cannot do those kinds of work, due to some kinds of problems. In those cases, they do not necessarily have to do it. Instead, the schools should provide something for them.

Let's be clear. My favourite season of the year is spring by far. To tell you the truth, the main reason is because I can wear all of my clothes, no matter what the time is. During spring, it's not as cold as it could be in autumn or in winter. However, the weather isn't as hot as in summer. It offers several things. The first one is to be able to go out without worrying about the temperatures outside. On the other hand, the vegetation is growing in this period. So having a walk, either in the parks or in the gardens, becomes a real privilege. Finally, this is usually the season of the big events of the year, like the festivals and so on. I could also say that in France you have a lot of holidays in this period, so you're really free to rest and enjoy the season.

Watching television is horrible because it is a waste of our time. Always. I would like to say that we can see a lot of people watching series and other spots. A lot of time is wasted. One solution would be to only programme educational videos. For example, National Geographic, etc. Entertainment is around us a lot. We had a television when I was younger. I watched only fairy tales and some news. This time our children are watching television nonstop without breaks. The television and computer are capital devices for them. They are still going to. I have to set some rules. I will have to set a time for entertainment and for education. A separate time for each one. We will see whether it is OK for them. They can watch TV only in the morning, any other time they will not have their devices. I think that that will be good for them. That is all that I can say on this topic. I think it was necessary to say it. We will see. Thank you.

Many people claim that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Personally speaking, I agree with this statement. Firstly, owing to the fact that if we don't have a good health condition, we can't enjoy our life. Therefore, it doesn't matter if we have a lot of money because we won't be able to benefit from it. Secondly, for the reason that if we are healthy we can do sports or spend time with our family and we don't need to be rich to do these things. Although for me the most important thing is to have a well-balanced life. Consequently, I believe that we should take care of our habits in order to have a healthy life and at the same time have enough money to be financially free. In conclusion, being healthy is by far more important than being rich. Nevertheless, we must be careful with our finances due to the fact that they are relevant for our life.

Although I feel that students should not be required to have any compulsory lectures, I also support that they should take some particular ones or responsibilities for graduation. The most famous responsibility type given at schools is volunteer work. I base my idea on two reasons. First and foremost, working as a volunteer gives students responsibility for a task. With the aim of completing their tasks, they try to finish their work and this experience will most probably help them not only graduate but also to land a job in the future. Secondly, volunteers contribute to the workforce in marketplace while doing their tasks and needy people benefit from these volunteers' contributions very much. Thanks to their efforts, according to recent statistics, the volunteering process at schools has become much more important than before. Authorities of schools focus on these tasks. In a nutshell, volunteering is very beneficial to both students and people who need help. Through this way, students can get good grades, graduate and find a good job.

Dear Sam, It is really important nowadays to learn at least one foreign language. The reason why is because the world has become very small with the development these days people could meet. These days people can meet, speak, and work in a different country only if they speak the language that the country has. learning English is something that is necessary because English is an international language. In jobs and businesses, if you know a foreign language you will know how to deal with difficult situations, such as customer service issues or commuitng with people. In studies and education, if you would like to apply for a master's degree or PhD you need to learn a foreign language.

Dear Sarah, It is a really important thing to learn a language nowadays. In the past, people spoke only one language, but now we need to learn many languages for many reasons, like studying, working, entertainment , travelling, and education. Like if you want to apply to study abroad in the UK you have to prepare for the IELTS exam by receiving some past papers and using websites to help to improve your language skills. In addition, people who love travelling also have to learn lots of languages: English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. It is the best thing to have a talent for learning languages and technology. In my opinion, if you want to learn languages, firstly, write down your goals. Why do you want to learn this language? Secondly, you need to make sure to have an excellent outfit.

In spite of countless examples and benefits of working in offices without having walls, like the one at the Google, I strongly hold the belief that it is much more efficient to work in enclosed workplaces. I based my choice on two reasons. First and foremost, I personally can not concentrate on my work while I am in open area where other people, even if they are my co-workers, can easily gaze at me. Provided that I have a personal area, I can burn the midnight oil unhesitatingly. Without listening to conversations, music and unnecessary and unimportant trivial sayings, I most probably manage to do my best. For instance, last week I worked in a cubic for a project. Unfortunately, other peoples' voices disturbed me so much that our company lost getting the government financial aid for the project since I failed to submit a well-prepared draft. Secondly, time goes too fast. There are many innovations and developments not only in technology but also in other fields. Thus, it should be ready to be open to new things. Even though it seems to be a new, modern approach to work in open areas, independent, homeoffice working is a newer, recent step taken by employers. In a nutshell, it is better to work in a personal space for me to be able to roll up my sleeves. Through this way of working, I can focus on my tasks much more efficiently. What's more, working individually and independently is a new working style in today's world.

Dear members of the town council, I agree with your idea, banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants is great, but we must think carefully about it. First, can we punish everybody that uses mobile phones? Do we have enough laws? Do we have staff to check and punish in all these places? It is very important to consider this, because the law needs to be obeyed. You should remember how the mobile phone is part of life nowadays. Everybody, everywhere uses this equipment, all the time, so it will not be easy to change it. It will be so hard to change it. What can we do? We can only prepare it for this, be persevering, make a lot of effort, and we must prepare for a strong reaction against this law. It is very important to raise consciousness in our population. We live in a small town, so if we conquest the minds and hearts we will have success with the law. We need to show that the law is important for the integration of the population. Here everybody knows each other, but currently nobody talks in public spaces. What is the reason? The addiction to the mobile phone. Many people use the public spaces and the restaurants to look at this device. They could understand that the law is crucial for society.

In my opinion, learning music and playing some instrument must be given as a class because music will help students to relax after a long and tiring school day. Most students have some classes they do not like such as math or literature. During some classes like these some of them get bored with this learning and to enjoy something, music could be an option for them and studying music and playing musical instruments should be chosen by students and it can be more effective and faster for their learning. Also students should be educated about everything and should know at least some information about those things so music and playing a musical instrument is one of them. Some students may have a talent to play a musical instrument very well rather than learning math or literature. That is why students have a chance to improve their talent instead of studying in a class which they do not like or do not have the passion to learn.

In my opinion, books are the most important things in our life. Because books teach us "What is life?" and "How can we live fairly?." There are lots of factors which books teach us. So, I am against computers and tablets replacing books in life. They shouldn't replace them completely, at least. We know technology improves and is extensive but as I said before, they shouldn't replace them completely. We need to touch the paper of books and we need to feel them. Books are beautiful and valuable like this. Hence, we should take possession of them and protect them against those who want to eliminate them.,. there are many things which we learn from books. We shouldn't permit any technological development to replace books. On the other hand, we must read more and more and improve ourselves. I admire all books.

Here in Brazil we just have normal classes and this isn't good because we don't have a distraction from all the classes. I think studying music is a good thing because it is helpful for students to have more discipline and learning how to play some instrument can be good for the student as an extracurricular activity. In the USA it is so common that all the schools teach music in the classes and, in my opinion, it is so good. A song is so helpful with feelings and with one's mood. Moreover the young are always listening to music. Learning music is a good way to forget the problems with other disciplines and it helps too with making friends. It is always good to learn something new. Maybe if all schools have music classes, the students are gonna be so much more excited to go to school instead of staying at home watching something on TV. So if you are thinking about put some music classes in your school, I say that is the best thing to do now.

Hello Michael, how are you? Have you ever tasted a cemita? A cemita is like a Mexican version of a burger with totally different ingredients, the main ingredient is a milanesa, a breaded steak. Other typical ingredients of a cemita are: avocado, onion, beans, mayo, papalo: a herb with a spicy taste, and a very, very hot sauce. Generally, cemitas are huge and they are cut in two halves because it is impossible to bite them when they are whole. I usually eat cemitas when I go to the downtown area, there is a place with a variety of local food and their special dish is a cemita.

In my opinion, all students in schools should study music in their classes. I assume that, generally, people in the world love music. They have to know about music to some extent. So, at least, they should play musical instruments for some time. For example, I think that the piano would be a good example for the students to play a musical instrument. And then, hopefully, it is preferable if there were some kind of study which is related to music. What is more, learning to play a musical instrument with the other students would help the student work with their classmates. Playing music as a part of the band would be a good experience for the students as well. I do not think that playing music has to be obligatory, but it should be studied to some degree. This is why I think that all students in schools should study music in their classes. By the way, I do not disagree that there are some people who hate music. In that case, they do not have to study music in school. Music should be loved, and that is an important thing.

I think that university students should move away and live on their own while they are attending school. Thus, they are able to nurture their independence. When they are adults, they have to live by themselves. I suppose that a university student is half adult, and half child. Therefore, when they are at university, they should also get used to living on their own. Hopefully, they are able to get their parents' help. Of course, they should not completely depend on their parents, but they should depend on their parents to some extent. For example, their parents should pay school expenses. What is more, the students should not work for money. They must not forget that they are at university for their studies. However, I agree that working for experience is good for the student's experience. On the other hand, there are some students who live at home with their family while they are students. I do not think that is a bad thing. Living with the family would benefit to their finance. In most cases, they do not have to do housework on their own. Consequently, they are able to have more time to study. It is definitely a good thing. On balance, moving away and living at home, both of them are not bad at all.

I play a video game in my free time. I usually play a video game on the weekend, especially at night between six o'clock and midnight. I like to do this activity because it de-stresses me, gives me pleasure, cheers me up, and fascinates me. It happens due to the fact that playing a video game is an activity that holds my attention and stimulates my critical thinking. The last time I played a video game was four years ago.

Well, I believe that sometimes it is acceptable to tell a lie. It is very difficult, maybe impossible, to tell the truth all the time. It will be hard, and so disagreeable telling the truth all the time. Imagine if you tell the truth to your wife all the time. You stopped to talk with a friend in the street, nothing wrong, but your wife needed you quickly, so you said that the traffic was bad, because of this you were late, end of the story, no fight, no problem. There are many examples to show how it is reasonable to lie sometimes, for instance, if a person asks you about her clothes, or about her new hair colour, or about the results of the plastic surgery, and you consider it ugly, or a disaster. What should you say? The truth? Is it worth it? Of course not. It's better to lie, perhaps not totally lie. It is not necessary to say it is beautiful, but you can say it is not bad (the truth is it is bad), but what's the value of making the person sad? It is better to tell a little lie. Sometimes it is important to tell a little lie too about perspectives about life too, for example about someone's health, about the economic situation, about reality. It is not necessary to be crude.

In my opinion, both points have their advantages and disadvantages. I will start with living at the university with other students. The first advantage that comes to my mind is that the experience can be amusing and you will remember it for the rest of your life. Another advantage which I think is quite interesting is the fact that you'll be forced to leave your comfort zone. Therefore you'll have to buy your own groceries, prepare your meals, do the washing and so on. However, there are some disadvantages too. For instance, your mates can lead you to an unhealthy life and you can lose your focus and as a result get bad marks in your exams. Besides, if you live away you probably will spend more money. Let's talk now about living with your family while you're studying. Firstly, if you are living with your parents you'll be able to save more money. Secondly, you have more chances to be more focused in your exams for the reason that you won't have bad influences. In conclusion, both options are pretty good, but if I had to choose between one of the two I would choose to live at the university with other students due to the fact that it's a more enjoyable experience.

Yesterday, my children argued about the purpose of television. One said that it could entertain in many ways and played a vital role in the modern era. However, the other insisted that it also educated people in many areas. And I very much appreciated it. First of all, television can entertain people. With a large number of films and game shows and the news, people can relax after a hard day. Almost all TV programs are recreational and amusing, which makes you laugh immediately . In that way, television is an ideal means for you to kill time. Moreover, TV manufacturers have created some kind of smart televisions that you can even play video games with and sing karaoke on with others. They also allow you to connect to the Internet and access social media. Therefore, television is an ideal means of entertainment. Besides, television can educate people in different areas. Many educational programs for kids are published like 'Wildlife' or 'Spell with Mrs. Jenny." Moreover, there are some game shows that provide viewers with life skills. I learned a lot of ways to cook in 'ABC's kitchen'. In conclusion, television not only entertains but also educates.

It is often said that it is important to always tell the truth, but it is ever acceptable to tell a lie? Firstly, I want to state that I agree with this phrase. As I see it, if you want to be someone who can be trusted by other people and have their confidence you have to be honest with them and, no matter what, tell the truth. Besides, if you are someone who normally tell lies, then you have a big chance of forgetting the lies you had told and therefore people will notice it and as a consequence you will lose your credibility. Although there are some cases in which you can be allowed to tell a lie in order to relieve others' pain. For instance, imagine that your dog is sick and sadly he dies, so now you have to explain it to your children. Don't you think that instead of explaining them that your dog has died you could tell them that your dog has found his mother and he has gone to live with her? In conclusion, I'm one of those who tries to be honest and always tells the truth, owing to the fact that, in the end, you know what is real and what not and for this reason I believe that there is no point in telling lies to other people.

Health and wealth are both crucial points in the life of people. Health is an essential part of our lives. Indeed without it some issues could take place associated with our body and our mind. Health is crucial for everyone and every person should take care of their own health. However, for many people, wealth is more important than being healthy due to the fact that being a wealthy person allows you to do a huge number of thing and it permits you to live a better life. Personally, I do not agree with this idea as I think that being healthy is more important and more essential than being rich. Indeed good health is important in the life of all people and without it we cannot live. Health and wealth are both crucial for everyone, but having good health is surely the main thing that we should have in our life.

Dear Sam, Each person has different ideas and opinion in general but talking about university students, some love to live with their families to help and support them for their needs in like buying food and drinks for them, school needs, clean their rooms and give them some money. For example, if they want to visit or meet their friend in a cafe or mall, surely their parents will give them some money. In my opinion, it is very nice for university students to live alone but you need to have a good job and great organisation, like you need to do everything alone like organising your time, make food for yourself, clean your flat alone or if you share it with people you have to be collaborative and a hard worker . The important part is to concentrate on your studies and get a higher grade, be brave to pass all your exams and grateful. For me, I think passing your exams with a B+ grade is a really high achievement .

University life is so different from normal life. I think living with your family at home is better than living alone unless you study abroad, or the area where you live does not have any universities at all, or your family have difficult circumstances. I guess living with your family at home is the best thing that you will have because most of the students at universities around the world do not have good jobs. The majority of them have jobs but it will not pay all their fees at the university, like working in a shop as a salesperson or a waiter in a restaurant . So, living with your family has a lot of advantages, like they will pay your university fees even if you are working and there is someone who will look after you and your responsibilities. They will take care of you to help you and to guide you and also your other family members. So, have you ever thought of living alone? Think about it and see how much you will need because it is a high responsibility and I believe it is not a good idea.

Dear Ms Sara, I am writing this email to you to send you my own composition about television. It is a really good thing that we use the television for entertainment because it is the cheapest entertainment in the world. In the past, before internet, people had a television in their houses to have fun, such as by watching movies and series, watching the news, and songs. In some areas, people in cafes were watching football matches with each other, but television also had another use, for instance, for education. There are a lot of TV channels and programs on TV that help students of different ages to learn, such as the BBC for learning English. It is a great listening method that you could use to do listening practice that will help you to improve your listening and speaking skills. Another example is Cartoon Network, it is an excellent choice that children them excellent would watch. It has a lot of great advice in a really simple way which children can understand. What do you think Ms ? Let me know about your ideas. Best wishes, Sam

They'd announced they were going to have a concert, but they kept the location and date secret for a while. Out the blue, they said they were going to have it in my town.

In the world there are plenty of things that must be done without any money or a course grade, for example, feeding an animal, funding a student or helping someone who is in need. We can sequence this event more and more so that people can learn and be taught by their parents and especially by their teacher during their education. In order to avoid and prevent humans from becoming selfish, parents and schools have a responsibility. Therefore, if humans want to have a better future for their beings, helping each other without any response, such as money or something else, they should grow up children to learn how to act and do some work or help people as volunteers and it starts with family, then continues in schools. Children are more open to learning things than older people. Therefore, during their school if they learn to help their friends as volunteers it will be a part of their life and become a habit for them. The rest of their life they can be more helpful and it will gain them respect from others, for example, if a teacher asks students to clean their classroom or a garden which belongs to the school and they always play games and do sports activities after they do it voluntarily, they could comprehend and recognise keeping clean their environment is important for them and the rest of the other students. Then it will be a habit to do something beneficial for them and nature as volunteers. So superficially willing may not be a behavior to earn money but insight of that is a great thing for nature and the world. No one knows who will need help in this life and times always change. Sometime our life might turn out and we may need help that time if we have not enough money than the life would be so hard upon these people must learn and we may need help that time. If we don't have enough money then life would be so hard. these people must learn and act voluntarily so it must be taught in schools.

The W&I website is a tool I've been using for some time and as an experienced user I have some thoughts and tips that may help others. The Cambridge provided website offers access to different task levels plus a test zone. The work done is stored so we can check and try to improve a past activity at any moment, this being a good way to verify our improvement over time. As we're dealing with an AI resource - there is no teacher checking the activities, only artificial intelligence - it's essential to keep in mind that some things can look a little odd in the feedback, with moments when we're sure everything is alright, but the website keeps asking for some changes to be made. My overall opinion is that W&I is a good resource for those who want to improve their writing abilities in English with instant feedback, but knowing the tool uses AI and so some error may occur with the feedback provided. Nonetheless the website can be a good learning tool as long as complemented with the habit of reading and listening to nowadays English content, so when there's a doubt about the feedback we have enough baggage to deal with it and decide what's right or not.

I have discovered "Write and Improve" randomly. It was kind of suggested to me. Anyway "Write and Improve" is really good opportunity to put your thoughts into words and to get feedback instantly. To learn a language it is important to write and to structure your thoughts. The site is structured in different levels, so you can choose the levels that suit you best. You can choose the topic about what you want to write and a requirement for word sets. After entering your text and you get an assessment and classification of your language ability. In addition you get notes on suspected errors, which is really helpful. Furthermore you have a run chart and an overview about your language level, which helps you to follow your development and makes your language education transparent. I can recommend this site and this kind of learning. In our school days we had the task to write and summarize a story. I think it is great way to learn a language. It is not enough to learn vocabulary or to watch a movies in your goal language. As I mentioned you have to put your thoughts into words and to use the new vocabulary.

Hello classmate, My name is Xinh and I hope you are having a nice day. Today, we have an interesting topic. This is about your opinions about taking care of yourself. It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. And I agree with this opinion. I think health is very important for everyone. If you don't have good health, there are many things you can't do.,. maybe you will lose many good opportunities in your life. If you have good health, you can easily travel everywhere, you can easily work on everything and some things. As you know, there is a lot of work to do in your life, and if you are wealthy, I can't compete with other people around you. You are always struggling with many things in your life, and of course, good health is needed. Trust me, if you are healthier than many people around here, you can go faster and become rich if you try your best. If you are rich but in bad health, it will take you a lot of money and time to heal, and there are even diseases that cannot be cured like cancer... I know there are many people that have worked a lot without taking care of themselves. They earned a lot of money. But when they recognized any health problems, it was too late. Of course, money is very important, but you should enhance the time, money and work. You need to work to make money , but don't let it rule you.

Sleeping is one of the necessary things in a human's life. And the place to sleep is an important factor that is directly related to your quality of sleep. In my view, I would choose to sleep in a dark and quiet room for some reasons. In a recent report by The Department of Health, light will make you find it hard to sleep. You will have a feeling as if it is day time and outdoors and light makes you conscious and active. So, it may take you a long time to fall asleep. Another element for a nice sleep is sound. The atmosphere around you should be peaceful and quiet. Therefore, you won't be distracted by other stuff and feel comfortable enough to be relaxed after a hard day. I recommend that you should play some instrumental music or ballad songs. They are said to have positive effects on the quality of human sleep. In a nutshell, a dark and quiet room is the most ideal environment for me to sleep.

I like to sleep by being in a quiet room, but having a small light at the corner of the room because I'm still a bit scared of the dark. When I sleep in a dark, quiet place it relaxes my mind from any problems or stress that I might have during the day. When you sleep in a dark place your mind is more likely to switch off because of the lack of light, so I can have a good night's rest for the next day. That is how I like to sleep.

I have listed loads of stuff I want to work on. Currently, I major in English teaching at the Hanoi National University of Education , and I'm completely pleased with my area that I decided to pursue from scratch. There are a lot of memorable experiences as well as challenges that I learned a lot from. I learned how to plan lessons, designed many detailed slides to present in front of a bunch of people, and did teamwork effectively. Besides, I still find that I'm deficient in many important skills, such as outdoor activities and communication skills. They are also my weakness and the reason why I didn't gain any scholarship in my first semester. But I will make an effort to improve them day by day. I will participate in one of the clubs at school and be more active when doing outside activities. At the same time, I plan to have a part-time job as a private teacher. So, I will gain more experience in my area and my communication skills will be enhanced. I always believe that one day, I can store enough knowledge to be an expert in my area. Then, I will use all the things I learned at university to help my students on their studying route.

I guess that is a problem. Nobody wants to live in the back country. After finishing such a tough study like, in this case, medicine, that is not easy. For a lot of students it is difficult to have access to study, because of their financial situation. Many students have to take on debt, to pay the fee, rents and other bills. Then should those people be sent somewhere in the back country? That doesn't seem fair to me. After their study they have to invest also a lot of money in the practice, devices and equipment. There is no end of debt in sight. In addition what is also very important is social life. For singles it would be very difficult to live in the back country without a partner maybe. There might be people maybe with family they would like to live there and to enjoy the life out of the city. On the other hand, there are families, for whom that is really important to have access to things which an urban city offers. A fair and right distribution I guess is very difficult. It depends on needs, social situation, preferences and lifestyle, where the people decide to live. We as patients require a good treatment when we go to the doctor and therefore the doctor has to be satisfied.

Telling the truth is not always easy. However, there are situations in which a lie is preferable. Many people argue that lying is one of the worst things one can do and always telling the truth is very important. Whether I believe so as well will be discussed in the following. First of all, it has to be mentioned that the legitimacy of a lie is depending on the situation. A lie is legit and weconsider a lie as legit if nobody was badly affected. However, the importance of a certain situation has to be analysed carefully. For instance, when only once arriving delayed at school the importance of that situation would not be crucial and no one would be violated physically or mentally. Nevertheless, the danger of analysing a situation unsuitably still exists. Furthermore, I do not recommend lying in decisive cases of life. In crucial cases of life a lie can destroy relations and worsen situations rather than heal them. Moreover, the lying person himself may not endure the burdens of distortion and may suffer even more than the person who is being lied to.

Dear I would like to write to you about the new rule that is banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I am sure that the rule is absolutely outrageous. You should not accept that suggestion. As you know, mobile phones are indispensable in our everyday life. We could not even spend just one day without it in the modern world. I know that it is annoying when someone speaks on the phone in public spaces. However, that is because they need to do it at the time. Besides, people sometimes need to use the phone in case that they are in an emergency situation. In those cases, their life and death would depend on their phone. I must say that you could not decide whether or not a person has to die. As I have written above, it is a bad idea to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and so forth. Instead, you should just call on people to refrain from the use of mobile phones in some public spaces. Definitely, you should not ban it, as that is too much. This is why I wrote this letter. I hope that the other people who think about the ban would understand my opinion. I strongly believe it to be understood. Best regards, A citizen

I would like to say that it is basically the right thing to always tell the truth. It is very important, too. People must tell the truth all the time. However, I think that there could be a moment that is acceptable to tell a lie. For example, the time to tell a joke to friends. It would be funny, and people like funny things. It makes a relationship better. Likewise, there is a time, when you should not tell the truth. We have to think about the result before we say something. If we could be offensive or rude when we tell the truth, then we should refrain from telling the truth. Thus, we are able to be socially acceptable. By the way, how about telling a lie without any reasons? I suppose that that could not be right in any situation. To tell a lie is heinous. I am sure that most people agree with me about it. I would be disappointed if someone told a lie in a callous way. I think that it is very important not to tell any lies. What is more, it is also important to trust people around you every time you see them. This is my opinion but I would like to say that people should hate someone who has no qualm about telling a lie.

I see or I think everybody has to see that being healthy is better. Health has to be a priority of people even if you like to be rich or anything else. The more you care about your health the more you are wealthy. The person who is making money not money makes man so you have to focus on your health to be rich. Maybe you are rich and have a lot of money but you can't spend it because you are sitting in bed or you are in hospital and that refers to all the things you did in your health. You have to do exercise every day, at least three times a week, even it is 30 minutes, but you have to keep doing it. Everybody has to choose health first and if they choose money, I think after a little bit of time they will be sick.

It is really good to walk in the early morning because the wind is so clear and cold and it is also foggy. And I often go for a walk in the early morning during this season. It is from November to Feburary. There are many competitions that are held for students during this season. As I like challenges, it is really exciting for me. And our school is holding the awards ceremony in November. So it is the happiest time for outstanding students like me. And there is also my birthday in December. I am always surprised and happy on my birthday. And I always have a birthday party every year and it is really exciting to meet friends at the party and opening the gifts. It is the main reason why this season is so special for me. And we usually have many holidays during this season and it is fun to go somewhere during the holidays.

I myself have never worked in cubicles or in offices where there are no walls separating employees. I only know traditional enclosed workstations. Employees from one department sit together in these separated offices. From my experience the exchange between the employees is really good. They can share with each other all their experiences, knowledge and impressions during their work day. That works really well. One disadvantage is that it is difficult to meet people from other departments, except they have to work together because of a work topic. The knowledge exchange between the departments is really difficult. The risk here is that every department tries to push their goals even if it causes harm to another department. This is called Silo thinking. One departments tries to improve itself at the expense of another department. That would not be good for the whole company. Therefore, I like the idea with offices in which there are no walls, it seems to have a lot of advantages. As always in practice you have to be careful and to consider the company, corporate culture, region and people. It would make sense to involve the work council and the employees by planning such offices in order to get the best results for the employees, the company and the working atmosphere.

THE SCHOOL OF THE FUTURE: WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE? Many people are wondering what schools will be like in the future. I think that the school of the future will change in a lot of ways. The schools will be more technological than now, as the students will use computers, e-books, and online sites to study and they will do a lot of lessons and activities online. The schools will be different even in their aspect because I think that they will be bigger than now, and maybe the school's workers will be replaced by robots. In the school of the future there are things that will be the same, such as subjects like history, foreign languages, and others, because they are very important for the students. The schools maybe will not change a lot, but they will be different from now.

I think that in our era it is very common to read and study books on tablets and also on smartphones. In my opinion, it is almost the same thing. Books are heavy and need a space where you can put them, while on your computer you can read a lot of books and they don't take up a whole library. There are some bad aspects, like taking notes on your laptop. In my experience, it is difficult to write on digital books, more so if you try to write with a mouse. Some people are worried about the damage from the light produced by a screen. In fact, they have made some devices like Kindle that are made with the purpose of not bothering the eyes. The screen is lit from the side, in this way you can read for a long time and it doesn't hurt your eyes. You can also read in bed without turning on the light.

In my school days I had musician lessons. I didn't like the lessons and that was definitely not my favourite lesson. I remember that we had to sing and to read notes. I am not familiar with any musical instrument. But I think that students can assess and appreciate the knowledge which they will receive from these music lessons. Music belongs to general education and it has influence on further development. Music can stimulate our brain and has influence on our mood. Therefore it is really necessary to have an aware and basic knowledge. Nobody needs to be an expert in music. It should be done in such a way that up to a specific grade, you have to attend these music lessons. And then from a certain grade, you can opt out of the lessons. Every student can decide in regard to their interests which lessons they want to take. Students should determine their school life.

The truth is imperative. We must always tell the truth. This is not only a matter of choice, this is seriously deeper, it's something spiritual. Yes, okay, I understand that you cannot see what I am saying, however even if you could see it, you wouldn't choose it. Remember, when I said that choosing between the truth and a lie is something deeper and spiritual, I meant that if you decide to tell the truth you are choosing God otherwise when you make the opposite choice you are choosing Satan. I can't be clearer. I really know what you are thinking right now, and yes, I am a Christian, not a crazy one but an aware one and I am writing this down to make you aware of that. So if things are not completely clear for you now, I'll speak more openly that your life is not a simple combination of choices, it is much more, it is the outcome of your choices plus other people choices adding spiritual beings' actions and their choices. The Lord wants you and one of the ways to be closer to him is telling the truth even though this is not the only thing, it is (let's say) the beginning. As I said starting this "essay," the truth is imperative. The same way I can tell all of you God is the emperor.

Learning a foreign language is nowadays more important than ever before. Especially English as a global language is important in a business and private context. Globalization as a mega-trend has led to highly complex supply chains between companies. Today, companies purchase and sell their products on a global market to people and companies in every area in the world. All these transactions need to be negotiated and the language of negotiation is mostly English. As a result, most job advertisements are requiring fluent English skills from interested applicants. But fluent skills in a foreign language are also important for travelling the world. The chance to find someone in Asia who speaks German is much lower than finding someone who speaks English. To summarize, speaking a foreign language is more important than it was in the past. I would say, the more languages someone speaks, the better it is.

I think sleeping in the best situation is very important if you want rest. If you like to sleep in a dark and quiet room, that must be your goal every night. On the other hand, if you like to sleep in a bright room and you don't mind having a bit of noise in your room because you like to sense something, your goal must be that. Not all people have the same preference when they go to sleep, everyone has a different preference when they go to sleep. It's very important to know what are your preferences and something that we mustn't forget is the temperature of the room, everyone has their preference. Bye.

Dear Johnna, You have no idea where I went last Monday. To tell you the truth, I went to a music concert in the Baoli Giant Theatre, actually! March has witnessed a dramatic improvement in my career. The greatest of all was that I got promoted in my firm this term. Given that the former HR manager had resigned for good, I sought the opportunity just in time. You understand that people are likely to comfort themselves when they've just gone through a tough period, don't you? That accounted for why I was heading to the music concert. Frankly speaking, my knowledge of music is rather limited. To be honest, it was not until I got to the spot that I eventually learned whose concert it was, since the tickets were booked by my boyfriend in advance. Have you ever heard of Alica Frankle? Being one of the most distinguished divas in Britain, she is performing in the Globe this year. Overall, I regarded this concert as a more-than-fascinating one! Alica Frankle was not only a professional but also gifted in engaging people during the two-hour concert. I was at the edge of bursting into tears when she sang the Bridge of Shassas. It was really amazing! You will never forget about it once you hear her sing live. The concert is going to be a lifelong memory for me, definitely. Yours, Iris

Nowadays it is well known that many people are emigrating from small towns in rural areas to big cities. Therefore, we need more hospitals and doctors in the big cities for the reason that they have many patients to attend to. However, the citizens who live in the rural areas are old people and they need more health care. Owing to that fact, I believe that we should invest in those areas and as a result some citizens who have emigrated to big cities will have a chance to come back to their town. As a result the population in rural areas will increase and this will lead to the creation of new hospitals. In conclusion, there aren't enough doctors in rural areas due to their lack of population. For this reason I suggest that one of the best solutions could be to invest in those areas, so we can create new jobs and this will bring more citizens to those areas and eventually they will need more doctors.

The room itself should be rather dark because I easily wake up with bright sunlight.

Somehow the roaring sound of the motors make me very sleepy.

When people have the same teacher for several years they benefit from the fact that the teacher knows the students inside out and is able to see the study progress a student is making. In other words the teacher is able to monitor a student's growth for a longer period. Also, the teacher may relate to the students on a more personal level, enabling the teacher to understand a student in more depth. Aspects from a student's private life can more easily be understood by the teacher, through which he or she can empathize with the consequences, understand what is moving the student, and help the student to overcome any unforeseen difficulties caused by circumstances during his study. On the other hand, a fresh pair of eyes will help the student to grow further. New teachers can highlight points for improvement more easily because they do not know the background of the student. They are therefore able to pinpoint focus points more objectively. Each teacher brings along his or her special educational qualifications.

In my opinion, all students should be able to study music since this requires many skills and competences which will help them in their lives. First off, studying music is a great example of improving the creativity skills of students. Students will have to be creative while playing music. Creativity is one of those skills that will get them further in life while pursuing a career. This competency will help them to anticipate different situations under various circumstances. One other positive aspect of studying music is that it provides a way to express themselves in other ways than with words. As long as lecturers provide a safe environment in the classroom, students will be able to use music to show other students how they feel. Music can be used as way to express emotions. Furthermore playing music binds people together, whether it is during a jam session or whether it is when studying a musical play. It is very fulfilling to accomplish an enormous task such as a difficult music piece. Being able to work in a team will have an added value in the future. Therefore, I believe that all students should have access to musical studies.

There are many video games, varying from simple games such as Donkey Kong to advanced, complex video games, such as real life action movies. A part of these games aim at improving the child's fine motor movements, some are designed for educational purposes, and others are just for fun. The first two kinds of games certainly have positive effects on the children since they are especially focussing on improving skills in an entertaining way. This format helps kids to gain certain skills while playing. Teachers promote these games and use them as part of the educational programme. The last category can have a negative impact on children because children might get lost in the games which are based on current situations, quite often games where the goal is to win by shooting and killing avatars which resemble characters from their lives. On the other hand some of the more advanced games are designed in such a way that they have to cooperate with other kids to achieve their goals, so a learning element exists in those games. It certainly will help to set a strict age-limit for each game, preventing young kids to lose sight of reality and to avoid them getting hurt while playing those games.

Zoos are certainly good places for people to learn about animals. Today, an important task for zoos is to educate children on wildlife in general and the species living there in particular. In one of the Dutch zoos a young panda bear was born and the zoo kept viewers informed by setting up a live stream, enabling people to see how the panda was born and his experiences in the early weeks of his life, which would not be feasible under any other circumstances since people are not able to observe panda bears in the wild up close. This is just one example of the educational tasks of a zoo, they also provide information on plants and insects living in the wild by explaining in which climate they exist and how they survive. Nowadays, zoos take well care of animals and provide a safe environment. They duplicate the environment where the animals originate from as much as possible. Each area has all elements of the original natural environment; a variation of animals and plants and circumstances. If zoos did not exist, some animals would be extinct .

I have discovered that occasionally requesting input from students is the best course of action to design the school of the future. Indeed, it can be extremely beneficial to ask students directly what they think would be most effective, as this creates a democratic and egalitarian method of learning. Doing so can also enable youngsters to take a greater level of control of their own learning process, now and in the future. Amazingly, students know exactly what they prefer as method of learning and provide great ideas to improve the current education. A great leap forward would be to involve students in designing the school of the future. By putting them in charge of designing the best way of learning, they will experience a high level of personal involvement. I had the distinct pleasure of working with some brilliant, highly focussed students who provided a clear insight into what the school of the future should look like. The main and most important change to be made in education would be to put the students in control on their own study progress and goals, to assist them in their journey, encouraging them to go the extra mile, rather than forcing them to learn via the traditional path.

Most medical doctors, in order to earn more money, prefer to work in cities rather than work in a small rural places or small cities and because of that rural areas are facing medical problems and a lack of doctors. To solve this problem governments should make some statutes such as giving more money to those doctors who work in a rural area, which might encourage them and governments can decrease taxes on their salary . Moreover giving them some privileges in the country such as travelling cheaper than other citizens might be a nice privilege for those doctors, because many rural areas or villages are away from cities and travelling might have a high price. Besides these rural areas should be developed by governments to encourage doctors to live there, for example founding some sport stuff like swimming pools, tennis and football fields. These solutions could be helpful for doctors to spend their leisure time, who have no claim to work in a village or a rural place. So if doctors desire more money to work, increasing their salaries might be a solution besides other privileges.

Languages are the means through which people can communicate with each other. Learning is the thing that everybody has to own and always be update their knowledge. Learning new languages besides being beneficial is one of the important things in the world because it is never old fashioned, it will always have its place. you are proud of yourself and break new ground. The more you learn the more you keep digging into your knowledge. So it will never be old. Language is dying when all of the people who speak it die. There is a wonderful quote from Nelson Mandela that said “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.” I think everybody has to learn at least a new language besides his native language. That opens a lot of new opportunities for him. He can also travel to the country where people speak it.

Dear Jason, Glad to hear from you so soon! Excited that a movie festival is to be held in your campus, I literally have a fascinating one to suggest: The Social Network. As is widely known, the movie was adapted from a storyline about Mark Zuckerburg and the process of how he and his friends created Facebook. Just like other adaptive films, TSN did a good job in keeping the balance between drama and reality. That is to say, you can see the traditional American style of films, which is filled with sex, conflicts, as well as a strict plot. At the same time, there also stood the reflections of what had happened to the characters in reality. What I found most thrilling when watching the movie was the engrossing acting by two male actors, Jesse and Andrew. As for Jesse, who acted as Mark in TSN, he never failed to attract the whole audience with his high-speed lines as well as delicate facial expressions. I almost cried out "That's Zuckerburg alive" when he typed in an incredibly fast rhythm on the keyboard. Needless to say, Andrew was the one who dedicated his heart and soul to his character Edurado. Playing Mark's best friend, Edurado had gone through a series of tough times when they started their career. Notwithstanding, Andrew's Edurado was a "sweetheart" from head to toe, as he's always there for his mate. Released almost ten years ago, TSN was a phenomenal blockbuster as well as a box-office hit. It's the kind of film that you surely don't want to miss. That's why I highly recommend it to you. I sincerely hope you can enjoy it. Yours, Iris

I think that it is better to live on their own when they are attending school. Generally, most students live at home with their family and depend on them about living things. It is not bad for students, however living by themselves will give them advantages in the future. I have two points about my idea. First of all, living by ourselves develops our living skills. There are many things to life, like washing, cooking, cleaning and so on. Then, at home, we probably rely on our families, especially our mothers. But, if we live by ourselves, no one does them without us. And, most of the students will go out of their home and live alone when they begin working in society. So, living on their own while they are students will be preparation for their future lives. Secondly, students can make time to do something efficiently better than living at home with their families. For example, at home, when we want to go to the bathroom, if another family member already has done so, we have to wait for them to finish. This may be a little thing in a daily life, but it also breaks our plan in the day. If we live alone, we can decide when we go to the bathroom and it makes it easier to make a plan in a day. While we are students, there many things to do such as studying, working part-time and so on. So, in order to use time flexibly, living alone is very effective for students. All in all, I described two points about preparation for the future and using time effectively. Living by ourselves while we are students is so difficult and hard. But, it will have a good effect on us definitely.

My experience with Write and Improve. I started using it 1 month ago, more or less, and I have to say that I believe that it is a quite useful tool to improve my writing skills. One of my favourite things about this page is that it has many different types of writing to choose from, for instance, you can write an informal letter and then a formal essay. Besides, I find the variety of levels that the website provides quite helpful. Within the website you can find the following levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, I'm not so happy with the automatic corrector, for the reason that sometimes it can misunderstand some of your words. In conclusion, as I see it Write and Improve is a wonderful tool if you want to train your writing skills and therefore I would recommend it to everyone who wants to acquire a better English.

After having done some body exercises with my class, I am getting used to the idea that this is one of the best way to keep our body in shape and in good health. Even if the time you spend is time doing body exercises, you are supposed to improve not only your physical health but also the mental health. Some of them are aimed at strengthening your upper limbs, others are perfect for the legs or back. The variety of exercises is quite large and most of them come from the U. S., however, some American research studies have shown that a body exercise-based lifestyle, is not the only way to take care of our health. What the statistics suggest to us is that we should keep track of our food habits. All of us should eat a great deal of fruit and vegetables as a way to avoid breathing difficulties or blood pressure problems. Some rubbish food we are used to eating is nowhere near as near as genuine as we are recommend to do. Just let me be a little ironic: every rubbish food restaurant should be cordoned off, not one car should pull over towards them.

I would like to live a long, calm life, definitely. It would be better rather than having a shorter life, even if that would be much more intense. I would like to explain the reasons why I think so. First of all, I like a tranquil life very much. I always tend to avoid noisy places because of that. Generally, I do not like to talk to people. If anything, I would prefer to read books or something like that. Although I like to listen to people who are talking. Besides, a long life would give me more opportunities to get various experiences. I have a lot of things that I would like to do. To do so, I must live for as long a time as possible. If you do not have much time to live, then what could you achieve in such a short time? However, in spite of what I wrote above, I agree that the intensity is important to some extent. Even if I could live for a long time, it would be boring when I could not do anything. It is reasonable that some people do not hesitate to do dangerous things, because they want to do so. On balance, I could not say which is better. But I would just choose a long life. Not to mention, a long, intense life would be the best.

That is an interesting question. Personally, I can sleep in any situation. For instance, before I became a mother I was sleeping in a dark and quiet room, but since I became a mother I cannot sleep in a dark room because sometimes my daughter wakes up during the night and she cries because she is scared. As a result of that, I turn on a small light in the room because that helps my daughter to be more reassured.

Some people argue that students should not have to study music in school. However, I'm against that idea for some reasons. First of all, it is undeniable that music is an effective way of entertainment. As far as I'm concerned, nowadays students have to learn a huge amount of knowledge with loads of academic subjects. That leads to their high study pressure and overwhelming by trillion of theories in many areas. Therefore, if there are music classes in their schedule, it will reduce students's stress and make their brain less tense. Music is proved to have some health benefits including enhancing the memory and ability to concentrate. Moreover, the soft melody created by musical instruments can help them to calm down, soothe their soul. It tends to decrease the risk of conflicts between irritated students. Music also develops students' artistic talents. By learning to play musical instruments, their sense of art is more subtle and delicate. Coincidentally, it improves the right brain of learners. As a result, students can become more creative and be interested in artistic areas. For students that have talent in music at the beginning, they maybe gain some useful experience and soon will be experts in their pursuit of a music career. For the rest, it's likely some of them will find out their passion for music. Then, they direct their action to become musicians, instrumentalists or even singers. From the above benefits of music, I think that this subject should be taught at school. It can make a significant change in students' life.

In many less populated areas, there is a lack of doctors as a huge number of them are moving to cities. Most medical doctors want to move to town because there are more opportunities to find a stable job such as nurse and other hospital workplaces. Indeed, in urban areas there are more places to work, because health centres in metropolis are bigger than the countryside health centres. Furthermore in populated zones, for some kinds of doctors such as physicians, psychologists and dentists, it is easier to find clients because they work in areas that are more populated and where there is a greater density of people. For instance, a dentist who works in the city has more opportunity to have a regular client rather than a rural medic. To resolve these problems, small towns and counties should try to search for more volunteers like medical students to work in their infirmary. Being a clinician in a big town is easier, but is important to have more doctors in rural areas.

Hi John! How are you? I hope that everything is fine! Last week I was quite bored for the reason that I hadn't had class. However, Jenny told me that on Friday in Barcelona a new band was going to perform their first concert, so we decided to go. And to my surprise it was awesome! Besides, in the time between songs they did stunts! The band is called the LikeWike and they mostly play rock. Therefore I would recommend you listen to them, since I know that you're a huge fan of rock. I thought that if you enjoy their music we could go together to their next performance. Take care! Roger

Hi Matt, Yes, I'm not very good at English and I want to improve it. So, I've been trying to improve my English skills. I'm doing many things. I'll tell you some.

There is no doubt that these days taking a rest from a job and daily work is very important for our bodies. There is some important information almost all people need to know before going on a holiday, such as the place , location, activities, and accommodation. All of these things are important to have a good holiday. However, in this essay, I am going to write about my experience in the United States. When I got my scholarship from my government I decided to go to the United States for three main reasons. The first reason was that there are many states and we can try many things at the same time as we study. Moreover, the weather there is different from state to state , so you have many choices to decide which place you want to go for your holiday. Additionally to the place that we chose to visit, we saw many beautiful places that I had not ever seen. For example, I visited Georgia, Florida, and Washington DC. In these states I went to many cities such as Athens, Atlanta, and Helin. Moreover, in Florida I went to Gainsaville , Tampa, and Orlando. In conclusion, I had a great holiday in the United States.

In my opinion, I think exercise is important to everyone, but not just exercise is important, it is important to eat healthy food, always drink water, eat fruit, and the most important, do exercise every day. Nowadays, there are fat people, but if you are fat, it does not mean you are not healthy. Beauty is not thin people, independent of your body, you need to feel good about yourself, don't care about other opinions about your body or what kind of clothes you use, think just about you and your health. However, some people do not do exercise, but just eat healthy foods, and feel very healthy. It is about that, feeling healthy, and not following a standard of beauty imposed by society. Be yourself every day. The best thing is to take care of yourself, and do exercise which does not need to be boring. It can be fun to ride a bicycle, rollerblade, skate, or go to the swimming pool, etc.

Health is more important than wealth It is a known proverb that "health is wealth." We know human progress has been changing and it will continue, but sayings and proverbs do not change. We must say that health is the greatest wealth. In other words, we can enjoy our money and property when we are healthy. A sick person is not able to enjoy his wealth in a proper way, he needs a healthy body to be happy. We have wealthy and poor countries around the world. When we see a "happiness index" it doesn't say that only wealthy countries are happier. In fact, a poor country like Bhutan has the number one place in the happiness index, its people are happier than other countries and its people. Bhutan has not a proper government, but Bhutan has a king and its kingdom governs the country. Similarly, we can look at rural and urban areas of a country in general. And we find that people in the villages are healthier than those who are living in cities. And cities provide a lot more facilities to its people. The information above says that health is more important than wealth for a happy and prosperous life.

Nowadays, people argue about the importance of good health compared to being rich. In my view, I suppose that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Firstly, good health is considered as the most valuable treasure of each person. When you are healthy, you have loads of energy to do anything you want. You can climb up steep mountains, run fast in windy hills, and do some extreme sports without being limited. Moreover, with good health, you will work productively. A strong farmer can do twice as much as a weak one. Similarly, a white-collar worker who does exercise every day is able to work overtime and usually active in their work. Sadly, some people are over-confident about their strength and then make full use of it to earn a living. They maybe become a millionaire, but in the long run, they will pay a heavy toll with their health. The money they earned will be used for paying the hospital bill instead of travelling all around the world and spending time with family members. In conclusion, I put health first and invest in my health for further benefits in the future.

Computers and tablets should not fully replace books in schools and universities. Books are a unique source of education and knowledge in schools and universities. Those institutions are colourless without books. To imagine students without books is impossible. Books are the original source of our classics and literature that has given humans a lot. Books are as important as computers and tablets are for us. We can use them for different places and purposes, neither can completely replace one another. It is like someone can manage his work with one hand and he should eliminate the other hand. Just like we need various types of vehicles to travel, and everything has its importance in life. Books are possible to be produced at less amount at a large number. And books can be bought and replaced, simply by spending a few dollars. To expect the same cost and price for computers and tablets is not possible, many people cannot afford them. We have many countries now that are not able to provide books to its people properly. They are not in a place to replace books with computers and tablets.

The statement for today is: it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. And I think that is definitely true. My health is very important for me. I can't be rich if I don't have a job. And I can't have a job if I am not healthy enough. Unless you have a rich dad and he gives you everything you want. But my dad isn't rich. I have to work to become rich. And if you want to work, so you can become rich, you have to have good health. Otherwise your boss won't hire you. I think that when you are healthy, you are also happier. At least I am, and I hope you are too. Money isn't the most important thing when you are healthy and you have friends and family. A person who isn't rich, can be happy too. Because for most people their health and their family and friends are the most important things they have!

It's a common belief that learning to speak a foreign language has a positive impact on our life. And I think that it's more crucial in the 4.0 industry than it was in the past. Firstly, learning foreign languages will meet the great demand for communication of people. We are living in the modern world where people easily interact with others across continents thanks to the invention of the Internet in 1969. Besides, the need for travelling and trading is one of the reasons that bring people together. So, learning new languages helps people whose cultures are different easily understand each other. In that way, it is more and more necessary than in the past when people couldn't afford to travel or exchange things with foreigners. Moreover, today we have a new notion, global citizens; it is the idea that one's identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership of a broader class: "humanity." Therefore, the priority is that they have the ability to speak more than two languages. Then, they can do their work and make a contribution to the development of their countries. Today, English is considered as a global language and Chinese is the most spoken language in the world. So, it's likely be your strength if you learn either of them.

Nowadays, it is well known that computers and tablets are gaining popularity among students and teachers. However, I'm one of those who believe that we shouldn't remove books. I agree that computers have many perks, for instance, with them we can search for information with just a few clicks, and the sources of information we have on the internet are almost endless. Nevertheless, these perks can be disadvantages at the same time. It has been shown that computers and tablets can reduce our capacity of attention, for example, many students usually spend most of their time on social applications, such as Facebook and Instagram. Due to this I think that books are still useful for students because with them we are normally more focused and therefore we can learn more. I have to say that in some lessons the In conclusion, even though I believe that computers are vital for schools and universities, we should keep using books for some lessons.

Studying abroad has advantages as well as disadvantages. The main advantage is that students have the opportunity of exploring other cultures while pursuing their studies abroad. Learning about other cultures is a real plus in today's multicultural society. This will with no doubt be a big advantage during their future careers. They will learn about cultural backgrounds and differences and will learn how to relate to other cultures, certainly skills they wouldn't have been able to develop while studying in their own country. Another advantage is that if a student decides that studying abroad is an option, then multiple qualified universities and available degree programmes are available to choose from. Studying in a foreign country will also be a big asset on their resume. The biggest disadvantage is that while focussing on their studies the students will also have to take care of their own household, while living in a foreign country at the same time, not aware of the cultural differences, which might cause problems, and probably being unable to make themselves understood because they do not master the foreign language yet. Studying abroad will, if you are not eligible for a grant, be far more expensive than studying at home. Several types of grants are available to students and it might be worthwhile to explore the possibilities before deciding in which country you want to continue your studies. Living in another country makes it also more difficult to find a suitable part-time job to support yourself during your studies.

First of all, studying is one of the best things if you go to a country that has a good education. Let me talk about the advantages. You will get a wonderful education and you will choose what you want to study. I mean there is not a degree that will limit your college or high school study. You will see a new country, place, culture, and things that you have never seen before. New friends. You will meet mates, you will have new friendships. The disadvantages will be that you are in a different country and there are a lot of things new to you and maybe you will not like it, but you have to deal with it. If you are sick one day, you will be alone without anyone of your family and that is the worst situation. The fee of studying maybe will be expensive, so you have to decide before you travel to any country and make your plan. The bottom line is that studying abroad is good if you have money and a plan to where, which you will choose.

Many workplaces are enormous and they don't have any kind of barrier in them. Other offices instead are small places for work, with barriers and without communication among workers. In my opinion, big offices are more effective than small offices because you have more possibility to communicate with other people. Workplaces with an open design are better for coworking as you can communicate with your team. NA,. you can ask someone for advice and you can share your point of view about the work you are doing with your colleagues. For instance, if you are wondering about a thing in your work, you can ask someone for help. In addition, big workrooms are places where you can know more people that are inspirational for you, and they could help you, giving you some advice. Big workplaces are better because you have more possibility to work with other people and to exchange ideas.

Some students, to obtain their degree, have to do a certain number of hours of volunteer work. I think that this requirement is crucial for students, as, for them, it is a first approach to the world of work. For instance if a student is confused about his future, with volunteer work he can understand which is the best way for him . In addition, volunteer work is an important experience to do because students show and demonstrate if they are ready to do a real job. Indeed, with these hours of practice, schools understand if they are ready to graduate or not. For example if a student does not complete the hours of volunteer work at school, it means that he is not ready for the degree. Volunteer work is important for students as a first approach to real job and it is also a good experience to clarify ideas about work.

Recently, some things have already been changing. The way to teach is different from the way when I was a child. We are living in a multicultural society, so everybody has the same opportunities to learn everything about their original religion. This is the reason why we can overhear people talking in different languages. It won't be a problem in the future. We may use a small device fit in our ear to translate all conversations. Furthermore, we will have a micro-chip inside our skin and our parents or teachers will be able to know where we are. In the future, the most popular language will be Chinese. Therefore, if you want to learn a new language, you should start with it. I'm sure the classes in the future will be mainly online. Nowadays we are living a lockdown period and we are learning how we can work from our house. The way to teach in the future will also change. Pupils will study at home, watching videos and video-conferences and giving their opinions about them. I don't know if we will be better.

Some programs require knowledge about different subjects. For instance, "Pasapalabra." It is a competition to win lots of money. However, the participants must study a lot if they want to win the quiz. They have to discover a word through a definition and a clue: its first letter. I think it is very useful and educational like the 'Wheel of Fortune'. You can also learn to cook or sew a garment. Nevertheless, there are some programs which, in my opinion, are rubbish. That kind of programs is showing how a couple plays with their relationship. Many people are watching them. However, I think this type of program isn't educational. You may watch a film or series about the history of a country, so you can learn a lot, or you will be able to watch a crime film with a lot of violence and blood. We need to look after our children.

So you probably remember that my favourite Disney film is the Hunchback of the Notre-Dame, since I might have repeated that way too much the last time we spoke. I think you should really watch it, because it is extremely awesome. For one, the songs just hit you right where it hurts. I cry almost every time I hear 'Heaven's Light' and I get overly dramatic when I hear and sing along to 'Hellfire'. Another point is that the characters are very well rounded. They show real human emotions such as love, lust, and envy. And even though Quasi might be in love with Esmeralda, he also sees that she is in love with Phebus, and he with her, so he leaves them be even though it breaks his heart to see them together.

Last summer, I had the distinct pleasure of spending time in Italy and looking back, I reckon it turned out to be the best holiday ever. Since Italy is a 1600-km drive, we always spend the night near Lake Lugano. Luckily for us there was still a room available at one of our favorite hotels, where we enjoyed the top-quality service of this very charming, yet very traditional hotel, commonly known for its famous visitors like Audrey Hepburn. The second day, we arrived at the camping in Tuscany. The sun was shining and the temperature already had risen to a very comfortable 30 degrees. Unpacking was done very quickly so that we could settle in the sun and start planning our sightseeing tours in the surroundings. One of the highlights was the visit to the waterfall in the beautiful rural neighbourhood of Florence. We walked alongside the waterfall and were very much impressed by the amazing nature; all kinds of plants were flourishing and the colours of the flowers were brilliant for taking photos. The other unforgettable moment was our visit to Cita del la Pieva, an ancient village with stunning views. We loved walking along the small streets, enjoyed the best espresso ever on one of the small, romantic squares while thinking about other things to be discovered in this very romantic village.

Dear Mollet del Valles council, I am writing you regarding the news about banning the use of mobile phones in some spaces, I disagree with this new proposal. First of all for the reason that I believe we should have the freedom to decide if we want to use our mobile phones in shops or restaurants, therefore it isn't a matter that the council can decide for us. Secondly, due to the fact that nowadays many people need their mobile phones for their work. For instance, let's imagine that someone who works as a stock broker goes out to have lunch at a restaurant, however he is not allowed to use his mobile phone while he is eating and suddenly one of his stocks goes abruptly down. He wouldn't notice it because he didn't have his phone and now he has lost a lot of money. Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion: The council could create advertisements in order to warn the citizens about the disadvantages of mobile addictions. As I see it, it is a less aggressive action, which gives freedom to the citizens to choose. In conclusion, it is true that we spend too much time in front of our electronic devices, nevertheless we should have the liberty to choose if that is how we want to spend our time or not. Even though the council could.

Dear Makenzie, How are you? I went to a music concert last week, and it was really great, so I couldn't wait to share my experience with you. You know me well, so you know that I love music because music can make me feel relaxed. I had a really hard time last week due to the many exams I had to take. As a consequence, I decided to go to a music concert to relax. Another reason I went to the concert was that I love playing the piano, and this concert was performed by a young pianist from Germany. A pianist from Germany was performing. I couldn't spell his name because it was too long and complicated. Nevertheless, I could recognize him among people, because he looked very handsome and tall, and he was very elegant. Perhaps it was the classical music that made him so gorgeous. He was also very polite. He greeted me outside the theatre when I was waving my hand excitedly when seeing him. I really enjoyed the music during the concert, but there was something annoying. Many people were late for the concert, so there were many figures moving to find seats while I was listening to the first piece of music. What's more, there were some kids in the theater. Maybe that was because their parents want them to get to know more about classical music. Nevertheless, the kids could hardly know about classical music, and they couldn't understand the meaning of the music. It was really tough for them to sit on their chair for over two hours without screaming and crying. This made the experience not very comfortable. I don't really think we should allow children under 10 years old to enter a concert, because they may ruin a precious journey with music. I also think we shouldn't allow people who are late to enter a concert. They have to take responsibility for not being punctual. What do you think about my thoughts? Although many unexpected things happened, I was still satisfied with this concert. I definitely appreciated the performance. The pianist was quite technical and talented. I hope that I can play the piano as well as he did in the future. I hope everything is going well with you, and I hope we can go to a concert together when I go to the USA next year. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, Joany

I think the school of the future will be fairly different from the schools we have today. Most of the time students will take their own track to learn something new. Teachers will work to show a pathway to students and make sure they don't get lost. Maybe the students will work with specific topics, for instance, if a student has a gift to work with exact sciences he will focus on it. And over time, this student acquires specific knowledge of a given subject. I think some courses would disappear and others will emerge, like coding and other topics related to computers, such as artificial intelligence as well. Some things won't change, for example, interaction between children. They need to develop their social skills or soft skills. And human contact is essential for the children to develop it. I hope that children in the future will become better human beings than we are now.

Hi Billal, Last week me and our classmates went to Kyoto on a short trip. As you know, there are many historical and valuable buildings in Kyoto. So, we went to famous tourist spots such as Kiyomizu temple and Kinkakuji temple. For some people among us, it was the first time we went to Kyoto, it was a great opportunity to go there. We could feel and enjoy the traditional Japanese atmosphere. So, I hope you also have a chance to go to Kyoto. Regards,

It is a good idea to study abroad during high school or university'cause it will help in your career. Learning a new language, discovering a new culture, studying, and studying new things in another country is awesome for your curriculum. The advantage for those who study abroad is they meet new people that have other cultures, which helps them a lot, depending on the career they will follow. If you want to be a flight attendant, it is good for you. The disadvantage of studying abroad is that it will hinder the progress of your academic life in your country of origin. When you get back, sometimes you need to study more to arrive at the level of your other colleagues. The most thing in your life is studying abroad. It is very expensive, but it's really worth it. The experience is the best in the world, and everyone should have the opportunity to study abroad.

I firmly believe that living in a separate house in your young days triggers your new life, which you appreciate in the future. This idea is held up by my past experiences. In the adolescent period, to be emotionally stable, young college students build a firm network that they want to belong to instead of relying on their parents all the time. This sense of belonging accelerates their mental growth because they play a role in their community aside from a child. They will be mentally independent and responsible not for their lives but also their communities. In my case, I stayed in a student dorm and interacted with a lot of colleagues in different majors. This whole experience made me who I am. Said that, some people still stress that living at home is cost-efficient and comfortable to focus on the studies. I would oppose this idea for two reasons. One is that it is true you save your money if you can go to university from your parents’ house but is the cheaper cost the true reason why you wanted to attend the university? Apparently you may go though more hardships than you imagined, yet these challenges you encounter would be a medicine to intensify your growth. The younger you are, the better it is to go through a variety of experiences. The second reason is that if you cannot manage your time by yourself without any family support, you will suffer a new life after working in a company. To grow yourself, you should stand your own two feet even from the college days.

The Future of Travel changed with the arrival of the COVID19 virus and the challenge facing us with regard to the environment. More than ever, people were faced with the most challenging and only question regarding travelling ever: is it a luxury just for the rich people or a common thing which ordinary people can enjoy as well? COVID19 prohibited people from travelling beyond borders. All kinds of belts and braces were put in place to keep people at home. Crossing borders was not allowed during the outbreak of the virus. Moreover, it had been forbidden by national governments to prevent the virus from spreading unnecessarily any further than it already did. Travelling was only possible within the frontiers of the country. So maybe, the future of travel is not getting onto a plane for a far-away vacation, experiencing other cultures and nature, but staying close to home, exploring the neighbourhood and revisiting all the little gems in the local area surrounding us. The future will tell if people will ever be able to travel long distance again or that it will be forbidden for ever. Ultimately, less travelling will have a beneficial effect on nature , because travelling in itself will be burdening and have a major impact on the environment. So maybe the limitations set by the virus will in the end have a positive effect on people as well as on the environment.

Nowadays it takes a lot of effort and money to successfully run a medical practice, especially in these competitive times. Since the insurance companies play an important role in setting rules for medical practices, it becomes more and more difficult for a medical doctor to run his business at a profit. The insurance companies setting strict rules, prevent medical doctors being creative in treating their patients in the best way they know how. Each treatment has its own set of limitations as to what a medical doctor may offer in a certain amount of time. And in the end, it is all about business. Rural areas often represent a particular low number of habitants, whereas medical practices need as many patients are possible, enforcing medical doctors to set up their practice in large cities instead of small villages. Moreover, a small village, however charmingly picturesque and attractive, does not offer enough patients and are in such a way extremely challenging to entrepreneurs who in general want to develop a successful business. Once in a while, you will still find a lonesome medical doctor, stuck away in a little village, using old-fashioned ways to help his patients, thus taking all the time needed to comfort the patient, but these become more and more a rarity in today's society and are becoming extinct.

Young medical doctors who are starting in the profession prefer to work in the big cities to make a lot of money, as starting and they want to earn money, when these doctors grow in the profession and stay stabilized, they come to rural areas. It is easier to find a job in the big cities than in rural areas, that is the reason why the young doctors prefer cities. Old doctors prefer working in the rural areas, because they are stabilized and they have a good career. Young doctors need to do networking with other doctors, and the big cities are the best place to do so, in rural areas they have more difficulty in networking with doctors. It is a big problem some doctors have in rural areas, because the hospitals need so many doctors in all the places, and do not concentrate on the big cities. We need doctors, sometimes we have an emergency and need doctors.

My favorite season of the year. If there were a possibility, I would create a new season. The season of fun! Well, maybe next time. Exquisite things are happening during the year. Although there is one season I like particularly, autumn. Why, you may ask? Autumn represents a new academic year. I am always excited about it. My life is all about learning new things. Equally relevant to this is that chilly weather allows me to easily focus. As you may notice during the hot peaks in summer, studying is not the best option. I loathe warm countries. Sweating and stinking is definitely unpleasant for me. Autumn is the best time to travel. Flight tickets are much cheaper. The weather makes it easier to walk long distances on an adventure. And last but not least, autumn is special to me because of my birthday on the 17th of November. All I do that day is being with people I love the most.

Dear Lily, I haven't written a letter to you in a long time. I hope you are doing well and are having a nice weekend. Firstly, I was very sorry when I didn't contact you. I have had mid-term exams for two weeks, so I have been really busy. As you know, I am a final-year student, so I need to try my best to keep and achieve good results to prepare for my future. I want to find a good job after I graduate from university. So I hope you can forgive me. Today is Saturday, so I have free time after the stressful exam time. I went to the cinema and watched the movie "KONG Island' Do you know or have you watched the film? I think you like the type of film. It is a movie about KONG with many modern techniques. I knew that the movie was filmed in Ninh Binh, Vietnam. And Ninh Binh is my hometown. It is a very beautiful place and it is one of the famous touristic places in Vietnam. Most foreign tourists go to Ninh Binh when they come to Vietnam. I also hope after the Covid pandemic ends, you can come to Vietnam and Ninh Binh. I will be very happy when I can meet you. The film is about the survival of Kong on Skull Island, how Kong fights against human intrusion. The content is quite simple, but it is extremely meaningful. I think you should go to see it if you have any time. In the end, I miss you very much and look forward to hearing from you about your internship at Columbia University. I hope you have a good time and experience at this time. And please take good care of yourself during the Covid pandemic. Best luck to you and waiting for your next letter. Sincerely,

In recent years, there has been a heated debate on whether college students should be forced to physical activities due to the fact that because of the heavy effects of modernization and industrialization, it is increasingly hard for them to keep a reasonable balance between stressful schoolwork and physical and psychological wellbeing. While some hold a firm belief that it is doubtless for schoolchildren, who may be too busy to distribute some of their time and energy to physical exertion, I, to a large extent, maintain that only by taking regular exercise, be it jogging or swimming, can students enjoy a precious opportunity to pursue more a rounded development as well as enhanced academic performances. In this essay, I would like to quote a few examples to support my opinion. To begin with, generally speaking, exercising can absolutely release ourselves from feeling stressed and suffocated, which caters for both our physical needs and psychological pursuits. What I mean by this is that under so many fierce competitions both on and off campus, it is rather important to keep fit to ensure the success of our academic grades, which benefits us undoubtedly and offers us valuable opportunities, enlarging our merits and edges over other candidates for further would-be competitions. Therefore, it is of great necessity to guarantee our exercise on a daily basis. Why not start from now! In addition, in many cases, as is known to all, making ends meet has been increasingly difficult for adults, especially when the entire world has been suffering from financial recession brought about by the COVID-19 for an extended period of time. It therefore seems more essential to every individual, scholars in particular, to be in decent health only physically but also mentally to prevent them from being bombarded by bills of different operational costs and daily consumption accordingly. As an old saying goes, “Health ensures the success of the revolution”, for which plenty of evidence can be found. To sum up, while tertiary education is allowed to enact and enforce a number of specific regulations about exercising, including compulsory PE classes, which might seem to be a bit cruel somehow, I am still convinced that it is our capability and responsibility to follow them, as they could make us more effective and efficient. Ideally, university students ought to start to move about and stay away from an inactive lifestyle.

Dear M. S. Nada, First of all, thank you for your discussion, it was really helpful. Taking care of yourself is very important because if you have any health problem you will be not able to eat or drink well and live your life to the fullest. In my opinion, it is more important to be healthy than to be rich because if you are in bad health you can not work or study or develop. To be healthy, I am going to tell you the steps to be healthy. Firstly, eat healthy food. This means eat good food, including the triangle of carbohydrates, vitamins , fats, minerals, and meat. Secondly, make sure to sleep well, between 6 and 8 hours. After that, do exercise. Finally, to be healthy it is really important to become rich.

Taking care of your health is very important. Your health is precious and no one can help you with that if you don't look after yourself. I mean, to have a balanced diet and to eat sensibly and do exercise. Listen to your body because it leads you to have the best result in your life. I totally agree with the fact that it is more important to be healthy than rich because I believe that it does not matter to be rich in life, there are many things more necessary than being rich. If you have good health you are one of the luckiest people in the world that they need someone to pay for them to sygries like they eyes. Also think about how your life would be if you were rich but ill, you would not be happy, right? Yes, in fact all happiness comes from good health.

The question if to be healthy or to be rich is sure. It is very important to be healthy. When you are healthy money is very important because you need some life, a nice house or flat, you may want to have children, etc. Money is the only means for a better life. Our life or health is a natural thing in our lives. Two years ago, I had some moment when I found out that only one thing and everything is away. We have to protect our health. We can try to suggest that we have money but we do not have health. What is it? I think that we are feeling a bad feeling. I have had everything and I still have to take it.

It is well known that television entertains, but there are doubts as to whether television educates or not. On the one hand we use the television to have fun, relax, and entertain in different ways and we spend a lot of time in front of it. On the other hand, education experts have been trying to solve this question for a very long time, does television educate? I'm not totally sure about it, but I know I have been watching television to learn things for a long time. There are lots of educational channels available for a wide range of ages, from 1 to 99 years old. The major problem is most of the time people don't use the television as they should do. Mostly children and teenagers, they need to be supervised while they watch television as part of an educational program. Even adults have to deal with the desire to watch entertainment programs on television, rather than an educational program. In short, I think people can use the television for educational purposes.

Nowadays, a lot of students are getting unhealthy because of their inactive lifestyle. That makes some people say all students at school or university should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. In my opinion, I think their thought is reasonable and I will use this passage to explain why. There are several reasons for my opinion. To begin with the most important one, from the research of Cambridge University those students who have sports activities daily can actually have a brighter future than the others. It is very easy to understand their research, those people who have daily sports not only have a healthy body, but also have a spirit of never giving up,which means they will have more chances in their future than others. Secondly, there are two kinds of students: those people who like sports and those people who don't like sports. For the first type, their schools or universities don't need to force them do weekly sports activities. But for another type, it is necessary for their schools and universities to force them do weekly sports activities. Because if their schools or universities not force them, they will never do some sports activities, which can cause a bad influence in their health. Last but not least, doing sports activities can bring us a lot of positive effects. On one hand, doing daily sports activities can make us healthier. On the other hand, it can also help us have a wonderful social life. For example, you can make a lot of new friends when you are having sports activities, which can make you a better personality. By the way, when you are doing sports activities, you can gain lots of precious memories that you can recall someday in the future. To summarize, students should have daily sports activities. Our schools or universities should force their students if it is necessary.

There is a question of our behavior to our own life, would you prefer a long calm life or a short intense life? Everyone has their own answer for this question. In my opinion, a short intense life is better than a long and calm life. There are several reasons for my opinion. To begin with the most important one, from research by Cambridge University, those people who have an intense life actually can have a better life than the others. They explain it with a theory, the personality of those people who have an intense life are more positive, they know what to do when something suddenly happens. Secondly, from my point of view, a long calm life means a boring life. But life should be exciting, which means people are wasting their life if they spend every day doing the same thing. By the way, although those people who have a calm life can live a long life, when they're old they won't have anything to recall. Last but not least, an intense life maybe is short, but it will make you feel refreshed every day. For example, you can make new friends every day or experience new adventures normally. If you have an intense life, on one hand, you can fill your own life with a lot of valuable memories. On the other hand, when you are old there will be lots of things for you to recall. To summarize, an intense life is better than a calm life, even if an intense life is always short.

During holidays or at the weekend, an outing to the zoo is always welcomed. But are zoos suitable places for the animals kept inside? Wouldn't it be smarter and wiser to leave them in nature? I would say it depends. Indeed, nowadays wildlife is increasingly threatened. The main reasons for the dramatic plummet of the different types of animals on Earth are poaching, mass breeding, trafficking, and destruction of the ecosystems . But the list is far from being complete, and wildlife today has nothing to do with the variety we could have observed 50 to 100 years ago. And that's where zoos can act - in a good way. By providing the animals with a living environment, obviously much smaller than the one they would have had in wild nature, but much safer for them and their offspring, zoos are helping to preserve a wide variety of fauna. Therefore, zoos can be an excellent way to preserve wildlife. Besides, by showing them to the public, everyone can learn about them and be made aware of their protection. As long as the world will stay as it is currently, there's no way we could return those animals to nature. It is true that they belong to a wild environment, but nature is no longer safe enough for them, whatever the ecologists who would like them to be released say - and they would therefore be delivered to human madness and to death.

In this modern society, the rate of chronic patients gradually increases every year, which means there are more and more unhealthy humans. Why does this situation happen? It can be attributed to an irregular daily routine and sleep schedule. According to the investigation, the data demonstrated that office workers are under a lot of pressure at work, and in their leisure time, they prefer to veg out in front of the TV rather than do exercise. It is a malignant cycle; therefore, more and more scientists promote exercise which can help you be in shape and healthy. In my viewpoint, I concur to force students to participate in PE classes. First, healthy habits should be cultivated in childhood. Schools can teach students correct concepts about diet and sport. This type of knowledge can be applied in their whole life. Consequently, when growing up, they understand how to take care of themselves and maintain a regular daily routine. When entering late adulthood, they can prevent severe diseases and enjoy a jubilant retirement. Second, the purpose of having sports activities is not only health but also a sound development of the body. When doing exercise, individuals ought to acquire how to control perfectly their bodies to meet the standard. This is extremely significant for children, for they are supposed to learn the rules of each item, which can enhance the development of the brain. Finally, having PE classes can help students experience a diversity of sports. These kinds of encounters can't be obtained from a book. Besides, when playing games, they enroll in how to coordinate with others, how to confront failure, and how to make use of strategy, and so forth. These advantages are useful in life. To sum up, forcing students to do sports activities is all benefits without harm. It can not only reduce diseases but also increase longevity.

Hi guys, I am Xinh, and I come from Viet Nam. I am a student at Hanoi University. My major is language, and I chose English as the main language to study and essay writing as my topic. Because English is a global language I want to learn and follow it to find new and attractive opportunities in the future. I can hunt for scholarships or jobs in foreign countries. Of course, to do that you have to work hard to study and try your best. Another reason why I like learning English is I want to make friends from around the world because Vietnam is a quite small country and is developing. So many people don't know Vietnam. I want to introduce the history and the beauty of Vietnam to everybody in the world. I hope I can contribute a part of myself to promote the culture and cuisine to international friends.

To whom it may concern, I am writing this letter to tell you my ideas and my opinion about banning mobile phones from shops, restaurants and public transport, and why I think that it is not a good idea . The banning of the use of mobile phones from shops , restaurants and public transport is a tremendous disadvantage for the people who work with smartphones such as: social media managers , vloggers and influencers . Indeed without a mobile device they cannot do their job and I think that this is disrespectful of them . The second reason for which banning mobile devices in public places is not a good idea is because mobile phones are one of the most useful things to communicate with people, especially when you are alone, in a place that you do not know, or if you have to meet a friend and you do not know where he is . The last reason is that mobile devices, and especially smartphones are very helpful in dangerous situations , as with them you can immediately call someone to help you, like the police or a hospital . I hope that you will read this letter, and you will change your mind about banning mobile phones and other devices from public places. Best regards, Paride

I agree with your decision to implement a new municipal rule to prohibit using mobile phones in public places as a part of amendments approved in the council this month. Some people may cast a doubt on why suddenly this restriction on using mobile phones is put in place. However, after seeing immoral behaviors in so many public places, I am on your side. It is because immoral behaviors in turn cause friction or a lawsuit between the people in our town. This trend was surprising to me, to be honest, because I believed that our people living in this town could live a life without a specific rule for mobile phone usage. Yet, the reality was in contrast. I found a lot of cases last year just to argue an offensive behavior triggered by mobile phone usage. To protect our life, this implementation should be welcomed by all of us. That said, one suggestion from my side is to launch a new educational programme for everyone to digest what is moral behavior in public spaces and what isn't, as an example via video streaming service. While it takes time to penetrate this common understanding on how to use a mobile phone in public places, I strongly consent that educational programmes prevent our future conflicts in mobile usage, for sure.

Hi, I hope you're doing well ! Last Friday, I went to a music concert with my dad to attend the first-ever representation of Rossini's Barber of Seville in our town. I wanted to attend that concert because I love Rossini's music. Besides, it was the first time that opera was played in the music hall we went to! For this special event, we had first-class musicians and singers performing in front of us: the London Orchestra and famous singers from all around the world. The actor performing Figaro was excellent and he had a wonderful voice. Most of the seats were already taken when we arrived. Luckily we had booked tickets previously so we managed to get good seats. The show lasted for 2 hours. Although it was long, I really enjoyed being there! Therefore, I strongly recommend you to attend one of their representations. I'm sure you would enjoy it as much as I did! Have a nice day.

I think that students having the same teacher is better than them having a new teacher each year. I'm going to explain my opinion with four reasons. First of all, I can become familiar with the teachers. So, I can ask questions more easily. I am able to speak without nervousness. I think it is good for students. Second, having the same teachers is good for the feelings of the teachers. A teacher can easily become familiar with a school. Then, the teacher will be able to relax at school. Therefore, the teacher can teach students better. It's linked with making students better. The students' feelings are influenced by the teacher's feelings. So, caring for the teacher is an important part of caring for the students. Last, if I am unknown to the teachers, I have to begin the class with introductions. But if I know the teachers I can begin the lesson without introducing myself. That means that I can start studying each subject as soon as possible. Starting studying earlier is making students more intelligent. Having the same teacher has good benefits for the students and the teacher. I realize that changing teachers may have good points too. But because of these reasons, I think having the same teacher is better.

I sleep 10 hours a night, from nine o'clock in the evening to seven o'clock in the morning. Before I go to bed I usually drink a cup of milk, brush my teeth and put my pyjamas (nightdress) on. Sometime I watch the TV in my bedroom or read a book when I don't feel tired. I have been sleeping with my husband of 25 years in the same bed and for this reason I'm very happy and I say thank you to God. I wish my husband happy dreams every evening and I hope to wake up with him near me in the morning.

As my conclusion, depending on the situation, telling a lie is acceptable instead of forbidding lying for one's entire life. The reason why I think so comes from my personal experience. When I was 18 years old, I bumped into a robber in a doom street. I was threatened with a knife and asked whether I had enough money or not. On the spot, I suddenly told a lie not to be captured and harmed. I pretended to be a jobless guy wondering whether I could find food and clothing. I told him I'd give him ten dollars as I picked it up in the street today as a mercy. Fortunately, I was safe because of my wittey lie coming to my mind. If I were to be persistent in the principle not to tell a lie to others, or less flexible, I may get injured or captivated. Of course, on daily occasions, keeping telling lies to others diminishes your trust in the end. Hence, it would be better to refrain from a lie, even on a tiny matter, as a habit. Yet, if you are in a crisis, I would strongly recommend you to be agile and tell lies if needed for your safety. My experience might be extreme but the intention of quoting this example is to stress that telling a lie justifies the end depending on the situation.

I prefer to choose to have a more intense life, as long as nobody lives forever, everybody knows about it, and it can be more interesting and fun. Imagine you can live good and dramatic romances. I would have moments of deceptions and joys. It is incredible to have a life like a roller coaster, up and down all the time. If I chose to live a long life until 100 years old, I think I could not be so happy. I believe that everyone needs to enjoy all the moments of your life until your last second, because we do not know about it, what happens after death, probably paradise or rest forever. The best reason is to have intense moments in our lives. It is so boring have a calm life, but sometimes I think about not having problems. It is normal to have problems, everyone has them. Rich people or poor people and I can't forget to mention deceptions in our lives are normal too. Depending of the point of view about how calm the life will be, if it's a life with emotions, sometimes it can be good, but just living a calm life all the time, all the decades, every time, it is so boring. Intense moments in our lives make us more mature. Sometimes it is so bad to go through a bad moment, but this moment can be necessary for you to grow up in your life and for you to become a good man or woman. Thinking about all my trajectory, I think that I am a winner.

I don't want to have a shorter and intense life. I don't know what there will be after life, so I want to stay here for a long time, as long as possible. I saw many friends that died young, in a car accident, for example. I always thought they were very young, they can spend their lives, they could enjoy the family, they could build a career, but they are not here. For me, it is very sad. I prefer to spend my life quiet and calm, but in a productive way. I want to stay with my family and with my friends. I would like to enjoy my time, watch good films and programs on TV and read books, magazines and newspapers. I will travel a lot, as much as possible. I would like to know many places in the world, from traditional to touristic, but exotic too. I would like old age for this, to travel, have culture and meet new friends in the world. I want to spend the long years when I am ageing to write. I would like to write articles, many articles, about many topics. I would like to write books too. I have many ideas, but today I do not have the time for this. In the future, after my retirement, I will spend my time on this.

Dear Jen, How are you doing? I went to a music concert last week with my mother. I decided to go to the music concert because the person who was performing was my mother's favourite singer. The singer's name is Jacky Zhang. He is a famous singer in Asia and my mother likes his songs a lot. The concert started at 7 pm and ended at 10 pm. The singer sang about 25 songs and made some jokes with us. After the concert ended, we took some photos with the singer. Next time we should go to a concert too. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards, L

Hi Matt! Yes, I must improve my English, because I want to apply to a foreign college. I will subscribe in a conversation club after school to improve my pronunciation and fluency. I'm thinking of watching movies and videos only in English, first with subtitles and then without them to practise listening. Another good idea that I had is to write messages in English to all my friends. What do you think? I'll try to pay attention to all English classes and take the extra curricular activities to gain more experience. I hope this year will be better for everyone!!

This is the age of computers, where tablet and computers are an important part of our life. Above all for young people living in a digital world. Schools can't do without computers and tablets for teaching, but old books have a function again at this time. I think that for some purposes books are a useful tool again. For other tasks it is better to use digital books. For example, to study and learn on a tablet or a computer could be more difficult than to study with a book. Computers could bring distractions, and reading is not the same experience. Thanks to computers and tablets there is no paper waste any longer, which is an awesome contribution to saving trees. In conclusion, we don't have to choose between computers, tablets, and books, because they are all tools that could improve education and knowledge in different ways.

Report about my experience with Write and Improve I started to use Write and Improve a week ago. Till now, I have found it very useful. I like that it is very easy to use. The menu is very clear, with tasks ordered by difficulty. It has different subjects with all kinds of tasks and that is very good because it makes you think and improve your vocabulary. I like that it gives you feedback, corrects your spelling, and you have the option to change your work and make it better. I also like that it shows your progress. This is very good because it makes you do better next time. What I don't like is that in the feedback, on the answer the question, even if I answered all the questions it shows me that I didn't. I will definitely recommend it to my friends. It helped me improve my writing and spelling.

I discovered Write and Improve during my English learning course, and I found it an excellent tool to improve my skill to write about different topics. They are interesting for everyone, but prior to all I appreciated to see the feedback on my reports almost immediately with the highlighted mistakes and a hypothetical result of an exam. Then, you can choose your level between Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced, but it's possible to switch it each time you want and, important information, it's free of charge. You have just to register yourself on the platform, without any ads if you don't allow them, nor requesting of information about your credit cards. With an account, you collect the results of your reports for each level on a graph which evidences your improvement or less. In my opinion, this is the best instrument to check your ability to write about something quickly, if you don't have a physical teacher or a classroom; considering that it's very hard to have them today, due to measures against the spread of the coronavirus, I recommend this useful tool to everyone to stimulate your mind to develop arguments in English properly. Enjoy your course and write, then write again!

Learning English is very important and I tell you why. All around the world you can speak English. English is the most famous language in the world. I have been learning English for 20 years. I studied at school as a small boy. I do not know when. I think I was 8 years old. We had a great teacher for English. At grammar school we had a lot of teachers and our level went down. One year we had four teachers, yes, a lot of changes. Then I learnt alone. I was teaching myself. Everyone would learn English for your life. My reason was a better job. Everyone can study what they want. I would prefer English to other languages. Therefore I will take my exam for the English language in July. I hope I will pass it. I am learning English every day and I am happy. You can do it. Let us go to to a B2 First level. It is degree for each of us. We have to learn a lot. I will have done it on 12 July 2021. Could you join with me? Have a nice day. Tom.

Good Morning Miss Town, I heard a few days ago that you and your council were thinking about a new law that was banning phones and all digital devices in public transport, restaurants and shops. I think it can be, at first, a good idea if people in the city wrote a letter about that law to see their opinions, so I will begin with my idea. I don't think that banning digital devices in those public places is a good idea because these digital devices are important for the life of today. If people don't have their phones in public transport, they cannot receive the message that says that their mother is dead (for example), they won't know that, and, when they get off the bus, they will see that there is a problem. If people cannot use their MP3, they will be obligated to hear the cries of babies or the discussions of people that they don't want to hear. Secondly, if people don't use digital devices in public places, what will they do? They won't speak with anyone, they won't do anything, even if they are bored by the life in public places. I see a lot of people that work on their phones, that do important things on their phones, so I think that banning digital devices isn't a good idea. I hope you will read my letter, I hope you will like it, and I hope it will make you change your decision about that difficult one that I think I cannot answer because I think I don't have the resources. Good luck with this decision, this law and thank you for your attention. Kind regards,

Welfare states like mine provide free health assistance for basic cures, but if you need something more serious, and you live in a small town surrounded by mountains or away from a big city, it can be hard finding a doctor who you need, or a hospital with the right tools for you. This is the result of a transition of the funds that were increased to build a few efficient hospitals, against the reduction of the resources for small first aid centers. About private medical doctors, the argument is the same: an office in a town with a few thousand inhabitants is not as profitable as one in a big city, so, if on one hand it is necessary to have health assistance everywhere you live, on the other hand a doctor chooses to work where there is increased earning potential. The government, in my opinion, have to find a way to keep enough doctors and tools equally divided in their territory, because the entire population has the same right to receive assistance properly.

In the last few years there has been an increasing number of cubicles, with just the space for desk, personal computer and phone. This solution was thought of to guarantee more privacy for every worker, and probably was a good idea by the engineers. Research done by a group that observes the workers' conditions, in fact, discovered that an open space reduces effectively the interaction with each other, maybe because the mind feels it is difficult to exchange information with a colleague when all the others can see and hear your discussion. I think that an open design office is more suitable just for particular jobs, such as architects, or events like meetings and courses. In a daily routine, when each employee has his task to develop, the cubicle is the better solution, with right breaks and a time to socialize personally with the other colleagues. This is my opinion, even if there could be examples against my theory.

Hi friend, My favourite film is The Big Short. The Big Short is a comedy and drama film. This film is about the financial crisis of 2008.

The story is told through four characters who invested against the housing market at the time. I believe that the film will please my friend, and also motivate him to learn about the finance market.

I belong to the group of people who aren't able to play any instrument, unfortunately. That said, I agree that all students could have a chance to study music and play a musical instrument. In my opinion, if a student has a talent in this field, they must have the tools to develop it, like a talent in some sport or using a computer, for example. Music is an important part in almost every life, and the school is the exact time when you can discover if you will be just a listener, on the radio or similar, or a music-maker, like a singer or player in a group. The school has an important role for everyone. If it is possible, it must guide each teenager to his best future, according to his skills, and where it is not possible, it has at least to have tried it. Summarizing, every student should have to study music.

In my green age it was mandatory to join the Army for about one year (the so-called compulsory conscription). Obviously it is an imperfect comparison, but this old rule often resulted in more sense of responsibility in the behaviour of a young boy. In the same way, I absolutely agree with volunteer work during high school, because it can improve the social relations, physical skills and the sense of belonging in a community, as a classroom in the town where the student is. There are already some teenagers that do volunteer work themselves, often following the example of their parents, but I think the school plays a better role to give a civic sense to the future generation and, according to my personal experience, this is an age where you accept some rules only if they are necessary to achieve your target, like a degree or simply to finish the school period earlier.

Doing volunteering work is an amazing way for students to learn skills on the ground and have a first experience in a work environment. It shows the university that the candidate is motivated and has a desire to work in a specific field. For example, if you wish to build a career in organization/ volunteering/ donation you'll need many years of volunteering to get access to the position you're looking for. It will give the student an understanding of the job and the ability to work and understand the task asked. Volunteering may lead to an internship and a job offer, so it should be taken seriously. I haven't volunteered in my life, perhaps thinking about it now it would have been a good idea. Sometimes you feel lost in your life, and you don't know what you want to do. Spending some time volunteering may give you some ideas about a career you'd like to take. I always thought about giving my time for food donations but maybe next time. I wonder if my English is good. For example if tomorrow you ask me to write an essay for a test, will I pass the exam?

In general it is important to tell the truth because that is morally right. But it is not always good to tell the truth. As I see it I am a really honest person, I hardly ever tell a lie. Sometimes the lie could make a person feel sad. So sometimes it is good to tell a little harmless lie. Of course it is not right to lie in some investigation or when you did something really wrong. That is because the first lie leads to other lies to cover the first one. And that is the real issue. On the other hand I believe that it is not bad to tell a little lie to make a person feel better. For instance if someone had a dreadfully done haircut you would tell him a lie that the haircut does not look too bad. And that could make him feel better. Some lies also could encourage people to do something. For example if someone was scared of doing something that looks dangerous, you could tell him that it doesn't look too dangerous. This little lie could make him feel more confident. So, as I see it, is not always important to be honest. So in conclusion, we should think about it before we tell a lie. But we should also think about the consequences of telling the truth. Because the truth can be something that you do not want to hear.

Some people from their childhood are considered to be extremely gifted due to their inborn ability to produce a beautiful sound while singing or they can learn how to play an instrument in no time at all while others find it hard to play even the flute while carrying out compulsory tasks in music classes. Most people claim that music talent is innate and you can't do anything to change that if you didn't inherit that at the moment of your birth . It comes easily in some cases while there are also those for whom being familiar with notes means punishing training. But is it really true that some of us are cut out to be musicians and others simply aren't and that there is nothing to do about that? Scientific evidence shows that each of us is able to develop and shape perfect pitch to make some satisfactory progress in music. What is more the proof is that dealing with music has a good impact on cognitive abilities as well as contributing to maintaining a positive attitude to life and putting musicians in the right frame of mind. With reference to teenagers and children it contributes to better memory as well as higher marks and better performance in tests and exams. So if music proves to be so essential in youngsters' lives maybe we should give support to students to get them involved in this kind of activity. The simplest way to engage them in music is by including the subject in schools' curricula. Even though they haven't felt fondnesss for music so far, lessons can change that. Maybe it would be good to make it obligatory so as to force kids to attend these classes to stimulate affection for instruments. '

I think that exercise is very important for my health. More important is to keep my health. What I would like to stress is that exercise is one of the methods to keep my health. To keep my health, I think I have to take care of my meals, I have to take care of the quality of my sleep. If I only exercise every day, but eat junk foods and do not sleep well, can I keep my health? I think it is very difficult.

For a lot of reasons, my most important holiday was my honeymoon. Prior to that I had already been in fascinating places, but the experience in Madagascar was absolutely the best I've ever had! We started from the capital, Antananarivo, and in sixteen days, with the help of a wonderful local guide with a car, we could see the most characteristics places in the whole country, like forests, typical animals and trees, the lifestyle of a normal person, and his very poor house. We were surprised by his genuine hospitality, without any impression to desire money or goods from us: our impression was he was happy even if he had almost nothing. Within a few days we changed a lot of landscapes, from mountains to the beach along the ocean, from the city to the very rural farms. We came back with our minds lighter, and with our hearts full of love. Today, we can advise every tourist to spend a holiday in this country without staying in a touristic village but tasting this gorgeous life experience.

I think it is a great idea of the high schools. The children experience some real life experiences. Moreover, they can help in the community. You could for example volunteer in a home for the elderly and support the nursing staff. Moreover you could talk with the old people. I am sure that they would be very happy when they can talk to someone. Furthermore, I think you could volunteer for the environment. Maybe you can pick up some garbage, or you could plant some trees. I think the nearby cities have some things that also children/teens can do. You could also engage political. Maybe you have a youth advisory council or something like this. Then you could enforce your ideas for your city so you have a say how your city should look. In conclusion, I think it is a great idea that students have to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate, because students have a lot of free time, which they should use for a good cause.

Television is an amazing communication tool; it can entertain and also educate. Like any other tool, it all depends on how it is used. One must be myopic to see only limited applications of television. Yes, it is the most common use by far and we can tell by the number and the quality of shows that are available for common individuals. There are many sports channels, competitions, and TV series. Every tired soul will find something to console themselves and rest after a long day at work. However, if you are willing to educate yourself, you will find a program with meaningful discussions and content. There are specific channels dedicated to making its audience more knowledgeable in a chosen topic. They usually do not display too many details, but it is certainly enough to raise an interest in a particular discipline.

I believe that it is really important to learn foreign languages. If you want to be connected with the world it is necessary to speak foreign languages. Nowadays, we have online translators where you can find almost all languages in a short time. So it is not necessary to learn a foreign language when you can use the internet. In the past there were not any online translators. People had to learn a language or look in a dictionary. The issue is that using dictionaries takes a really long time But if you want to travel a lot or to live in a different country you have to learn a foreign language. Currently many people or at least the young generation is learning English. Almost every child has English lessons at school. But the problem is that if they do not use the language, the language will be forgotten. That is quite a big issue. Many people had learnt a foreign language and now they remember not a word. In conclusion, from my point of view it is important if you will use it. If not, it is just a waste of time.

I think having new teachers each year is better than having the same teacher for several years, since this is unhealthy for students' learning. It must be difficult to have the same teacher while upgrading the class. We have been learning new things in every new grade and if the same teacher is teaching for four years, he can be inadequate for new subjects. I can give a specific reason if you want to hear it from me. I can say that our primary school teacher was the same person from first grade to fourth grade and my middle school teachers were different each year. I learned more and harder subjects than in primary school. In my opinion, teachers must also attend exams in order for them to be tested on the lessons that they are teaching. Besides this, I do not believe that students must always depend on teachers for everything. It is also the responsibility of students to do more practice themselves. Finally, I can say that, having new teachers each year is better than having the same teacher for several years.

In my opinion, these days learning to speak a foreign language is more important than it was in the past. In this age of a global world, people can move easily, without high costs, across the world, either for work or leisure, so it is important to learn another language beyond the native one. I firmly believe that learning another language is also a way to open the mind to understanding other cultures. Nowadays, in this world where borders are more and more wide people can take advantage of more opportunities. Secondly, it is the age of computers. Thanks to the Internet, every day people are connected to other people of all countries. Not only other people, but everyone can access information, thoughts, and knowledge written in other languages. In this way a person could improve themself, their skills, and also their way of living. To sum up, learning to speak a foreign language is more and more important, because in the modern world there are a lot of opportunities to meet foreign people, to get to know other cultures, and even to live in other countries.

Dear council, Are you sure your decision could be a good idea? I am writing to focus your attention on the central role that communication has in our life. You can be a mother, a manager, a doctor, and in each moment someone can call you for something extremely urgent, and the same could be with a message. I agree that a bus full of passengers with their heads down on their smartphones can give a feeling of sadness, but I don't think a ban could be the best solution. Nobody prohibits speaking to each other, so everyone is free to choose his behaviour, within the limits of civil rules. About this, I could suggest a useful rule about the use of mobile phone in public areas. Can you make a law that requires people to use headphones when talking on mobile phones in public spaces? I, and a lot of citizens like me, can't stand hearing the noises of phone calls, sometimes made with a loud volume. So, if it's your goal to make a rule about using a mobile phones in public areas, please pay attention before banning such an important tool in our daily life, and consider the way to limit its use in a less noisy way than now. I would be grateful if you could to reply to my observations. Your citizen, Holly

Nowadays, many young people have led a sedentary life style that means they rarely get involved in sports activities, and therefore it is suggested they should be required to do sports at least 3 times every week. I completely agree with this method. First and foremost, an inactive life style has affected the physical health of young students. Without adequate physical exercise, they are more likely to suffer from some illnesses, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, which would do harm to their personal life and studies in the long term. Thus, if they are able to participate in sports activities, these problems could be solved because their immune system and body circulation would be enhanced by doing sports. In addition, it is rather difficult for young students to form a healthy life habit without any instruction and help since most of them prefer to stay indoors rather than participating sports activities. Today, due to the increasing popularity of social network websites and the invention of smart phones, youngsters commonly utilize them to socialize with others and play online games in their leisure time which would lead to a sedentary life style and reduce the frequency of doing sports. Thus, if they could be forced to do sports after class, this situation can be reversed effectively. Admittedly, many opponents may disagree that young students should be forced to do sports at certain times as they ought to have rights to make plans for their leisure time. If they are persuaded to take part in those sports activities, they may hardly be interested in those sports and build a more negative attitude to physical exercise. However, one fact needs to be highlighted is that the physical problems caused by the lack of sports activities has been a growing concern around the world, which should be solved immediately. Besides, the addiction to computer games and social network websites has impeded the enthusiasm of doing sports for many young people, and therefore this methodology should reserve this situation effectively. In conclusion, from my own perspective, young students in universities as well as school children should be forced to do sports 3 times a week.

" There is one thing common among successful people which is that they exercise" - Galway I love to exercise and I believe that it is a must for anyone seeking success. For me, I've exercised almost every day for at least the last 2 years in which I lost 10 kg of my weight. Exercising at a gym or outside both have pros and cons, for example exercising outside the gym is more economical and has no limiting rules regarding the time you wish to exercise. On the other hand, exercising at the gym is more intense and you get a mentor.

Nowadays, medical doctors prefer to work in cities because they find better opportunities to be successful than if they work in rural areas. However, this can be changed, improving the health care in remote zones. Firstly, the problems in health services need to be improved in both areas. The main problem in rural zones lies in the lack of growth opportunities, low salaries and the lack of necessary equipment. Due to these problems, medical doctors prefer to work in urban areas rather than rural ones. However, the solution could be implemented by the government, offering better working conditions for medical personnel such as fair salaries and opportunities for growth. In conclusion, our health care services and medical staff need to be improved. People who live in remote areas suffer the lack of these services more than people in the cities. I believe that this problem can be solved if the government works towards improving working conditions for medical staff.

At first impact with the question, it's too easy to answer that the truth is always the only thing to tell and to hear. Sure, this is a utopian reality, and a world without lies will not ever exist for the main reason that human beings are imperfect. This obvious statement drives me along the line of thought that it is a skill of some people telling lies that seem true for a personal aim, and whoever doesn't have this skill is forced to have at least the ability to listen carefully to the sound of the true statements. I don't think that one person can always be able to tell the truth, but there are very important differences about the way and the reasons why we tell a lie: sometimes we have to defend our bad behaviour, often it's necessary for a "politically correct" speech, in other cases it could be just to avoid our listener knowing our business or plans. But, as I said firstly, this is a dangerous joke: if you aren't able to cover your lies, your risk is to damage your public opinion and to seem a liar, even if you tell the truth. However, the best way should be to choose the moments that need a sane lie, and all the others in which it's better to be sincere and truthful.

My favourite film is called The Giver. The story of the film is about a group of people who live in a specific place , and each one has a specific job. The leaders choose their jobs for them when they become teenagers. The hero of the film is called Jounas and his job is to know the whole memory from an old man because all people take some type of anesthetic to make them not feel any feelings because the old people in the area believe feelings are not important and not good for people. For instance, all people there take the anesthetic . However, Jounas was able to change that by breaking the rules and going out to the border of the area. When he arrived there , all people were able to feel again. So the film has a good story, and it teaches us many things. Like we have to choose our life, choose what we want to be in future, and do what we want to do to learn from that. So it is very important to all people to know what they want in this life.

The school of the future will differ in many ways from a standard educational model. The teachers will not occupy the center of the class but will become mere facilitators. However, the importance of their role will persevere. It is the profile of the job that will evolve. The teachers of the future will cherish their pupils and hold them in the center of their attention, the center that has been occupied by the teachers. All of the teachers will be emotionally trained to maintain a high level of communion with the students. They will have a positive attitude and dulcet voice so students can feel that they are welcomed at all times. Students will decide on their schooling programme. They will need to know a little about everything, and everything about one chosen discipline. There will be no grading system. The feedback will point out strengths upon which students can build their knowledge. However, the teachers will always be available for students if they only wish to expand and amend some of their work.

A holiday is always an important moment for people because it's a relaxing time that can help to lower stress levels, load the energy for one's daily routine, and contribute to a person reconnecting with their family. My best holiday ever was when I went with my mother, father, and brother, by car, across the south of Bahia in 5 days. We enjoyed travelling to beautiful places. We visited three cities where there was a lot of nature. We saw animals, lakes, seas, ate good food, and slept in very comfortable hotels. The moment was very pleasant because it was a time where it was possible for the family to bond. There was a nice atmosphere and rest in a reconection between all these things. This was the first trip that we made. And maybe the choice of the best holiday ever is because of this. Unlike the others trips that we made as a family, there weren't a lot of expectations and we just wanted to stay close and far away from problems.

The purpose of this report is to give all the general information about a site suggested to us by our teacher to practise and improve our English. Our teacher had never suggested a site to improve our English writing skills, and honestly I thought my progress would have been more quickly and radical. However, there are some aspects I really appreciate, but others disappointed me. I do not like the fact that I have to subscribe a contract and I should pay a fee in order to practise with some tasks. This kind of resource should be free and all of us should be given the opportunity to practise with it even if our English tuition is not so high. Only when you practise with it for several weeks, can you see some radical and persistent breakthroughs. What I really appreciate is the large number of tasks you can choose. What is more, they are classified in groups depending on your English level. It means you can adjust the tasks to how you feel more comfortable. The percentage of new users is increasing, this is the reason why I think the site should be recommend.

The way in which work environments are organised in enterprises is often discussed. Companies have different ways of working, including different ways of organizing work areas, but companies should be aware of providing a comfortable work area. Personally speaking, an arrangement without walls is the best way to offer a friendly atmosphere to your employees. People need to have constant contact with others. On the other hand, talking about the work areas, you need to have the freedom to interact with your co - workers avoid stress problems and this allows your staff to work in teams. NA,. If the company gives a good working atmosphere, the tasks will be done as well as possible, thus benefiting both sides, the company and the workers.

As to "The school of the future" in Japan, I think it will become more flexible. At present, basically we have to go to school physically and have to study in a classroom face to face. But after the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the Japanese government had to lock down the cities. And a lot of schools were closed for several months so that many children could not go to school. As a result of this, it was very hard for children and teachers to catch up on the original school activities. Through this experience, the Japanese government decided to change the way of education. The government gave PC tablets to all students and started to use the tablets for the lessons. I think this is the first step for a school of the future. In the near future, we will be able to study online, it will not be necessary to go to school physically. To be honest, I think there are many problems to solve to bring about the school of the future. But it will be changed to go in a better way.

Every person has the right to equally benefit from the health sector, or that is what is written in the law because most people do not have access to doctors or medications. There are some countries that do not have hospitals, and even in the same country, some regions have large health institutions, while others lack doctors. These areas where there are no doctors are mostly rural areas because most doctors want to live in urban areas and earn a lot of money. We cannot say that they are wrong, it is not very moral, especially for a doctor, but earning money is essential for life. It is up to the government to solve this problem, as some governments have their own way of solving the doctor shortage. One of them is to distribute newly graduated doctors to the country by lot, so that enough doctors are appointed to each region. Of course, this method is a method applied for practitioners, it is not common for specialist physicians to go to rural areas. To solve this, governments can impose a salary increase on rural doctors or send them in a specific order. Of course, the doctors to be sent in a certain order should be carefully selected, because it would not be right to send doctors who have a child or a family member that they take care of.

Nowadays, almost all children spend their free time playing video games. This kind of entertainment may have positive and negative effects, but it depends on the environment in which the child develops. In my opinion, video games don't have a negative impact on children. In the market you're able to get any kind of video game such as didactic and battle ones. The positive and negative effects will depend on the atmosphere in which children grow up, then bad behaviour could be slightly affected by the games. In addition to this, there isn't research which shows that video games have negative effects (psychologically speaking), however, there is research which shows positive effects on children and some video games have been created to develop their skills. To sum up, video games can have positive effects on children, but everything depends on the atmosphere in which they develop and how children are exposed to a certain kind of video game.

As a matter of fact, English is spoken all over the world. Wherever you go, everyone talks in English. Consequently, by speaking English, I am able to travel worldwide.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I disagree. First, I want to mention the advantages of books. Though technology improves steadily, books are still healthier. And although books can burn easily, digital books can vanish and crash more easily. For instance, a rookie mistake can delete all the data. On the other hand, digital books can be stored more easily and besides, don't require that much protection. Also, they can connect to big data. We don't have to wait for the latest version if e-books can receive instant updates. Thus, I claim we should maintain both kinds of books. Is there a fire in a library? No problem, we have all the same data in digital books anyways. Some books are deleted? Okay, we just have to scan the solid versions of those books. What do you think?

There are many things that affect our health. If we look from a narrow perspective, only exercise seems important. In addition to exercising, you should eat healthy foods and take care of yourself. In general, TV programs are twisting the facts about health and healthy foods. Therefore, people believe in some false ideas. If a person is overweight, he most probably has some health problems. In this case, he should go to a professional dietitian to ask for a diet program. Of course, you do not have to go to a dietitian, however, if dietitians are out of work, global warming can destroy the world. Dietitians cannot survive an hour without driving a Porsche, but you should give them 200 dollars and you do not need to look at YouTube videos. You do not need to pay that much money to live a healthy life, however, spending money on your food and exercises more than on consuming alcohol and smoking, will be better for you. Finally, I would like to mention that eating healthy foods and protecting yourself is very important.

Keeping animals in zoos or letting them free is widely discussed. All animals should live in their habitats, it is the law of nature. However, there are many aspects to consider before releasing the zoo animals. Personally speaking, all animals deserve to live freely in their habitats. Wild animals should develop their nature away from human-controlled environments and we should learn to admire wildlife without hunting and destroying ecosystems. On the other hand, it is known that many people fight to free animals from this kind of places, but there are some aspects to consider before doing it. For instance, the fact that possibly animals which have grown up in zoos wouldn't be able to survive on their own, because they're used to being fed by humans. To sum up, if we want to admire animals in their habitats freely, humans must learn to look after the ecosystems and the life in them. Also, we have to provide better conditions for zoo animals and try to make their lives as close to wildlife as possible.

I do not like to have futuristic talks, however, in my opinion, travelling will shift to space. Interstellar journeys will be introduced by travel companies. In the future, communications between two planets will be among the routine applications. If we talk about our planet and it means in 100-150 years (we have only 100 years left to live here), I think water vehicles cannot improve too much since there will be a shortage of water in the future. Besides this, trains, buses, and metros will have unusual designs and private vehicles and buildings will disappear. Now, the high population rate is a very big problem. If pandemic diseases do not continue, the streets will be overflowing with people. This disease is a painful way to reduce population, however, if it did not occur, it would have brought the end of the world.

I believe that it is better for students to have new teachers each year. I have three reasons. First, if the teacher is bad for a student, the student needs to endure them for several years. It is not good for an important period of the student's growth. Second, if the teacher is only one person, it is difficult for the students to judge if the teacher is good or not because they don't have a person whom they can compare with. As a result of that, if the teacher has an unfair thinking, students might be affected badly. Finally, one teacher's view and thinking is very limited. A teacher might notice a student's good points, but another teacher might not notice the student's good points. I believe that each student has several different good points. If they are found, the student can extend his/her specific talent. It is good for him/her.

Based on my one month practice, I will report to you regarding the points which I like and dislike about it. First, I like the rapid speed of the feedback.

So I don't need to wait and we can try a lot of exercises at the same time. I can improve my English very fast. Second, I also like that I am able to practise anywhere by using my smartphone. Actually, today I was practising in a park while sitting on a bench in the sunshine. On the other hand, I don't like that it is not easy to ask for more detail. However, this is a minor point for me.

Generally speaking, people who live in rural areas are fewer than in urban cities. Also, the financial basis in rural areas is lower than in urban cities. As a result of this, doctors are not able to make a lot of money because of the shortage of patients and the area's budget. However, the necessity of doctors in rural areas is the same as in urban cities. Thus, we need to find some solutions to this problem. Regarding this problem, I would like to propose three solutions. First, obtaining support from the national government. For example, transferring the money from national to rural areas as a medical budget. Second, creating a new law where every doctor needs to go to a rural area for several years in their career as an obligation. Finally, changing the government system. Political power and rights in rural areas are lower than in the national government. So it is better to change the social system and transfer the power from the national government to each rural area.

Telling the truth for some people is always essential. Indeed, for them it is unacceptable to tell a lie, even when it is told for a good reason or an important motivation. Telling the truth is essential in life, however, I do not agree with the idea of never telling a lie. In my opinion, sometimes, a lie can be extremely helpful and useful. Indeed, telling a lie to someone for good reasons can help you in various situations. For instance, when you have to make a bad announcement to a friend, at that moment you can tell him a lie, but afterwards you must tell him the reality. Indeed, I think that every one of us sometimes tells lies, the important thing is to be sure that it does not cause any issues. Sometimes , telling a lie can help a person. Indeed, many people lie for various and different reasons. Sometimes, for example, they tell lies to not overstress, stress and cause harm to someone . I think that telling a lie, for these reasons, is acceptable and especially is helpful .

These days people are becoming eager to tell the truth, some some consider that is important, while others believe that it is impolite to tell the truth. This essay will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal conclusion. On one hand, through my personal experience, I believe in the significance of the feelings of people, for example, I don't talk about anything, only if someone asks me, because not everybody can accept my opinion, and it's not my business. In addition, sometimes I give advice to my friends, for instance, once before, a couple of years ago, I went through a difficult position, when I saw my best friend treated her mother severely. So I advised her for her benefit. On the other hand, often on specific occasions, I prefer to exchange compliments, to illustrate, such as a wedding party, events and festivals because we must be prise of their occasion in order to make them happy and as thanks for the invitation. Additionally, I don't consider the praise or courtesy is a lie, exactly on the contrary, I think often I need to praise my friend when I see she is depressed in order to improve her psychological state, and change her mood, by mentioning her beautiful qualities. Also, people do not need to give a truthful opinion, because they have enough, so that's not essential frequently, to illustrate, maybe the truth can injure them or they don't want to anybody to notice it. Hence the belief that it is an important thing to tell the truth but we should check if it's necessary or not.

My reason for learning English, by Alberto Blanco. When I was young, I started to learn Spanish and English. As time went by, I thought that it was very important to me. Several times I have thought about it. I decided to improve my English level for many reasons. Firstly, because I like travelling and English is the most useful language around the world. Perhaps in the future Chinese will be the most important. Secondly, I like developing my brain. Experts have said that learning a language is the best way for it. Furthermore, I study it to help my sons to do their homework. Finally, perhaps the most important nowadays, to improve my work level with a promotion. If you have many points, you have more opportunity to reach your objective. This year I'll try to pass the B1 level, and perhaps, the following year will start with the B2 level.

These days training has become commonplace, so some people want to apply the decision, while others believe that it is not necessary, and doesn't have any benefits. On one hand, most people with that decision that sports in the morning are mandatory. For example, the government prevents road means of transportation, people can only use a bicycle or walk when they go to school or any educational institutions. In addition, all the families welcomed this suggestion, because they are suffering with their children, to illustrate, after the Covid-19 pandemic the children's weight increased, because they were not walking or hiking out of their house, where that those bad habits have negative influences, such as psychological diseases or troubles in their body. On the other hand, developments in the world have negative effects, for instance, frequent use of electronic devices has risks for their brain and mind, frequent use of the electrice devices have risks to their brian and mand, where studies have proven the risks of the technological means for memorization and they can't memorize very well. Also, the great country in the health field is Japan. It has become number one in the largest rate of health in its society, because they're very eager for food, where reverse that in their job. Japan is still maintaining their food, such as sushi and other popular food without unhealthy recipes, additionally, and they go to their job without conveyances. Most people need simple training in order to get rid of some wrong habits, like waking up late, no breakfast in the morning and weakness in their muscular strength. The last problem, from an economic side, where all the wrong behaviour reduces exports, for instance, when people don't do exercise that affects the output in the factories. Finally, it also has a high cost in order to treat the weight of patients. Some government can't bear that, especially in the students' category, because they're considered to be an important generation.

I am so excited and impatient to start this new school year. Actually, it is an opportunity for me to achieve some goals in different subjects. First of all, I would like to keep learning sciences, such as mathematics, physics, or chemistry. These classes are captivating and I am keen on studying sciences. Moreover, I would like to keep following language courses because I am convinced that it is very helpful and useful for travelling all around the world. Besides, recently, I have been improving in Italian; that's why this new school year could be the moment to become fluent in this language. However, I don't enjoy history, geography, or philosophy. Indeed, I need to be focused on my learning. Nevertheless, those subjects are paramount to obtaining the high school diploma. As a matter of fact, students have to sit an examination in literature and sciences. In order to achieve my goals, I am going to study hard every evening so that I will learn every single lesson by heart. To put it in a nutshell, this school year is a chance to expand my knowledge in sciences but also in literature.

Honest statements have not always been convenient for every person to tell. Correspondingly, they speak untruthfully instead. However, some criticism has been made of the act of lying, even though the lie is classified as a white lie. Nevertheless, some people still think that it is appropriate to tell a white lie. Firstly, spreading dishonest information has always been judged as a sin. This doctrine has been manifested in children's mindset from an early age. The reason behind this cultivation has a religious purpose, which correlates with the concept of karma. Secondly, a group of people is sceptical regarding the act of lying since it brings disadvantages for others. Every human being will certainly feel betrayed if someone tells them a lie, especially if it comes from a closely-related acquaintance. In contrast, those reasons are broken by the advantages of a white lie. Even though a white lie has been denied by some communities, a white lie has been acceptable for majority of people. A white lie is believed to be beneficial instead of bringing disadvantages. Parents lying to their child for the purpose of eating vegetables by having slices of vegetables hidden underneath rice is a case in point. In conclusion, giving untruthful information is often unacceptable since it brings harm to other people. Based on the aforementioned information, a white lie brings benefits instead of drawbacks, making it tolerable for the majority of people.

Now, I'm going to talk about my favourite season of the year, and why it's so special for me. Well, my favourite season of the year is summer. I love it for many reasons. - The first one is because I have vacation and I usually go on trips in summer. It should be clarified that I really enjoy travelling. - The second reason is because I can see my friends. I go to the pool and spend all my afternoons there. - I also love the hot and warm weather. For me it's better than winter for that reason. - The days are longer. - I love staying in the sports centre to eat a pizza there and have a soda because I meet my friends and we play until we're bored. These are some reasons why I love summer.

In my opinion, we are already experiencing the school of the future. Since we are passing through this pandemic period, all of our lessons are held online and through computers. Similarly, school ceremonies are moving to online platforms. In the future, everyone will have more online meetings and learning sessions than they were having in the past. I think that the school of the future will still be the same. The learning techniques and the school buildings have not changed much from how they were hundreds of years ago. Holograms and other cool things are the first ideas that come to most people's minds when they think of schools of the future. However, they have probably watched Star Wars too much. If Stanley Kubrick had not started the futuristic/fantastic fashion, no one would have tried to develop them. In addition, most people think that school will not exist some time in the future. Therefore, I think that all of these are unrealistic ideas. Lastly, I can say that the school of the future will still be the same with the pandemic time that we are living.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that studies abroad have helped a lot of people to speak fluently and have more confidence in languages. At the moment, it is being a success with young students. However, it doesn't get at everybody, since students need time, money, high marks, and a correct attitude. Firstly, getting money is quite tough, and it is a crucial part of studying abroad, although you can get a scholarship, which is given to students who don't have the resources to pay for the trip. In spite of everything, there are few scholarships in our days. Secondly, an important advantage of studying abroad is getting used to listening to native people. Moreover, you will acquire those astonished habits and celebrations of that foreign country. Finally, you will meet new people who come from different parts of the world, and it is a superb opportunity to develop social abilities, especially if you are shy most of the time. You will be so proud of yourself if you make friendships abroad. As a conclusion, I think it will a great experience if you have the opportunity to study abroad, so don't miss it.

Nowadays, many people, mostly young people, search for possibilities to study abroad in order to improve their skills. However, studying abroad is not always an easy process. Firstly, there are many options to be able to study abroad, almost all universities offer the opportunity to make a school exchange. With this kind of exchanges, students have the opportunity to go abroad without the need for spending lots of money and mostly foreign universities are in charge of tuition fees, food, and accommodation. On the other hand, there are some negative factors to take into consideration for studying abroad. Even though the majority of the cost can be covered by the universities, sometimes students have to cover the cost of the journey and this cost may be high. The language is important as well, students must have a high level of English to be able to communicate with foreign people, and another factor is loneliness, something which you have to deal with. In conclusion, currently for a student, the opportunities to study abroad are many. Comparing advantages with disadvantages, the students only have to develop some skills before taking the decision to travel and work hard to have a chance. It is expected that in the future school exchanges will be an easier process than today.

To begin with, I'd like to say that I can sleep with lights on and noises, but I prefer to sleep in quiet surroundings. One reason is that I feel more comfortable when no one is around, or better said I enjoy the silence when the room is idle. It makes me feel calm and relaxed, which is pretty beneficial for a good night's sleep. When it comes to light, I need to mention that I generally like dark so it is kind of obvious that it is more suitable for me to sleep in completely darkness. In addition, light can be stressful for the eyes. If there is constant light your eyes have no chance of relaxing, which can lead to problems in having a good sleep.

Dear Suzy, I hope you are very well. The covid pandemic is going very badly so you take care of yourself. We will meet again soon after this situation gets better. As I told you in my last emails, I was going to go to the BIGBANG concert this week on Saturday. And I did it. I went to the concert with my friends and I was really happy and very excited. BIGBANG are my idols, I have been a big fan for 10 years and I have always tried my best to go to a concert one time in my life. And in the end, I was able to do it. Do you know BIGBANG? They are the biggest boy group idols from Korea. They have 5 people, with G Dragon being the leader. They have been guiding Korean music for the past 10 years. Although there are many boy groups that make their debut every year, they have always maintained the first position in communication. This concert was held to celebrate the 14th anniversary of BIGBANG. They performed all their best songs from their debut to now, as a way of giving thanks to everyone. I felt like I was reliving the period of my youth. I was so happy and emotional. And I think it was one of the best moments in my life. And I'll never forget. I will always be there to support BIGBANG and always be a small girl fan in the VIP Fanclub. BigBang will hold a concert in your country in September.

In my opinion, if producers create healthy ideas, television programmes can be helpful in the education of people. Television channels have game show programmes on science and technology. However, most of these programmes are not good enough, except a few of them. Television is not only an entertainment tool, but it also makes documentaries. Television channels are trying to do their best. Most people say that Turkish television is not able to reach global standards, only trying to meet the public's demands. I agree that "Turkish series are not good" since the scriptwriters are not thinking carefully when they write the texts. Our directors are also applying what they learned at art school. Art and cinema schools create artists like a factory. They are all the same and they are using the same formulas. They do not have any creative ideas about their professions. If it continues to work like this and television continues to use the same shows in all countries, we will watch only the same factory's products in different languages. Lastly, I can say that TV creators must be able to upgrade their shows.

Writing about television is a good challenge because there are so many ways to talk about this topic, but I will talk about how television improves the way people receive information about the world. First, I think the idea of television in the beginning was just to entertain people and pass the time. But presently the idea of television is a lot more comprehensive because there are many TV shows that teach us something important and these are things that we probably don't see in school. NA,. most TV shows which are on television are just to entertain us and pass the time with bullshit things. I think the way that we use television is the principal discussion here because there are many people that put on bad channels that don't add anything to our life. So if you are one of these people I think the problem is you use television the wrong way.

Some people might believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. However, I also believe that zoos are not good for animals. I would like to consider that I replace animals to human based on some examples. First, animals in zoos are separated from their parents and children. I do not put up with that. It is very cruel. Second, animals in zoos end their lives in a cage or very limited field. The same as with the first example, it is very cruel too. Third, animals in zoos are seen by a lot of people. Their surroundings are not calm. Fourth, there are no options for anything. For example, they are not able to eat their favorite foods. They are not able to get married to whom they love. The situation is not fun for me. I believe that no one has the right to control anyone's life including any animals. So it is difficult for me to accept zoos.

Employees in some offices are working in enclosed workstations or cubicles. However, I do not like that way. Moreover, I believe that it might be more efficient not to separate employees from each other by walls. If there are walls, it is not easy to talk with anyone. If there are no walls and all the space is free, employees are able to sit down where they like every day. Because of the spread of COVID-19, a lot of employees have been working from home remotely. As a result, many employees don't often get to use their desk in their office. Then individual desks were no longer needed compared to before. So we do not have the need to make walls to separate each employee. I understand that the situation and efficiency depends on the industry. However, if the company is able to have options, I recommend not to set up walls in workplaces.

Nowadays, education institutions include in their curriculum extra activities for their pupils, such as music and arts. On the other hand, some schools do not offer music in their syllabus. In my concept, the arts are crucial in all education systems, and consequently, they should be taught to everybody. Learning music is one of the activities which help to develop mental skills, especially when teaching starts from early childhood. There is a great deal of social research that has proved the positive connection between brain development in children and the ability to play a musical instrument. Some schools, for instance, have introduced music classes in their schedule, however, and unfortunately, only private education institutions can provide these classes because of the high cost of musical instruments that parents might not be able to afford. Another point to take into account is to be considered as a music expert, a person needs many hours of full time and dedicated study, and obviously, this is something that public schools are no able to provide, and probably students neither. I consider that teaching music at school should be compulsory. Our society must find ways to engage our children with the arts because they are part of our history, culture and spirituality.

I think that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. If you are rich, but are in hospital being sick for a long time, you can't enjoy your life enough. Even if you are rich, you can't pay to be healthy. When I was young, I thought being rich was the most important. But as my life style has changed, I got married and had children, my opinion has changed. To be healthy is the most important factor in my life. I think that if you want to be rich, it is necessary not only to work harder than others, but also to have good luck. That is, apart from one's effort I think good luck is also needed to be rich. But I think that to be healthy it is necessary to pay attention to your lifestyle yourself. That is, I think that being healthy depends on you.

The second reason is that to speak and write English fluently is one of the conditions for promotion in our company. Our company has many branches all over the world. So if I want to do business in overseas branches as a general manager, at least I have to meet the language requirements of our company. So I have to learn English very hard. The third reason is that I'd like to go to travel around the world. When I am on my trip abroad, it is necessary to speak English at least. At present, I can' t go abroad because of the COVID-19 outbreak in the world, but I have to keep learning English.

Dear Friend, I went to the cinema yesterday and watched a movie. It was good. But it can't compare to my favourite film. Talking about my favourite film, there is no way I can leave out " Bambi ." I know this is quite an old film now, but what it says and means made a really deep impression on me. So today, let's talk about why this film is so heart-touching and necessary to watch. The story is mainly talking about a male deer born in the forest and starting his life as a wild deer. He went through a lot of difficulties. He lost his mom in a hunt where humans came to capture them. He met his father, and started to act like a real buck. Years later, he found his true love, but fire broke out in the forest. Bambi got hurt. His dad encouraged him to stand up. After the fire, he had lost his dad, but he had grown up, found a lovely wife, and started a new part of his life. I really recommend you read this book because it is a really touching story as it tells me how difficult it is to survive in the wild, getting to know the world by yourself. Regards, Your Friend

Playing is a natural way to interact and practice different skills. Video games, in my opinion, have a similar role for young people, therefore, I have positive feelings about children using video games. I am going to explain it now. There are many research studies about the beneficial effects of gaming on children. One of those has found that boys and girls develop and improve important social skills, such as team-work and fast strategy decisions, which are highly valued by multinational companies. Another very important ability to be developed during games is the understanding and the practice of the English language in reading, listening, and speaking mostly. The last paper I read was focused on the improvement that young people have in their performance when solving problems, too. Parents' negative thinking about video games comes from their ignorance and a bad relationship with their children. Basically, many of them grew up without experiencing video games and they are scared of them. If parents balance the permission to play games with socializing in real life for their children, it could be beneficial. It is only necessary to take care of the type of games and the amount of time they allow their children to play.

Some people might argue that it is necessary for children to study music in schools. I understand where they are coming from. However, I don't agree with them. I think that music makes us happy and it is good for us to study music. However, there are a lot of options other than music. For example, it might be a painting. It might be a video game. Music is just an option. So it is not necessary to study in schools. People should study music as an option if they like it. It might be painful for people who don't like music to study music in schools. It is not good to let people do what they dislike. Moreover, music classes need a lot of money. Schools need a special room and musical instruments. They are not reasonable. Thus I think that all students do not need to take a music class.

Dear Jen, So nice to hear from you! How are you doing? In your last email, you introduced your favourite film to me. Now, I am going to introduce my favourite film to you.

Nowadays, thanks to technological advances, people have easy access to a lot of kinds of shows. Television offers a wide variety of shows, but people should be aware that not all programmes show good information to us. Firstly, with the invention of the TV, people were able to have access to another kind of entertainment, and cable TV has increased the range of shows that we can watch. There are shows of different topics for all ages, some of these shows can be used to learn any kind of subjects, such as history, science and astronomy. However, there are shows that were not created for educational purposes, performances that show violence and inappropriate language. That is why people should learn how to choose appropriate shows for children, even for ourselves. To sum up, we have access to a wide range of shows which can be good or bad. Currently, we are capable of obtaining information about shows we are interested in, so it depends on ourselves if we watch an educational show or not.

I think that learning a foreign language is important these days. I think that it is necessary for us to learn a foreign language as a part of liberal arts. I also think that through learning a foreign language we can find the difference between a foreign language and a mother language. Furthermore, we can find the importance of learning a mother language. So I think that learning a foreign language is important, even these days. Some might point out that because of the improvement of translation technology it is not necessary to learn a foreign language. But I think this is not right. Even if the translation technology has improved and we can use an automatic translation machine, I think it is not enough to communicate with foreign people. I think that it is also important to understand a foreign culture when we communicate with foreign people. To understand a foreign culture, I think learning a foreign language is one of the best ways.

Some people might argue that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle. I understand where they are coming from. However I don't agree with the argument. First, does an inactive lifestyle definitely have a negative impact on their health ? Do people die early if they don't do sports? I don't have related data in my hand. Also I often see people who don't do sports live a long life. So I don't know the positive correlation between health and sports. Second, even though there is an obvious data which indicates the positive correlation, it is not good to make people do sports as obligation. I understand that it is important to put people's health first. However, we should respect people's right. People have rights to do something they like. For example, some people might feel happiness when they are in their house all the time. They might understand that it is better to do sports for them. However, they want to put their happiness first. Still, should we force them to do sports ? Third, some university students and children have already been doing some sports spontaneously. In that case, if schools and universities forced them to do sports more, they would be tired. I don't know the percentage of them. There is no data. However, it is definitely not zero. Fourth, favorite sports are different for both children and university students. It might not be pleasant to do sports they don't like. It is not good for their mental health. Thus I don't agree with the argument.

INTRODUCTION The aim of this report is to explain my experience with Write and Improve and to make recommendations for my classmates. REASONS WHY I LIKE WRITE AND IMPROVE Firstly, I found Write and Improve utterly useful because in the past I didn't have any way to practise my writing, and so now, using this website, my writing has gotten a lot better.

REASONS WHY I DIDN'T LIKE WRITE AND IMPROVE Nevertheless, I found it absolutely awful that Write and Improve had a timer for timing writing because when I used it, I felt so concerned about not finishing the writing on time.

Hi buddy! How are you? You won't believe what an amazing film I saw yesterday! I watched The Avengers again, yes! For the seventh occasion, ha,ha! It's a film about a group of Marvel comics superheroes that meet together to fight against an alien invasion led by Loki, Thor's brother, one of the protagonists. Loki works for Thanos, who wants to get the infinite stones, but The Avengers defeat Loki's army and catch him. I think you'll really love that film, because it is full of action, jokes and a lot of special effects.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that people do not get worried about hours of sleep or posture habits to have a healthy way to meditate and relax. For this reason, most individuals prefer resting in a calm room, while other men and women enjoy staying in a noisy room. Firstly, it has been proved that silence helps the brain to disconnect and stop thinking. Moreover, stress decreases and people will be able to be relaxed in tense situations. Secondly, it is true that being used to noise and busy situations increases concentration skills, in the same way that people learn to support danger or critical factors. Thirdly, most people argue that Asian methods to be calm are more effective than being exposed most of the time to noises, violent areas and heavy metal music. As a conclusion, I think it is better to sleep in a calm room, because I can sleep faster and my brain forgets stressful information efficiently.

I think that it is impossible for computers and tablets to replace books completely in schools and universities. With the improvement of technologies, I also think that computers and tablets can replace books to some extent in schools and universities. To replace them completely, I think two problems should be solved. I think the first problem is how to digitize historical documents. A lot of historical documents are not digitized, so you have to go to libraries to read them if you need them. I think it is difficult to digitize such historical documents and it will take a lot of time to do so. I think the second problem is how to keep the security of an IT network system. If the IT network is down because of some trouble, it is impossible to use computers and tablets. Recently it has often happened in the world that an IT network has shut down because of a computer virus. So I think it will take a long time for computers and tablets to replace books completely.

Someone might prefer a shorter life but much more intense. I understand where they are coming from. However I would like to live a long, calm life. There are three reasons. First, I would like to use a lot of new technologies. As you know, technologies have been developing and are innovated every day. I am not able to imagine new technologies in the future. So I am looking forward to using new technologies and living a new lifestyle. I might live on the moon. Second, if my life is long, I will be able to experience a lot of kinds of things. There are a lot of things which I want to do. If my life is short, I will be able to choose just a few things. However, if my life is long, I won't worry about anything. I will be able to go where I want to go. I will be able to eat whatever I want. I will be able to read a lot of books, which I want. Third, because I am always happy when I am calm. I like drinking a cup of black tea outside with my wife on nice day. I like to lie down on grass in a park. I like to chat with my lovers and friends calmly. Anyway, I have naturally lived like that already. I will live more than 100 years.

Given a choice between a long, calm life and an accelerated lifestyle, I would opt for slowing down the pace of life for these following reasons. For one thing, there are potential drawbacks of leading a fast-paced lifestyle. Due to being pressed for time it is highly likely that people would rush things, and inevitably make mistakes. Also, people would avoid reflecting on experiences, therefore no lessons are learned and no adjustment is made for the better. Even though people might feel better about their use of time compared with those with a leisurely pace of life, a faster lifestyle could lead to stress and its consequent effects. For another, adopting the lifestyle which is calm and tender could be beneficial. Firstly, people would have moments to reflect on their experiences, hence improving the future outcome when the same scenario happens. Secondly, this pace of living would allow people to avoid the probability of being stressed as well as the better chance to relax and recharge their energy. That is the reason why every year thousands of people flee the big cities in search of the rural idyll. Finally, some people are not driven by a determination to stridently blaze a trail through life due to their deep appreciation of the present. It may also be a smarter and more strategic approach to life's unpredictable turns. In conclusion, though living intensely with a timetable full of activities sounds exciting, I think people should get out of the fast lane and introduce some slowness to their lives.

IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN ENGLISH Have you ever given a thought to the matter concerning how your life would change if you spoke perfect English? Let me tell you my experience with regard to this issue because it definitely changed my whole life. Incredible though it may seem, I have learnt English on my own, although it is fair to draw attention to the fact that I learnt some of it at school, as well as in high school. But most of my current English is the result of years and years of hard work with that language. The primary purpose for me was no other than understanding the lyrics of my favourite songs as I am a music lover, without a doubt whatsoever. That is why my curiosity for learning English started. What I had never imagined was the fact that I would become an English teacher. What is more, had it not been for my passion for that language, it would be quite hard to find a suitable job for me nowadays in which I could manage to develop my job and my role as a mother at the same time. So, next time you stop and wonder if you are capable of learning English, whether you are old or not, you should take into account the fact that, as I said before, it is never too late to do it. Besides, you will not regret doing so.

Someone might argue that it is more important to be rich than to be healthy. I understand where they are coming from. However, I don't agree with them. I believe that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. There are three reasons for that. First, because I believe that happiness comes from one's health. If I want to eat what I want, good health is required. If I want to travel where I want to go, good health is required too. Second, there is the possibility to make money if I am healthy. On the other hand, the way in which I use money is restricted if I am not healthy. Third, if I am not healthy, I need to put up with pains. It is not comfortable. Of course, I understand that it is important to be rich too. However, I believe that wealth is based on my health.

But when they are talking happily on their bicycle, Li Huan Ying is hit by a truck that drives by and dies, and her daughter has been pulled into a warm memory. l like this film, because it is about the story of a mother and a daughter.

Nowadays, learning several languages is more important that it was in the past. To begin with, all states in the world are connected to each other. Because of globalization, countries exchange information, goods, and people. Indeed, many employers are expecting that their employees speak different languages. For instance, in biotechnology, a lot of research is made in the USA whilst in China, scientists are carrying out experiments about little girls' resistance to AIDS. The communication between countries is primordial these days for sciences as well as business. Besides, means of transport have improved, it is now possible to travel worldwide. It is pleasant to be able to go to a foreign country and discover new territories and people. However, it is sometimes challenging to get by without speaking the language. That's why, speaking a language is a way to be embedded in a country with a different culture from ours. To put it in a nutshell, not only is it crucial to speak a foreign language for work, but it is also a way to get by and to be embedded in another country.

I do not have a strong opinion about zoos, and I think that I can understand both sides. With my limited knowledge, I would describe myself as a zoo supporter. I can't help it, but I like zoos. I am not that keen on animals, but I think that the reason is that a zoo visit used to be a special day in elementary school and I can remember the feeling. The other thing is simply that animals are not humans. It would be cruel to keep innocent people against their will in a cage, but I think that animals can appreciate such conditions. They are not driven by fulfilment. They don't need high stimuli to function properly. However, I understand that it is too much for some people. If you believe that animals are like humans, you can't like places like zoos. So I just don't think about the animals and I agree that it is ignorant, but you know what?

In my opinion, one of the most important characteristics of honest and loyal people is to tell the truth and let me say that it not only defines a person as a good human being, but also as a reliable professional. We know that the modern world is full of liars and as all we know one of the places of the world where we can find a large group of dishonest people is the dirty place of politics. Despite what I said, we have to notice that it wasn't always that way, because some years ago we used to see politicians that told the people the truth and, most important of all, some of them didn't have problems with warning the population about the problems, the mistakes and other things related to them that of course today they don't have the capacity to say. That is the best example that I can give you in order to explain my opinion about the theme that I was asked to talk about. Speaking about the specific point of the answer: of course it is not acceptable to tell any lie. Even if we have negative points or mistakes made in the recent past we can't tell lies to other people. Lies can destroy both great relationships and friendships and make the world an unpleasant place to live in and in order to finish: we know that today's world is a very toxic place. So it is our responsibility to make it a better place for our sons.

These days life has become important. Some people believe that depends on their health, while others believe that it is not necessary, because they think it's from their imagination. This essay will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal conclusion. On one hand, most people prefer a long life, regardless of if they suffer and have a hard life, for example, we always go through difficult situations and have hard circumstances, but we are still sticking to life, because it has family, relatives and beautiful landscapes. On the other hand, all history mentions that a long life is crucial, and all the history mentioned about long life is crucial, although from the growth and aging, To illustrate, from long ago everyone tends to illustrate a long period, where death is scary. Studies have proven when a human lifespan increases, they hope for death more than life, especially, when their bodily health and teeth are worse. So I prefer a short life, because it's the better option and truth of life, and I believe that after death there is another life with my soul in heaven. NA,. I love my life but when I see other people suffering from poverty, war and violence, I give thanks for God and hope they improve their standard of living. In conclusion, after a careful analysis of both points of view, I believe that brilliant in a short life, which I consider is a challenge in order to fulfil all my dreams.

I agree with the fact that we need to do some exercise to have good health, but I disagree completely with the other question that refers to there being more important things to do. Because one day has twenty-four hours and we sleep around eight or nine. If we go to work or school, then we spend another eight hours, so we have at least eight more to complement our activities, for example, doing homework, housework, and leisure activities. Therefore, I think that it is difficult not to have time to do some exercise, I mean, a lot of people may say that they don't have enough time, but I think that what they really don't have is the desire to do some good for their body. On the other hand, we have people that really want to do some exercise, but they can't find time due to work or school, so they need to organize their time in the same way as they do at work or school. We need to recognise that we need to do some workout regularly to be healthier, and giving up those thoughts about exercise is something that only people with a lot of free time can do.

Dear Council members, I am writing to you because I have an opinion regarding the new rule for mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants. I don't think that the new rule is not a good idea. There are three reasons. First, I have no idea about the necessity of the rule. Why is it bad for people to use mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants ? Is it bad manners ? Is it noisy ? If so, why are you just going to ban mobile phones ? There are a lot of kinds of bad manners other than using it. There are a lot of kinds of noisy matters other than using it too. Nevertheless, why are only mobile phones banned ? It is not reasonable. Second, the reason why is that I often search for information by using mobile phones. I would like to use it while chatting with people on transportation and in shops and restaurants. Third, the reason why is that there is no effectiveness. How do you check if people do not use it or not ? We need a lot of money if you assign a person who is in charge of monitoring this. I would really appreciate it if you could reconsider the rule. Yours sincerely, John Smith.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that playing video games is the most common fondness of today's teenagers, moreover, it has given a lot of people employment. However, this activity is simultaneously detested by adults, since the game is a cause of great distraction. Firstly, most video games show players different useful skills, such as creativity, following instructions against the clock, and coordination. Furthermore, there are some games available in a foreign language, therefore, you might be forced to understand the words and, consequently, your brain will think more. Secondly, adults are searching everyday for an alternative to screens: one of them is doing exercise. An advantage of this activity against bits world is natural light radiation, Moreover, it moves the muscles. Finally, getting a job in the video games industry is actually quite easy. In our days, young people can have a degree in graphic design and create their own computer games, and even a translation graduate could write the script of a Nintendo video game. As a conclusion, I argue that video games are really important in our contemporary lives, since they have made a huge impact on our society. So, dear parents, you should not try to hide this art from your children.

Even though lack of exercise brings negative effects to our bodies, it is not appropriate to force students to play sports. Indeed, there are several reports and research about the negative effect caused by lack of exercise. Therefore, many articles advocate the advantages of frequent exercise and sports in magazines, newspapers, and the Internet. However, it is another story when it comes to forcing students to do exercise and play sports. The following includes other feasible ways to prevent students' health from getting worse, better ways to encourage students to exercise more, and the reason for my disagreement. First, playing sports is not the only way to maintain our health in a fair condition. In other words, having well-organized eating habits can also have an impressive effect on keeping good health. For example, calculating the number of calories in your meals, ensuring the nutrition you take in meets the daily requirements, avoiding having meals in midnight, and not touching fried meals. Second, instead of setting rules about how much they need to exercise in a week, it is more rewarding for them if there are related events, contests, or even championships. By holding a variety of sport events, the students will be interested in sport rather than being forced. Last but not least, it is possible for them that some certain ways of playing sport does not make them exercise enough. For instance, picking defensive positions in basketballs and baseballs. Not to mention those who have got no interest in these sports try to find a cozy spot for themselves and watch the whole game without moving much. In conclusion, I do agree that people refusing to have a proper exercising habit will eventually lead them to have a body with deteriorating health. But it is also necessary to find a flexible way for students to enjoy sports, instead of forcing them to do so for their own good.

My favourite season of the year. I would say I love all the seasons, but if you are asking me for a favourite season, I would say autumn. Autumn is a season of colour. Its colours change its appearance. Especially the red eyebrows and the yellow beard, the exquisite purple eye, and a pink smile. Actually, this is not the real reason that I love autumn. There is a story behind it. I still remember that year in late spring, when I was only 6. My parents took me to my grandparents' farm in the countryside. It was very boring in those days, because there was no WiFi or internet. I had nothing to do for days. One day, when I was playing in the barn with some nuts, something in the corner caught my eye. It was a squirrel. It was watching me. I looked at it, it looked at the nuts in my hands. I threw one to him. He caught it and ran away fast. About 2 minutes later, I saw him arriving again, this time, with 2 more squirrels! I started to have fun with them. What brings me together with autumn is animals. I love animals, they are adorable, too.

For long time, in almost all schools, the students are required to do volunteer work. This kind of work allows students to obtain some experience, but there are not many places which want to give opportunities to young people or do not offer a healthy atmosphere for them. Firstly, voluntary work has always been a requirement to graduate from any high school or university. As a student this kind of work allows students to get experience, teenagers are able to apply knowledge that they have obtained from the school and they have a better idea about how working life is. However, for students to select a volunteer job is not always easy. The range of options for this kind of job is sometimes limited, the timetables are not comfortable, as a volunteer the student does not receive a salary and some companies exploit the students. To sum up, voluntary work will always be an excellent option for students to get experience, but as something necessary to be able to graduate, schools should research for good options of volunteer jobs to offer to their students.

Following the recent and dramatic development of the Internet, schools have to update their way of teaching. The question at hand is: should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? On the one hand, substituting books with tablets could be very useful for students. As a matter of fact, the books that students carry are generally numerous and heavy. It is consequentially harmful for students' backs. Moreover, tablets could make the learning more entertaining: there are usually a lot of animations, it is quite fun for the students to discover them. On the other hand, tablets are not flawless. Indeed, they present a major impact on a student's vision. It is not healthy to stay in front of a screen all day long. Another point to consider is whether tablets are really reliable. Sometimes, tablets may cut out or the Internet could stop working. Besides, using tablets significantly increases the risks of cyber-bullying. Of course, a contrary opinion might be that students are grown up enough to behave like adults. To put it in a nutshell, even though tablets are handy, they can be hazardous if they are used on a daily basis.

Many new electronic products are invented these days. It is not special to see people, even children, using computers at home and tablets in public places anymore. Since these electronic devices are commonly used, and network technology is quite steady, schools start thinking about letting students use computers and tablets for learning instead of papers and textbooks. In my opinion, e-learning should be totally adopted in schools. First of all, replacing books with tablets is environmentally friendly. Books are made of paper and some contain plastic, and people have to cut down trees to make paper. Then there is less fresh air produced and the soil will also loosen without being consolidated by tree roots. Abandoning books that contain plastic will pollute the environment as it is not easy to be degraded in nature. Compared to paper, which affects the environment, electronic devices cause less damage to nature as we wouldn't throw devices away frequently. One must not forget that tablets and computer are easier and more effective to learn with than books. Tablets and computer can store as many documents as you need to study. All we need to do is find the location of the document and open it. We can also use them to watch educational videos to have fun while learning. If paper is used, it is difficult for us to find a worksheet in a pile of notes. Additionally, there is no video in textbooks, only printed pictures for us to take a look at. It is less interesting and effective than using an electronic device. In conclusion, I think that schools should take advantage of modern technology in education. They are fantastic tools to learn and acquire knowledge with as they can broadcast video and have huge storage. They also save the planet at the same time by reducing deforestation and air pollution. Therefore, I agree that computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities.

INTRODUCTION The aim of this report is to explain what I want to achieve in this new school year and to sort out what I will do to accomplish my goals in the future. AREAS OF MY LEARNING THAT I AM PLEASED WITH Firstly, I want to highlight areas that I am glad with, such as literature, music, and history, as while I am studying them I find them very rewarding. In spite of saying that, art is an outstanding subject as I totally fall in love with it every time I am in class, and also seeing that when I go to a museum I can understand pictures perfectly well. AREAS OF MY LEARNING THAT I WANT TO IMPROVE Nevertheless, it is absolutely important to mention areas that I want to improve seeing that not all things are flawless. For example, subjects such as maths, physics, and chemistry, seeing that they are too complex for me as I don't understand anything and I feel very frustrated when I study them. However, I want to improve them as I totally believe that I could understand them. THINGS THAT I WILL DO TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS In the long run, it would be very profitable for me to watch tutorials, as I might understand maths and physics better than now. Besides that, I will work very hard to accomplish it.

My favourite season of the year is summer because I like it when it's warm outside. It's the time when everybody is going on holiday. I can visit my parents, my friends, and fly somewhere abroad. It's my dream to fly to an exotic island, somewhere where it is nice, just sea and blue sky. Last summer, I was sick and it was the first year of the pandemic so I didn't have real holidays, I spent only a couple of days with my boyfriend not far from home. This year I'm not sure I can afford any trip, maybe into the mountains. I love climbing in summer. Autumn is good too. In spring it is too cold for this kind of activity. I'd like to change my job, so I probably won't be able to go somewhere for a long time. I remember the time we were visiting Greg in Barcelona. It was a little cold, around twenty four degrees when we were on the beach because the cold wind blew. Soon we're planning a trip to the U. S. A. I can't wait for that. Oh, summer holidays!

Hi Robert, I would like to mention in this e-mail that my favorite activity that I do in my free time is watching movies. My favorite film is "A Clockwork Orange," which is directed by Stanley Kubrick. Most of the readers of the book do not like this movie since the film and the book are not exactly the same. However, I can say that the film is actually excellent for me. There are many small details and cool things that nobody can easily notice. Besides these, the film music is composed meticulously. Also, the camera angles are adjusted in a very professional way. Therefore, if you did not watch it yet, I would strongly suggest you not miss it. Sincerely, Kıray

I think being healthy is more important than being rich. I have been sick for the last two years, all the money in the whole world doesn't matter when you're in unbearable pain. First, I had a benign brain tumor. Before surgery it had hurt so badly I wanted to cut off my head. After surgery, half of my face was paralysed. Actually, it's been over two years since the tumor was cut out of my brain, and I'm still not in the shape I used to be. When I was visiting my doctor, he said that I still had something in my head. Something else. It turned out that I needed more surgery. This time it was a malicious tumor, a glioma. After I left the neurosurgery department, my condition required radiotherapy and after that chemotherapy. I was lucky that my insurance covered all the bills. Some people aren't so lucky and then they need huge sums of money for their treatment. That is a reason for spending your money. So yes, money is also important, but health is the most important.

Music is an important part of our life. For sure, everyone has contact with music everyday - on TV, on the radio, in the Internet, on our phones. we learn about music in every school level from kindergarten to high school. However, in some schools, learning music isn't required. For me, it's good, because not everybody has to learn music. At the beginning I want to say that not everyone has a talent for music - to play an instrument or sing. Obviously, it's normal. We all are different, we know and do things otherwise so not everyone has to know music well. What's more, lots of people are shy. In that case, they may have problems with learning music because they are ashamed that they have to play or sing publicly. To be honest, I am an excellent example of that. I learnt music at primary school and it was really challenging for me. I was incredibly shy - I sang very quietly and I was nervous when I had to play something. Because of that I was scared before every music classes. And that's not a point! Music classes should be calm and stress-free. So you see, not everybody has to learn music at school. I truly believe that even if we don't learn it, all of us have enormous contact with music. And I'm sure it teaches us more than normal classes at schools.

Someone might argue that exercise is important for our health. I hear what they are saying. However, I believe that there are more important things. I have three things. First, it is important to sleep enough. Based on some research, if you do not get enough sleep, the positive effect for health decreases. That is because the growth hormone is generated a lot in deep sleep. Second, it is important to ingest good nutrients too. After exercising, muscles need to recover. Then it is necessary to ingest good nutrients. For example, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, we need to ingest good nutrients for our good health and mind. Third, it is important to be relaxed. I believe that it is most important compared to the other things above. It might be good for health to get a little stress. However, generally speaking, stress is bad for our health. And relaxation is good for getting rid of stress. So it is better to create a good situation in which we are able to be relaxed. To summarize, it is important for our health to exercise. In addition, it is important to sleep enough, ingest good nutrients, and be relaxed too.

When I was child, I saw my grandparents, who are French people, and admired how they could, even if they were poor, live deeply in happiness. I asked my grandfather all the time in order to discover the key to his happiness. He explained to me that the reason was very simple: enjoying what you do. Even if this advice was very simple, I am highly convinced that it is the secret of living well and happily. Due to those statements, I think it is interesting to live in harmony within our community, which leads us not only to live longer but to live also happily and proudly. I know the fact that life is hard and very exhausting but enjoying what we do in our life must help us to live in peace with our own life and lead us to reach our goals and dreams easily. I saw many cases in my family, as well as my relatives, who lived a shorter life but much more intense. It was their choice to live like this but I am highly convinced that they never enjoyed their life because they lost peace and happiness. To summarize my opinion, I insist that I hope I will be able to live a long and calm life until 100 years old or even 120 years old but I insist the secret of success is happiness.

Computers and tablets should take over the role of books in academic institutions. Electronic devices provide a much greater use than printed materials. For instance, they update information faster, store greater quantities of data, and permit access to the Internet for further research, contrary to the essential limitations of traditional means of storing information. It is also observable that for such convenience, in modern times, books no longer retain their appeal to readers as they used to, which is witnessed by the drastic decrease in book sales. Therefore, computers and tablets are bound to replace the hard copies of texts in schools and universities. Replacing manuals with high-tech devices in education facilities is a risky choice for the fact that it requires exhaustive financial resources to purchase these appliances. In Vietnam, a similar proposition was introduced to the National Congress, but was denied for costing half of the national development budget to initiate such transformation without any definite guarantee for its results. In conclusion, modern technological devices such as tablets and computers should not be encouraged to be present as the main storage of information in schools and universities.

For years, schools have designed different methods of study, many of them have included extra classes such as singing and music. Research shows that such classes are beneficial for students, but not all schools have these classes for their school population. The advantages of learning music have been shown by research. For instance, it is known that if children practice dance or how to play any musical instrument, they improve their academic performance. In addition, for children in their early ages, a musical education stimulates brain zones which allows development in these areas: cognitive, emotional, motor, affective and linguistic. Some institutions have included music education as a compulsory subject because of its benefits. However, not all schools have the necessary tools to provide this type of education. In conclusion, the advantages of having a musical education are obvious, there is research and evidence to support the results. That is why governments should invest to improve the infrastructure and be able to offer a better education.

Television was originally invented for severing the entertainment purpose for people in the industry time. However, the content of television is gradually changing and is offering various choices to serve distinctive needs. Nowadays, the content is designed to support learning purposes, especially for children were accounted for 20 percentages. Many channels embark childhood development by intervening knowledge with entertainment that is displayed through cartoons to attract children's attention.

In a succinct conclusion, television entertains, but it also educates people in an effective way.

My experience with studying on the platform Write and Improve has been great and very useful. What I liked on Write and Improve is the possibility of writing several texts about many subjects, from housework to subjects about work. Another thing I liked was the correction process, the Artificial Intelligence has a good accuracy and informed me about grammatical errors that I committed and how I could correct them. I also liked the fact that Write and Improve has four levels along with their workbooks. These four levels are beginner, intermediate, advanced, and business. However, Write and Improve has defects that I didn't like. An example is the failure to examine if the text I wrote matched with what the platform asked. Many times I wrote the text according to what the platform asked, but the system said that I wrote it incorrectly. After using Write and Improve, I can recommend the platform without any problems to my classmates. They will enjoy it a lot.

Nowadays, if young people want to study sometimes they have to leave their homes. There are factors which make people leave their families, but living in other places could not be easy, it is not the same to confront difficulties alone than receive support from your family. Currently, technology allows people to have access to education, many universities offer online courses and almost everyone has access to the internet, which means that you do not need to leave your home and family. However, this type of course does not always offer the same advantages as a face-to-face course, such as direct contact with teachers, material and equipment to practise. Studying close to your families is always more comfortable and cheaper, but moving to another place means that you have to become more independent and you have to overcome some situations on your own. In conclusion, despite the advantages that studying close to your family means, if you study far from them, you will be aware how real life is and gradually you will be less dependent.

Report about the new school year. In this new school year I am pleased with chemistry and physics because they are subjects that I really like. The teachers of these subjects are very good and I am going to learn a lot from them. Also at school, there are good laboratories for these subjects. The subjects I need to improve are math and English. Math is a difficult subject for me because it is very abstract and I need to study more time. On the other hand, it is a subject that complements the subjects of physics and chemistry, with mathematics being the principal topic for several subjects. English is another subject that I need to improve. I have been studying a lot, but I have always had difficulties with these subjects. I have studied with a private teacher and for my skills I have practiced on a website. To achieve my goals, I am going to practise more in the subjects that I have problems with, I am going to make a schedule because I have hour study, This way I will deal with the subjects like math and English.

My best holiday was when I went to Cancun with my family. I went with my wife and my two children to a big hotel. It had several international restaurants, like Italian, Japanese, and Spanish ones. There were also several pools for the children and adults. We also went to several place like Islas Mujeres and there we swam with dolphins and we were on the beach. What we liked most was when we were to scaret there we swam in an underground river and at night there was a show about Mayan culture. We ate while we saw the show, it was really beautiful. We also went to another place, its name was Xelha, but the most impressive one was an archaeological site because we saw how the Mayans lived and we learned that their culture was impressive. I think that this was our best holiday and we are waiting for the moment to go again.

Television entertains, but can it also educate? Many people love to watch TV, so do I. Sometimes people watch TV for 2 reasons. The first is to entertain, the second is to know. We entertain ourselves when we are tired, stressed, or bored. We choose a show and enjoy it. We also study with TV. Many people think that reading everything in books is boring and prefer to watch some TV to study. Both are acceptable. But which is which? It depends. It depends on the shows and the people. Entertainment shows will only entertain, but some educational shows will indeed be a great help. Shows like 'BBC Animals' and scientific shows are all useful. It also depends on the people who are watching them. If a person that likes to think watches an entertainment movie, he will also think about the movement and the actions in the shows. But if a person does not like to think and just watches whatever is on the show, give him to watch an outer space discovery, he will know nothing after that.

According to me, computers and tablets should not replace books in school and at university. First of all, books are a beautiful invention. They have been written by great authors, and they are real objects, which you can hold in your hand, not like e-books, which are just on your screen. Second, I think that you cannot have the same concentration with a tablet as with books. I think that working with a screen could really disturb someone who tries to study. For example, in this pandemic period, I am working all day on my computer. And that has made me realize that I'm much more concentrated in class than in front of my screen. Third, I think that replacing books with technology is really sad. Books are such a beautiful invention, where you can find stories or whatever you're searching for. They are one of the last things that are not yet created by technology. I think that it could be really disappointing to replace such beautiful things with electronic things. In conclusion, I would not replace books with computers.

My dearest Jane, I hope you are doing well. Sorry for answering so late, I have been really busy recently. Anyway, I went to the movies a few days ago and I wish you had been there, it was fantastic. I saw a movie titled "Very Bad Trip." The plot is about a groom who was celebrating his bachelor party. Nevertheless, this party didn't go as planned. Indeed, the next morning, his witnesses couldn't find him. The bride was panicking since her fiancé was missing. During the whole movie, the witnesses were trying desperately to find him. Not only was the plot amazing but the actors were also remarkable. You should definitely watch it! I can't wait to hear from you. All the best, Ella

Fifty years ago, it was very difficult to imagine a net of daily flights from different European countries to New York or Singapore. Today, this is normal information that an average ten - year - old boy can give you. And tomorrow? In my view, the process runs very fast for future improvements, so to make it easier each long journey by plane instead of by car, train or float. It will be only a question of business, then we will have a more comfortable way to travel quickly and safely, avoiding traffic and other problems related to road accidents.

People prefer to play video games more than perform physical actions. Some people think that it is a bad situation for our children. On the other hand, most children are defending the idea that there are some positive effects for them. In my opinion, if you are not playing that much, it can be enjoyable and okay. There are many tasks to do other than playing video games. Therefore, I can say that playing video games is acceptable when you are not playing the whole day. I can also say that there are no negative or positive effects on our daily life. Children are saying that their perception skills improve dramatically when they are playing video games. However, if you are not playing a real coordination game, you cannot evolve that much with shooting games. Finally, most video games are not like those "Blue Whale" ones or have anything to do with suicide. I know that there are too many killing games, however, I can also say that they are not harmful. To sum up, video games are only for having fun, you do not have to be afraid of them.

I think it is better to have a balance between the years that a teacher has to educate students, where neither having many years with students nor having a single year with them is ideal. I believe that a teacher needs to have the time necessary to build a firm relationship with students. This relationship with students helps teachers understand the behavior and profile of students, so that the teachers can develop an education program that can improve the understanding and assimilation of content passed on to students. On the other hand, it's important for students to have a diversification of teachers teaching over the years. It's necessary because the students end up getting too comfortable with a teacher that they are already accustomed to and this can disturb their learning. Therefore, to identify a happy medium for this situation is the way to improve the learning of students and their relationship with the teachers.

The answer is they shouldn't. We mustn't replace books with new technologies. Here's why: Books are knowledge gathered by our ancestors, and they are much more valuable than gold. Nothing can replace them. Here are some points why books are treasures that human beings cannot erase. Let's talk about the benefits of reading a book. First, it lets you think about the scenery or the scene that the author is writing. It is way more helpful than reading something with pictures and being told about the setting straight away on a digital device. Secondly, it benefits your body. We all know that books are made from wood or stone. Digital devices are not the same. They will harm your eyes and brain, making you somehow unable to think properly. It's fun watching a show on TV, but it's difficult to read on a screen. It will somehow distract your concentration. It will also be tedious as your eyes will get tired and bored. However, books are not the same. Whenever you read a book, even if it is the same book, you will still find happiness and something new that you haven't noticed before.

Someone might argue that it is better for university students to live on their own while they are attending school. I agree with a part of their air gunner. That is because they are able to build their independence and make free time. However, I think that it is better for university students to live with their parents while they are attending the university on the other views. Firstly, finance. Generally speaking, university students don't make a lot of money by themselves. That's why they need to depend on their parents in many cases. So, if they live on their own, their parents need to bear the burden more in addition to the tuition. It is not reasonable for their parents. Secondly, time. If they live on their own, they need to housekeep by themselves. They need to study a lot as university students. However, those who live on their own have to spend their time a lot on other things like the housekeeping. It is not reasonable. In conclusion, I believe that it is better for university students to live with their parents.

If I have to make a choice between a long, calm life until 100 years old and a shorter life but much more interesting, I will certainly choose to live a shorter but much more intense life. First of all, I think the point of life is to discover, explore and experience. It is always of great fun to meet with new things and chat with different people while travelling. I have held this faith since I was a child that life shouldn't be completed without knowing other parts of the world apart from your hometown. By living an intense life, we may meet more difficulties than living a calm life. But we will have more knowledge about the world after that. Difficulties and happiness are both parts of a real life. Secondly, I think living a calm life is boring. With all the things you are familiar with throughout your whole life, life can sometimes be less attractive than being accompanied by different people . Sometimes we focus on the length of life too much and ignore the beauty of differences. I am more like a free person than a flexible one. Therefore I enjoy spending time on travelling and exploring. I think an intense life allows me to be able to be who I am and do whatever I am pleased with. In the end, I would like to say that I actually want a life that is both long and exciting because you never know what is waiting for you.

Visiting a zoo is one of the easiest ways to learn about animals, although some people believe that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. To begin with, I would like to mention that zoos do not keep animals that are dying out. In general, it is difficult to see animal species that are dying out in the world. Secondly, zoos are really helpful to increase our children's level of knowledge. I think that you all know what a lemur is, however, most villagers do not know those kinds of animals. The reason for this is that there are no zoos in most villages. On the other hand, some people are completely against putting animals in a zoo environment. They think that animals must live in their own habitat. If they are to be kept in a zoo, the living environment must be designed perfectly as if they live in their own special and suitable natural habitat. Lastly, I would like to say that I agree with the second approach.

In some schools, music is a required subject and all the students have to study it. However, some schools permit scholars to study or not study it. I think that music should be studied by all students. In my opinion, music should be examined in all schools and by all students because it is a beautiful subject which has a lot of benefits for us. Indeed for some people, music is a way to relax and release the stress that is accumulated during the day. It is a fantastic activity that you can do in your free time, especially when you are bored. In other words, learning an instrument is a great activity to do as it has good effects on us. Studying music is also a good method and opportunity to establish new friendships as it allows you to know more people. For instance, if you want to know more people or you are searching for friends, you can join a band or orchestra, and this can be helpful even to improve your musical skills. Music can become also a passion for you. Indeed you can develop an interest in the instrument that you are learning and it can help you to try something new and find something enjoyable. To summarise, music is a subject that should be studied in all schools because it has a great number of good effects on our minds.

As to my favourite season of the year, I would like to introduce it to you. My favourite season of the year is spring. As you know, we have four seasons in Japan. Generally speaking, spring is from March to May, summer is from June to August, autumn is September to November, and winter is December to February in Japan. I think that each season has its good points. It is cold in winter and sometimes it snows in Tokyo. Compared to the northern areas in Japan such as Hokkaido, it is much better in Tokyo, but I do not want to go out in winter because it is cold. As it is getting warm in March, I start looking forward to seeing the cherry blossom. In spring, from the end of March to the first half of April, we can see the cherry blossoms in bloom in Tokyo. I think that a landscape with the trees in full bloom is very beautiful in Japan. So I like spring, my favourite season is spring.

What is more important, to be healthy or be rich? That is the question that many people try to answer. Some people think that to be healthy you have to be rich, but it is not always true. Except when a person has the same condintion, being healthy is not linked to being rich. People have been reaching a long and healthy life, even living in underdeveloped countries. So, what has been happening in these countries? People can buy natural food or non-processed food, and this helps a lot to keep a healthy diet. Recent research shows that natural foods are healthier and cheaper than processed food. Another important thing is to eat less meat and more vegetables. People who do this live a long life. However, it is important to say, people need to save enough money for future days. Everyone knows that elderly people require specific care and it is expensive. In short, saving money and eating healthy food, less meat and more vegetables, should make you a rich and healthy person in the future.

Nowadays, learning a foreign language is not only a professional requirement but also it represents a competitive advantage in the interconnected world where we live. Furthermore, is it is well-known that English is the most useful and recognized language around the world. Bearing this in mind many people are looking for methods and tools which help them to learn English quickly and efficiently. Speaking personally, one of the best and useful tools for learners of English is Write and Improve, a free application developed by Cambridge in which every learner can practise her or his writing in order to improve her grammar and fluency. Moreover, this application gives a topic and some questions or points to develop in the text, after that one can write the text according to a certain number of words required. Then there's a check button which automatically gives an evaluation and feedback of the writing, which comes up with some symbols so as to correct some mistakes or to improve some parts. Additionally, this platform is mainly about writing essays, emails, letters and proposals, as well as writing in formal and informal ways. Apart from that, this marvelous tool has different difficulty levels such as beginner, intermediate, advanced and business level which are customizable, thus one can choose one's own level according to the English level of each person, so as to start with an appropriate level and go up the level of complexity until becoming the CEO of English. In addition to that, the main feature of this platform is the huge variety which is a boon for every learner so as to prepare for any English Test. Another feature is that at it gives you all the necessary feedback and an approximate level at which you probably are, this latter could be B1 or C1 or C2. However, what I most like about this app, is the amiable design to use, the guides to write and the variety of topics. After all, these characteristics are essential for a learner who wants to boost her writing skills. Despite all its benefits there are some difficulties at the beginning, such as one can struggle to find ways to be a C1 or C2. It means that once one gets a higher level, the most difficult is to get higher. Another instance could be that one learner can stressed out herself when she's run out of ideas to develop within the text; but nobody says it was easy to learn and get better in a target language. So, it would appear this platform has its benefits and some challenges, nonetheless I highly recommend this platform for all learners who are seeking a tool to write faster and better.

My favorite season of the year is autumn. I have four reasons to support this idea. First of all, we can obtain good foods in this season. We can get a lot of crops, like rice, fruits, fish, and vegetables. These ingredients can be used to make delicious dishes. These dishes will keep us in better physical condition. Secondly, the climate is conducive to exercise. The fall is not too hot or too cold to move our bodies. If you play some sports, autumn is more suitable than any other season. I also like to play tennis, and I can play well in this season. The probability of getting injured is the lowest in the year. Thirdly, we can study very well in the fall. The climate also gives us the best condition to read books or learn something. It is easy for us to concentrate to start learning. The quality and efficiency of learning might be improved in this season. The final point is that I have a birthday in November, so I used to get birthday presents from my parents. This autumn season has some touching memories. I was given board games as birthday presents, and my parents and I played the games together. We enjoyed the games and it allowed us to maintain good communication and valuable relationships. In conclusion, I think autumn is the best season to start a new challenge in terms of climate. Thus, I love this season.

I believe you really should watch it. Once you said to me you like to watch crazy movies, right? So, as I described to you, this movie fits your description of the movie you would like to watch.

I think that we have the same problem in Japan. Most medical doctors want to work in cities to earn more money. As the result of this trend, there are not enough doctors in many rural areas. I think that there are some reasons for this problem. One is that there is a regulation that doctors are not allowed to see a patient through internet in Japan. In Japan, we have to see a doctor face to face, doctors can't see a patient through internet due to the regulation. If the regulation was changed, doctors could see a patient through internet. I think the problem will be solved to some extent. Wherever we live, we can choose a doctor and see the doctor through internet as a first step. If the regulation is changed, it will be easier for doctors to live in cities. Second is that it is very expensive to be a doctor in Japan. In Japan, if you want to be a doctor, you have to study in a medical university for 6 years and have to be qualified for the medical license by the government. Unlike public medical universities, the private medical universities' cost is expensive, I think that it is necessary to pay about 5 to 10 thousand dollars per year. I think it is difficult for ordinary people to pay such high costs. So I think that if there are more scholarship funds, enough to increase the number of new doctors, the problem will be solved to some extent.

Yes, it is. I think that English is as important as other languages. English is the best all around the world. I like learning English very much. When I was a small boy I learnt English at school. We were learning English with a great teacher, Joseph. He had prepared a lot of fun things for better learning. He was a great teacher and I had the same 1 grades. And then it was horrible. In secondary school we had a lot of English teachers. They changed during the year. They were teaching us too little about some things. years I see a big difference. I am glad that I am learning English by myself. Every day, again and again. I would like to have a B2, the First Certificate. I will pass the exam. I will have passed next month. I will have been speaking with the British Council. We will see. I was learning English. I am learning English. I am going to learn English. English is my life now. I want to be better every day. Thank you for your attention. Tom

Do you believe that school is dull and should be reformed ? Well, education has long been a bone of contention. That's why, I would like to present you several aspects of school that in my opinion will evolve in the future. Let's travel one century forward! First and foremost, the first point I would like to raise is that schools will adapt the courses for each student. As a matter of fact, it is nowadays challenging when at high school to know exactly which occupation we want to do. That's why, students will have the opportunity to follow multidisciplinary lessons, which include sciences, arts, music, technology, languages, and literature. Afterwards, in year 12 they will have to choose several subjects they would like to refine in order to prepare their studies in college. Another thing to consider is whether the students will keep being evaluated with marks. Actually, it is universally acknowledged that it is stressful to receive marks for a worksheet. Consequently, a lot of teachers have been thinking about another type of evaluation, with colors. Red if the skill is not mastered, orange if the skill is currently being learned and green if the student has perfectly fulfilled the expectations. One cannot disregard that marks are not always representative of a student's level. The main goal of those reforms is that students arrive at school in high spirits, willing to learn. To put it in a nutshell, not only will school adapt its courses but it will also support the students better in their career. What about you ? Tell us about your vision of schools in the years to come.

High school requirements are strict in many aspects. One of them is the volunteer programme, this kind of requirement could be a remarkable opportunity to learn and gain experience from a different kind of work. Nevertheless, this activity can be tedious to students because they have to deal with school stuff and the responsibility of doing this volunteer programme. Sometimes they do not have enough time to develop their activities properly because they have after school activities such as sports clubs or any other type of activity. Anyhow, I think a volunteer programme is necessary for students to have the experience to work in the community. They have the opportunity to get to know different environments, to know different life-situations in life. Students can also discover what they want to do in their life and what they want to study at university. For those reasons, I think volunteer work to graduate is a tedious but necessary thing to do to graduate because there are many benefits from it.

My reasons for learning English We live in a globalized world, where all things and people are connected to each other. Communication can be hard if you know only your mother tongue. So, knowing a global language such as English is extremely important to be heard and to be understood. Because of that I decided to learn a new language and I chose English. All people that are playing a role on a global scale use English to communicate with each other. When I noticed this, immediately I started to study English and it became a daily challenge. Studying and learning English is important to me because I want to live overseas one day. I am aware that if I don't master English, I will have problems when faced with any situation in which that language is necessary. So, in short, people in the globalized world need English and, whether I know it or not, global positions will still exist. So, I chose to learn.

I think that video games are positive for children. Playing video games improves the logical reasoning of children and further develops the creativity and imagination of children. Logically, children must be monitored by parents for the time that they spend playing video games. When children spend a lot of time playing video games, that what is positive and an advantage ends up turning negative because the children will have difficulty at school and in their social life. For example, my parents always set some rules that I needed to follow, such as only playing video games if I had finished my homework. This was working and I got good grades in school and yet I had time to play video games. Another observation that the parents need to make is to observe the games that their children are playing. They must avoid that children play violent and sexual games. With the follow-up of parents, children can develop many positive attributes in their growth through video games.

There are some advantages of studying abroad. Firstly, students are able to learn the language of the other countries. The options for a job will be expanded. Secondly, they are able to learn about diversity. It is important to experience this with globalization. Thirdly, they are able to make foreign friends. They will be the great treasures in their lives. On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages of studying abroad. Firstly, it might be difficult for someone to fit in with other cultures. Secondly, they might feel stressed. Many of them are not able to talk with people smoothly because of different languages. Thirdly, they need to be away from their local friends and families. They are not able to spend time with their friends and families instead of staying in the other countries. That is all I would like to explain about the advantages and disadvantages regarding studying abroad.

The recent technological changes in society have brought up an interesting discussion regarding the complete disregard of books in schools. In my opinion, we should get rid of all the books in schools and universities with regard to learning and I will explain why. Books contain pure magic. They tell stories and enable us to practise empathy. However, the main goal of books in education is not the magic, but the knowledge they contain. On top of that, there are some incredible benefits to using technology in schools. Digital learning aids are able to correct a student's work, saving the teachers a lot of time. Some technologies are even able to send students to an exercise that best fits their current level of learning, enabling personalized learning. I therefore believe that books should always be in schools, but not as a means of learning.

I think that it is effective for me to work in the offices which there are no walls separating employees from other colleagues. In Japan, most Japanese companies have this kind of office, where there are no walls separating employees from other colleagues. For me, I already got used to working in non-separated offices. Because I have to cooperate with my colleagues to do business, it is convenient for me to work in non-separated offices. I think that one of the merits for not separating offices is to be able to communicate with each other whenever you want. On the other hand, if people work by themselves, I think it is effective to work in enclosed workstations. I think that people who basically work by themselves, such as a researcher, investment analyst or consultant, they get used to working by themselves. If they work in offices where there are no walls separating them from each other, I think it is not effective for them because they can't concentrate on their work.

Recently I've discovered a very useful tool for those who are keen to improve their writing English. This tool is called Write and improve. It allows you to write about hundreds of topics, which you can choose freely. Everyone will find something for them! As I said by using this tool you are able to improve your English skills. You just simply write about a certain topic and when you feel you have finished, you send the answer. After some time you get your feedback from Cambridge! Then you can either make some changes to improve your work or move on to another topic. For sure the best part about this tool is that you can get some feedback and continue to improve. Another thing worth mentioning is that you don't have to check your work by yourself! In a short period of time you can write multiple tasks. It doesn't matter, if you are currently travelling by train or bus. The Write and Improve allows you to write from every device that you own (it has to be connected to the internet)! When it comes to downsides, it may take a long time before your work gets some feedback. Another problem is that it also has a limited amount of topics on which you can write. Just imagine a situation when after some time you have finished all of the available tasks and there is nothing left. At least after finishing all of the tasks, I believe you will be able to express your opinion about any topic easily.

In general, people think that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. There is a classic saying about the importance of taking care of your health, "no one can buy a healthy body with their money." Firstly, I can say that your health is more important than being rich. Therefore, we should be aware of how critical our health is. If you have a healthy body, you can live without any pain in your daily life. Besides that, to be healthy is also important for a longer life. In addition to this, being healthy is not free and this can be very expensive sometimes. Therefore, sometimes we need to pay a lot of money for our health and being rich is important in that sense. If you are rich, you can live an easy life, however, you cannot choose your diseases and the pain levels of your health problems. Finally, I can say that being healthy is the important thing in our life since we are living in our bodies and we should be careful about them.

Studying in another country has many advantages for students. Students can learn things that are a trend in the world. For example, if a Brazilian student goes to the United States, this student will learn many things that have not yet been commented on in their country. Furthermore, to study in another country has the advantage of learning another language, this being very valuable for the professional career of the student. Another advantage is the opportunity of the student to increase his networking due to the fact that this student can meet with people from different countries and professions. However, studying in another country has disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is the fact that the student needs to leave their family, a fact that can destabilize the student emotionally. Another disadvantage is the money necessary to travel and live in another country. Living in another country is expensive, even if a school or university offers a scholarship for students. In general, the opportunity of studying in another country is unique and must be taken by the student.

I think that it is an important opportunity for students to do volunteer work. I think that students can have a very valuable experiences through volunteer work. In general, I think that one of the meanings of volunteer work is to be able to contribute to a society which you belong to. For example, volunteer work such as a clean-up activity in a town. If I participate in this volunteer work, I can contribute to keeping a town clean to some extent. I think that one of the meanings of volunteer work is to be able to help others. For example, volunteer work such as a supporting handicapped people. If I participate in this volunteer work, I can help handicapped people's activity. I think that through this kind of volunteer work, I can find various things which I would not ever find. And I think these kinds of experiences are valuable for students for their life after graduation. I also think that it is difficult for students to do volunteer work by themselves. So I think a condition in which volunteer work is necessary to graduate is reasonable for me. Through volunteer work, people can obtain valuable experience which makes people grow as a member of a society.

Nowadays, most medical doctors want to work in cities, which is of course not a perfect scenario for rural areas. Let's have a quick look why it is happening and how can it be solved. The most crucial reason for this is very simple. In cities, especially big ones, they are able to earn more money. Everyone wants to be paid well. Another very key thing is that it can be tricky to get a house in rural area. It's a lot easier to rent an apartment or a house in a city, as well as often less expensive. Also they don't have to spend a lot of time to get to work, and as we all know time is very important. Who would want to spend 2 hours of their day just to get to work? There are few things which can be done to solve or minimize this important problem. Firstly, we need to reduce the time which is required to get to a doctor. We can achieve it by upgrading our roads and making more roads for bicycles. This solution will help reduce the time spent at the doctor, as well, it will increase the number of patients, which will boost their earnings. It also should create new opportunities for investors, who will build new housing for doctors and other people. Secondly, we need to show people that they don't have to wait a few weeks just to get to a doctor. By choosing a doctor from a rural area they can reduce the waiting time. It's good for both patients and doctors. Everyone benefits from it. I think that my solutions are not enough to fix the problem mentioned above, but they should easily reduce it.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion, it is helpful even for students and the same for society. We live in times where people need support, and help in any possible way. Our students will graduate and be the future professionals and by realizing volunteer work they may become better people, and our society needs professionals who, besides their knowledge, have love for humanity. In my personal experience I did a lot of volunteer work when I was studying. I went to Africa and saw people's needs in my simple way but with all my good feelings, I worked there. We really need to create a better world, and starting with students doing volunteer work may be only the beginning of something bigger, maybe our society can improve and a hope that my generation can be part of it.

Education is fundamental for humanity, and so are schools, which have a significant presence in our lives in a professional way and they have huge influence on our personal growth. As a result, as we move forward, schools need to change and improve in order to provide many more benefits to students and society. Apart from that, it is well known that this pandemic caused by Coronavirus has brought many changes in many aspects and areas of our lives, one of them is education, specifically in schools. Back in the old days, students used to learn in physical classrooms and interact with their teachers and classmates. However, because of the corona virus, nowadays, students must take classes virtually through platforms, such as Teams or Zoom. Hence, students learn through computers and they don't interact with others, which according to some studies can limit them in practising what they learn. After all, they barely show their faces or participate, in fact, they only turn their cameras on when they have to make presentations of final projects. Given this, the situation represents a challenge and at the same time an opportunity for schools to be prepared to help in the development of the students. Despite the fact that some changes are necessary, and it stands to reason that we have to adapt to the circumstances, it is not so easy. Currently schools have many challenges to face in order to not only maintain their tuition but also to keep their levels of education, so as to prepare their students in better ways. Additionally, it is important schools bear in mind the research about the academic performance of students during the quarantine, which has been made by professionals from some of the most prestigious universities. This research shows some important issues such as the fact that students don't learn in the same way because they are sat down in the same place for a long time. They can either get distracted or they get frustrated; which implies they do poorly in a virtual school. There are also some social and mental consequences. Owing to the lack of social interaction students are liable to feel isolation and they can often have negative feelings and thoughts. Not to mention the increase in academic load represents a hindrance to their education, which not only affects students but also teachers. By virtue of the latter, schools will be different in the future, in order to guarantee students' safety while they are learning. They will have larger classrooms with appropriate ventilation, they will reduce the capacity of each classroom, they will install disinfection points with antibacterial gel, and they will also develop protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. Moreover, schools in the future will have to install cameras which will facilitate students to take lessons from wherever they are. They will use more platforms to explain some topics and to reduce the workload for the teachers. Besides, schools will have to train their teachers so they will use more platforms to explain some topics and to reduce the workload to the teachers; besides schools will have to train their teachers so as give and teach better in this virtual modality. On the other hand, school might still be the same in some aspects, as for example their open spaces, their scholarships, their bathrooms, and their requirements for enrollment, among others. Definitely, schools will recreate their facilities and the way they teach, taking into account many striking features. Although the main purpose is to assure the students will get the best preparation for their future.

The way to learn other languages has plenty of obstacles. In the case of English, although it is so close in our daily routine through the products and culture from the USA, it isn't different. The learning has come through training in four abilities: speaking, listening, grammar, and writing. Computer time helps a lot to find tools that have artificial intelligence to contribute to a better and faster process in fluency. I found, recently, the Write and Improve Web site, which helps me so much to achieve this goal. The website Write and Improve English was a creation of Cambridge University.

I think there is not a hierarchy of things related to what is more important for our health. That said, there is a balance between the things that are important for our health, where those things are interrelated with each other. Besides exercise, there is mental health. Mental health is essential for our daily performance and, above all, for our social relationships. Without solid mental health, people are prone to anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, and poor performance at work. Furthermore, people with poor mental health have a negative perspective about their future. People succumb to the lack of planning and they can't be successful in their lives. To improve their health, people need to meet the equilibrium between mental health and physical health. For this, people can do exercise before or after work to improve their physical health, and people can meditate early in the morning, practise a hobby on the weekend, or they can spend a day with their family to recharge their energy and to improve their mental health.

I think that it is better for university students to move away and live on their own. I think that it is necessary for university students to be independent. Different from high school students, university students have to choose what they study in a university, so they should do everything independently. If you live on your own, you have to do by yourself whatever you need every day, such as making own bed, making meals, cleaning up your own room and purchasing goods which you need. I think that your family have supported you to live, except studying, when you live with your family as a high school student. But I think that university students are already members of society so they have to be responsible for their own activities including everyday life. I think studying is only a part of everyday life. To live on their own is a good opportunity for university students to be responsible for their own life. But I also understand that it is impossible to live on their own because of some economic reasons. Living on their own will be more expensive compared to living with their own family. From my personal experience, I lived on my own when I was a university student in Tokyo. Before that, I lived with my family so, except studying, everything was done by my family. But after living on my own, I had to cook by myself, clean up my room by myself, wash clothes by myself, get up by myself. Until I got used to doing this, it was very tough for me. But I think that this experience was very important for me to be independent. So I recommend university students live on their own as much as possible.

There was a long period of time where I watched TV like a crazy girl. Each morning, after I finished my homework, I always watched TV between 2 and 3 hours in the morning. When I watched some TV programs, I just thought they were created to make me recharge my batteries after I finished all my homework. I still remember that I had been laughing too much while I watched a play called " The Black Duck." But now, I'm older, I'm a teenager, so I've been watching some TV programs to help to improve both my knowledge and experience. That has made me change my mind about TV programs. I am learning how to become a good teenager. Some of my friends said they don't get along with their parents, sometimes they shout at their mom and dad. They asked me how to make them become normal.

Dear Sir or Madam of the town council, As of recently the town council has been taking a bill into consideration which would ban the use of mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. I believe this not to be a wise decision seeing as this may have unforeseen consequences if it would come to pass. because of this I have decided to outline a number of them so that the council may make an informed decision. First of all, the banning of mobile phones in public transport will not stop the use of mobile phones unless it becomes the responsibility of the drivers to enforce this regulation. Second of all, the restaurants will be put in a difficult situation. either they lose most if not all their business customers or they turn a blind eye to the use of mobile phones. Moreover, even if restaurants would want to enforce the ban, who would tell the customer? Certainly not the waiters and waitresses who depend on the customers goodwill to survive. A similar situation is to be expected in shops. Third of all, this will drive any visitors to the town away in mere minutes. As seen above all the issues stem from how to implement the ban not from how the people will react to it. If the question of implementation is not addressed adequately, then the ban may as well not exist seeing as no one would enforce it then. I sincerely hope you take my points into consideration when felling your decision.

Speaking personally, this new year means a new beginning for me to set new goals and shoot for the stars in different aspects of life. Among those there's school; hence I hence I come up to think and reflect about my performance at school. Therefore I have determined that I want to work on different areas in order to be an exemplary student and learn even more. First of all, I have identified areas of my learning that I'm pleased with, such as chemistry, maths, and science. I regard myself really good at them. Moreover, I enjoy learning about maths and science. As a result, I'll keep my study habits in those areas in order to get better and to be part of the honor roll, which has been a personal goal for a long time. So those habits are the following: solve extra math problems every time that I have problems to learn a new methodology, enroll myself in the science workshop which is given every semester by the best teachers at school, and not only will I aim to go to the library to do my homework but also to study with friends to receive feedback and learn other ways of doing things. On the other hand, I have to admit I want to improve in some areas of my learning, such as English and German in which I've been struggling since last semester. To tell the truth, I think languages are incredible and can open doors to awesome opportunities in life. Bearing the latter in mind, I want to improve and make languages a boon to my professional career. So this brings up the need to prepare and plan some actions to do in the short and middle term so that I will be able to achieve my goals in this new year. For me the gist of the matter is that I have to practise my speaking and listening. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, so every day I will listen to a podcast and a lecture in English and a lesson in German. Furthermore, another action that I must perform is to have virtual calls with some friends who know how to speak German and English. It is highly probable that they have a higher level than me, although the higher the better. Owing to this, I will feel the pressure to try harder, but at the same time I will feel more inspired to learn more and to not give up. Apart from that, I will program some test every two weeks in order to evaluate my progress and to be able to evaluate my action plan. I mean , see if I have to modify something or implement more activities. Finally, this is just an overview of my plans to develop in this year. I have tried to give a summary about the areas of my learning that I'm pleased with and others I want to improve, and make them public to others. In that way, I will get the best of school and surely I can shoot for the stars, because according to some research you are liable to be more persevering to achieve your goals once that you have made a public commitment to meet your goals.

Although video games are not one of my favourite pastimes, I know they are very popular with children of all ages. It seems that children from the richest countries have the strongest interest in them, and the bulk of their time is spent with them. This is an attitude that makes people worried and comprehensively angry. What parents are afraid of is their children's incapacity to socialise with others; this means that children will run the risk of becoming isolated adults and what is more threatening is the inability to find a good job. I consider it a serious problem that involves not only children but the entire society. I disagree with those who think that video games could have some beneficial effects, unless we are referring to some mental diseases where video games are suggested as a therapy. In general, they are a useless pastime, in spite of children feeling video games make themselves at home. As I see it, there some side effects such as the risk of suffering from long isolation that in the most serious cases could turn into a mental disease like depression. Unfortunately, there is an ever-increasing number of people that need a psychologist to recover from their bad mental state. Another delicate issue that we should not forget to treat is the large amount of violence that children experience through video games. The point that all scientists agree on is children's difficulties to make a difference between reality and playing, and they think life can be a shop window like a video game. To the best of my knowledge, video games have never made people more clever and the concerns of society should be addressed to prevent children from overusing them.

Nowadays, zoos are the places where families pass the bulk of their time because they are under the misapprehension that their children can learn about nature and animals. This is a false impression because when you want to learn about animals you have to see them in their natural environment. What I mean is that animals living in a zoo are tame, and you cannot learn anything interesting. To the best of my knowledge when a family gets to travel around an animal's real environment, they learn much more than they do in a zoo. In a zoo there are only a few animals and you cannot see how they behave, for example, when they are in a herd. Seeing three or four animals is just a drop in the ocean; you will see how much more exciting it is to study animals in their natural environments. For example, a group of tigers are hunting zebras and smaller animals in a huge field; this is something impossible to see in a zoo. Another remarkable point stressed by environmentalists is that animals are not well treated in a zoo and they suffer living in small cages. In other words, animals need the benefits of living in the wild. In spite of some proposals to enlarge the cages and the zoo area, these optimistic statements do not persuade those who want to see animals free in a forest.

Nowadays, every company has an office. In some offices, employees work in open workstations. Other offices have an enclosed design - they are usually older ones. In my opinion, the very first way, which is also newer, is a better choice for a modern office. Just think about it. Everyone wants to work in a place where there are no walls separating employees from their co-workers, no matter of the position in which they are - everybody can be accessed easily. Another very important thing is that it allows them to people feel like they are in their own houses. Because of that, they are simply more cozy. Further going, due to reduced stress, people are more efficient and they are more likely to do their tasks correctly. It is a perfect example of a win-win situation. Employers are happy because, workers are doing their work right and employees are happy, because they are not stressed at all. Unfortunately, this type of design has some downsides too. There are jobs in which you have to be precise. In those scenarios, people have to be focused, so it might not be optimal to have an open designed office. It's for sure easier to achieve when you are in an enclosed, quiet workstation.

In some offices, employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design, in which there are no walls separating the employees from their co-workers. Both settings have advantages and disadvantages, so in this essay, I would argue that enclosed workstations are better, because it gives more space and privacy that employees need in order to function more efficiently. In addition, offices with an enclosed arrangement can allow workers to work in a more organised way, and it can also prevent workers from talking to each other during work time; and that will improve work outcomes. However, offices with no walls separating employees can promote instant interactions between employees, at the same time, it could be distracting for employees; which may result in reduced efficiency and productivity in work. Finally, offices with enclosed workstations are much more convenient than those with open design, because it promotes organisation, discipline and efficiency in the workplace, unlike open settings in which workers may get distracted by each other; which may result in decreased productivity in work.

Music is plays a vital role in our wellbeing. In some schools it is compulsory for students to learn and play a musical instrument, while in other schools, there may be no music at all. In this essay, I will argue that music is important for students but it shouldn't be a compulsory. I believe music must be taught in schools, because it is a common communication language between communities around the world, and it is also known for its psychological effects such as relieving stress, anxiety and fears. It is scientifically proven that music can be used as supporting treatment for some neurological disorders (e. g. Parkinson disease). Furthermore, music plays a vital role in almost everyone's life. Some people listen to music to relieve stress or remember good moments in the past; such as times spent with friends and family members. Music itself can be a gift for humanity, and we should appreciate it by teaching students how to play musical instruments; because that promotes their self-confidence and allows them to express themselves through music. I highly recommend music should be taught to school students in their early years, because it will promote their self-confidence and help build their personalities.

Some university students live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family. I think living on your own as university student is much better than living with your family while you are studying. I think so, because students at university level should learn to be independent in their life matters, because as we get older we sometimes tend to be far away from our families; so we need to learn how to deal with that without them. Life is so hard sometimes, so we need to learn how to handle the problems that we face along the course of life. As university is the final stage of education, and it is said to be transformational stage in which students' mentality will grow to become more independent. So, in this important stage of life, students tend to expose themselves to different environments and form new relationships with others and interact as adults. While living on your own as university student has many advantages, living with your family during university can also be a good alternative, specifically for young or minor students under the age of 19 years old, whose life experience isn't enough to deal with life's struggles alone. In conclusion, I would say it is better for university students to live on their own for some time away from family to learn how to deal with life's problems , but for young or minor students it is safer for them to live with family members while they are studying.

Hi Chris, It is a really wonderful to go with you to the Bee museum. There are two choices of how to get there, you can take a train from Sue's to the museum or come to my home to go with us in our car. We will enjoy the trip together. The museum shows how bees work and produce honey. Also, you will be seeing the bees kingdom system with the queen, workers and eggs which grow up inside the beehive. So much knowledge about the hard process to get a spoonful of honey! It is necessary to put on gloves and glasses to protect yourself from their bites. See you on Saturday my friend, take care.

According to a study by the Oxford University, every third child worldwide between six and twenty is overweight. Caused by the inactive lifestyle many young people have today, this shocking number is the indicator for the plan to force university students and school children to do a sporting activity at least 3 times per week. As the options for children and teenagers to do recreational activities without having to move are innumerable, the motivation to be active is accordingly low. Therefore it is necessary to take action, by enforcing physical activity in the weekly schedule of students. Firstly, it is important to argue that this plan is preventing our modern society from a dangerous and unhealthy development, since the obesity of young children can have grave effects on their health. To only mention a few, diabetes, cardiovascular problems and cancer are illnesses caused by the consequences of being overweight. But this does not only take a toll on the person concerned, but also on the health system. Having to increasingly pay for the medical aid of children and teenagers, the health system is not equipped to endure any more stress. The only way to help, is therefore to force children to do sports. Equally important is the following argument, concerning the impact sport has on the mental health of students, since sporting activities not only allow children and teenagers to move, which releases the hormone dopamine, but also enables them to spend time with their peers. Research shows that activities in groups can additionally have positive effects on the students' grades and helps them learn important social skills, such as teamwork and fair play. As a result, the children and teenagers become happier and better members of society. In conclusion, it is important to enforce sports in the students' weekly schedule, as it not only improves their mental and physical health, but also because it has a great impact on the functionality of society.'

A lot of high schools nowadays require students to complete some volunteer activities. They are necessary in order to graduate. Like everything, this practice is not perfect. In my honest opinion, this practice is not a good solution, so I think it shouldn't be practiced. It's just not good for students. There are few reasons why I think this way. First of all, everyone is different. Not everybody enjoys having a conversation with strangers. So, some tasks may be stressful for them. I'm that kind of the person too. It's terrible to force someone to do something that they don't want to do and don't feel good about doing it. Just imagine a situation that you are forced to clean toilets after other people which you don't even know. I'm pretty sure that no one would enjoy and like it. It's that simple. There are more reasons why I think this practice is not optimal. People who are forced to do something may not do it correctly. If they do something wrong, they can cause some hard problems. For example, this situation may happen when someone is helping an older person and they give them too many pills. It's probably lethal for this person. Not only they will be dead, but more importantly it will probably cause some serious mental illnesses for the volunteer, because they were forced to do something that they didn't want to do.

Learning to speak a foreign language today is more important than it was in the past. Over the years, the world has changed and become globalized. All kinds of businesses have converged to speak a common language, in this case, English. It doesn't matter in which part of the globe you are, there will always be a person who speaks English and this is good. The labor market wants employees and candidates for a position to be able to communicate with the world in high-level English. It didn't happen in the past. People could get a job easily without knowing English. However, it has been changing since the businesses reached this global position. They are located in several countries, each one with different languages. So, knowing a foreign language is not a luxury today , but it is a need. Even if you want to acquire new knowledge, you will be asked for a foreign language.

It is a very interesting topic. I went to primary school twenty years ago. We had only paper books and it was enough for us. Today is another world. New technologies are the most grow up all around the world. Children can study with more opportunities than we could before. I had only paper, a pencil, and a pen. I went to school very happily because we did not know anything else. Today we have a lot of devices, for example, a desktop computer, notebook, and smart phone. I am very glad that we can use these devices for a better life. I do not think that paper books will replace technologies. I am reading both paper books and electronic books. We should go with today's era. Schools and universities are modern buildings and people have to use new things there. I will have children and I will want to use new notebooks. I will buy a new computer for my home next week. I will use this device a lot. I will have been using a lot this device. We have to be better for our future. Do not stop.

Nowadays, it is well know that having the same teacher for several years is stunning. However, I absolutely believe that it is better to have new teachers each year for the following reasons. Although it is absolutely essential that if you have new teachers, you will learn other ways of learning skills and also of improving your current knowledge in a great way. As a result of that you would improve your skills in the long run. Nevertheless, it is strongly necessary to emphasize that if you have new teachers each year, it will be very profitable for you as you can set up new relationships with your teachers. So, you will be more encouraged to learn awesome knowledge. Last but not least, getting outstanding marks should be mentioned, since your new teachers are going to teach you harder with the aim of you getting wondrous marks, thus it would be very profitable for you in the future. In conclusion, I totally believe that having new teachers would be absolutely beneficial for students as they could learn other ways of learning wonderful skills, set up flawless relationships with their teachers, and are going to have most out marks.

HI-TECH SCHOOL I am highly certain that in the future school will have developed awesome robots who substitute teachers. Thus classes will be more enjoyable and amusing. Also, scientists will be setting up stunning automatic doors and windows. pupils won't have to knock on the door so many times, or open windows all the time. Furthermore, school won't have books for learning as they will offer wondrous tablets for students. As a result of that they will be able to carry the material easily without weight problems. NA,. a schoolchild will have at his disposal a lot of delightful electronic lockers which have an outstanding security system for backing up students' material. Nevertheless, schools will still be the same in terms of having an amazing canteen for having lunch or a blissful playground where kids will be able to do their mischief!

In 2014, I went to Turkey for ten days for my vacation in Istanbul, the capital city of Turkey. On this trip I went with my friends and we used an airline to travel to this nice country. We had a reservation in a beautiful hotel and our reservation was for three men, and in the hotel lobby there was a big and good cafe; we had tea and coffee in it every day. We took taxis and buses when we wanted to go out and we also took the metro sometimes. We went shopping and we hung out in Turkey's forest. My friends went swimming and we used to have a nice time in the calm park that was near to our room. In my opinion, that vacation was the best holiday I ever had because we visited a gorgeous and very beautiful country of this world.

Currently, in the majority of schools students have to study music. They sometimes even have to learn how to play a musical instrument. In my honest opinion this type of requirement is not good for students. Let's have a close look why! First of all, everyone is different. Not everybody is interested in playing music, they simply might be keen on other things. It might be stressful, if they are forced to study music and/or learn to play a musical instrument, even if they don't want too. I was in similar situation back in the primary school. I had music lessons, which I didn't enjoy and I had to learn how to play an instrument, which I also didn't enjoy. More interesting is that, at the time I was keen on playing another instrument, which is the guitar. It was really satisfying for me. Another reason why not to force everyone to attend these lessons is that some people might be harmed due to high volume music and high stress. It can hardly affect their mental and physical health. It might be the reason why they might want to commit suicide. In the end I think that forcing someone to do things which they don't want to is bad and might be harmful for them.

Hey Chris, What's going on? How are you? I am already looking forward to seeing you next Saturday, when we will go to the local museum! For now, I just want to tell you the basic facts about how we are going to travel to the museum, what we can see there and what you need to bring with you. We are going to take the bus, so we can get to the museum in good time. You will need a bus ticket, but you can also buy it directly on the bus by spending about five euros. Please also take some food and drinks with you. The drinks, as well as the food, are really costly there. You should also remember to take your camera with you. Maybe you want to take some photos? The museum we are going to go into exhibits colossal skeletons of ancient dinosaurs. They are also going to exhibit fossils and stuffed animals. It seems to me it is a very interesting exhibition. I am looking forward to seeing you next Saturday! With friendly greetings, Your friend, Dieter.

Dear Mr Michael, I am writing in reference to your plan about banning the use of mobile phones in some places. As a resident in this area, I have talked with other local residents about their opinions and we would like you to know our points of view. We live in a tourist city which means that our economy depends mostly on foreign people. Tourist people want always to be able to have access to social media, they want to show where they are, what they are doing, what they eat and how they feel in specific places; that is why currently restaurants, shops, hotels, parks and public transport offer free access to the internet. This service has allowed that some places have been recognised worldwide; in consequence, if you decided to implement this law, a lot of establishments will be affected seriously. I am the owner of a restaurant and we have done research about how we would be impacted by the new law, if this law is applied, our affluence of customers will be reduced approximately by 40% of the total and probably we will have to dismiss some employees. We hope you reconsider not to implement this law in order to protect the economy of our community. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you. Best regards. Lucy Miller

The school of the future will provide more technological resources and virtual freedom to the students in the classroom. This school will be different from the present schools in aspects such as more classes for distance learning, which will decrease the barriers between geographical distances, making it possible for the students of other cities, states, or even countries to study in the schools that they have dreamt of such a lot. Certainly, the school of the future will have virtual classes, where the students will take lessons without the necessity of being present in the school. Another thing that will be present in the future is the massive use of tools that currently are avoided in the classroom, like Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and others. Of course, some things that are present currently in schools will remain in the school of the future. The face-to-face contact with a teacher will continue existing and the physical presence of students in a school will keep being an important factor of learning and the relationship between students, teachers, and schools.

Have you ever imaged your life in the future? What kind of life would you like? A calm and longer life or a shorter but intense one? Someone would choose an intense and varied life instead of a calm and stable one; on the other hand, some may prefer a steady life. The first reason is I am more likely to keep the relationship with my family and my friends. A shorter life, but much more intense, means I would not have enough time to accompany with them to create more precious memories, although I would have excitement or be proud of experimenting in my life. In addition, I am a greedy man who really desires to live longer to deeply explore this world. The last one is I usually slow down the speed of life so that I can have more time to enjoy this wonderful and beautiful world. Theoretically, I would like some intense moments or things to inspire me and make me feel more energy. As the saying goes, people need some excitement to make their life more vivid. Furthermore, an intense life attracts many people, to escape from the cycle of a boring daily life. However, if I can only choose between the two options. I would definitely choose the long calm life without any hesitation. I would not regret making the best choice for myself.

Nowadays, it is well known that television entertains, as a lot of people use it for being distracted from their tasks, but I also strongly believe that TV could also educate for the following reasons. Firstly, it is absolutely essential to say that television has educational programs, such as wildlife documentaries, stunning historical shows, and superb technological programs, which supply us with marvelous information. As a result of that, all people could really enjoy obtaining new knowledge. Furthermore, TV has kids channels, such as Clan, Disney channel, and Nickelodeon, where children could learn the alphabet and maths, as there are a lot of wondrous teachers who explain the lessons very well. So, it is a great way to learn new things. Last but not least, the daily news should be mentioned since with that we can learn about what is actually happening in the world. As a consequence of this, we can find out about recent discoveries, such as new artworks, great technological developments, and outstanding information about current wars. In conclusion, I highly consider that television can also educate because it brings blissful educational programs, awesome kids channels, and delightful daily news.

Every student must make a decision to either move away and live on their own or live at home with their family while they are studying. I think that moving away from your parents is a better choice. Let's have a quick look why I think like this! First of all, by moving away from your parents you will have to do more things than just cleaning dishes. Those things are for sure important activities which will help you in your adult life. You will also have to set your budget. Not sticking to it will be problematic and you will probably have to borrow some money. So, managing your money wisely is a very important thing in an adult life. Furthermore, you will also have to do all the paperwork by yourself. There may not be any person to help you out with it. Additionally, paying taxes is another activity which you will be supposed to do in the future. It sometimes might be tricky, but it's for sure really important and by doing so you will learn a lot. Also, you will have to find a house or an apartment on your own. All of those things and activities which I mentioned above will help you get more mature and more prepared for you future life. Remember, that in the future no one will help out you with those things.

People always have debated the importance of telling the truth. It is a subject which generates opinions crash, but we could say that there are situations where you are forced to tell lies. Personally speaking, throughout our lives we deal with a lot of situations which force us to tell lies; some people think that telling untruths is a characteristic of a bad education, but no one is exempted from inventing stories. For instance, children tell lies to their parents or teachers to avoid getting into trouble and this kind of behaviour allows parents to teach the importance and the benefit of telling the truth, as an adolescent sometimes we lie to protect our privacy or to feel free and independent. People use lies as a weapon of defence, sometimes when we cannot deal with problems on our own, and these lies can be interpreted as a call for help. On the other hand, during our development we learn the consequences of telling lies, we are aware that tell lies could get us into more serious trouble, even so, we still lie because, no matter if we are children or adults, we are afraid of what might happen, of not controlling the situations or of being harmed by a certain piece of information. In conclusion, as humans, telling lies is part of our nature, during our development we learn that telling lies could bring us bad consequences, however, sometimes we are forced to invent something to avoid problems, to protect someone or to protect ourselves.

I have recently got to know the Write and Improve website and I need to say it has been helping me a lot. Let me describe what is possible to do on the Write and Improve website. First of all, this website is divided into sections by difficulty levels. We have levels ranging from Beginner to Advanced and Business. It is possible to work in the Just for fun section as well. But the way, I'm working on the Intermediate level right now. Another section is the part where you can work on your IELTS preparation, there are two options, IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. There is a possibility to work together with a teacher and some colleagues, but I am not familiar with this part of the website. How does the website work? It is pretty simple, once you are online and have chosen a difficult level the website will give you a topic, and you need to develop a small text, sometimes it ranges from 0 to 50 words, sometimes it ranges from 140 to 200 words and after you have finished your task a robot or Artificial Intelligence will check your answers and give you feedback. This feedback will help you a lot, you can try to improve your answer and submit it again. The website gives you a score based on your performance and it is always possible to improve it. So far I have had no difficulty with Write and Improve and what I like most about this tool is the feedback. My recommendation to you is: just use it!

Nowadays, most doctors are willing to work in the cities where they will be able to earn a lot of money. And this in spite of the crucial need for doctors in many rural areas. There is obviously an issue: why are the doctors leaving the areas where they are most needed for cities and big towns, which are already full of skillful doctors ? First and foremost, doctors leave rural areas because of the conditions of work, as they feel, for most of them, underpaid and they want to make money. Therefore, those doctors will move out to towns, with a view to increasing their income by having a wider amount number of patients - a clientele that will undoubtedly outnumber the one you could ever have in a small countryside village. Moreover, they may feel as if they were stuck in tiny villages lost in the middle of nowhere, and try to get closer to the big cities. One of the solutions that could be set up to solve this problem, other than the traditional proposal of raising incomes, would be to sensitize the doctors to the desperate need of a medical presence in rural areas. By and large, very few physicians are aware of this need, let alone of the appalling situation which some of those areas are in. We could therefore act in this way, through media or lectures in medical schools for instance.

Dear Sir or Madam, Even though I appreciate new and innovative ideas for policies in our town, I would like to raise some concerns regarding the new proposal to ban mobile phones on public transport, in shops and restaurants. On the one hand I think most citizens can agree that it is untactful to have loud phone calls in the before-mentioned spaces, but on the other hand it is not advisable to ban something just because it is rude. It is not a crime to take up place for two on a bus with your legs spread wide, and neither should it be a crime to loudly argue on your phone there. If the culprit is a significant nuisance the bus driver could tell them to get off the bus even with the policies that are in place right now. For shops and restaurants such a proposition is ridiculous. These places are privately owned and thus the owners and staff should decide on their own what is allowed there and what isn't. I think anyone would be hard pressed to find any good reason why a regulation of mobile phone usage would be required here. Lastly, I have to mention that this proposal is defined so vaguely that even using one's phone quietly, for example listening to music with earbuds or checking one's e-mails would qualify as an offence. I do not think the public would be in favour of this. I very much hope you take these points into consideration. Yours faithfully, Herbert Herbertson

In most schools, studying music is optional or there may be no music classes at all. Nevertheless, maybe the students should, in regard to all the benefits they might withdraw from it, have to study music. I think music should be widely popularized in schools. By and large, people consider music as a pleasant hobby or as a nice concert to attend. At no time will most of them truly realise all the benefits they may get from music learning, mostly because nobody actually told them. Music can be seen as another way to communicate or express a wide pannel of feelings, generally in a softer way than we usually do, especially when it is about strong feelings and emotions such as pain, anger or passion. For instance, if you are taking issues with someone and that it makes you angry, then music may help you. Rather than having a falling out with this someone, you could play music - and through it, express all the emotions you are holding. Furthermore, learning an instrument, although it may be long and hard, enables people to improve the learning and pursuance skills of the future musician, with a view to reusing them later. Learning the violin, an instrument which playing isn't that easy, can be a real challenge but first and foremost a real opportunity to reach perfection. Moreover, music can be really helpful for introvert people who find difficult to interact with others, who prefer to stay back and may feel frustrated by it . It can concern antisocial, shy or less talkative people but also extrovert and expansive people who might find it difficult to keep their cool and remain calm despite sudden and strong feelings. To sum up, music is really to be popularized.

Television can educate at the same time that it entertains. Currently, television is facing a disruptive transformation in the way that people watch television programs. Television is further becoming an environment with more political and social influence on people. In the television schedule it is common to have programs talking about events that impact the mode of how society behaves currently. Due to changes in people's perceptions, television needs to approach delicate matters, such as environmental damage, homophobia, racism, violence against women, child prostitution, and other critical matters. To educate the public about these topics, television needs to be unbiased, principally about political issues. Television opinions have a profound impact on how people think about certain issues, so television needs to be unbiased so that it doesn't influence people's thoughts. Therefore, television remains an important way of communicating ideas, news, and opinions. If television wishes to remain as the main way of communication, it needs to change the way it acts.

Dear Sir and Madam, I am Fred Yamada, I have lived in the town for many years. I heard that the town council is studying banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. So I would like to let you know my opinion. I have objections to the banning. Firstly, please let me know the reason why you want to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think there are no reasonable reasons for banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think that it is reasonable to ban the use of mobile phones in concert halls. Secondly, please let us know the reason why you want to ban the use of the mobile phone in shops and restaurants. I think that shops and restaurants are not public spaces, but private areas. Is it possible to restrict the use of mobile phone in private areas by law? If owners want to ban the use mobile phones in their shops and restaurants, it may be possible for them to ask customers not to use mobile phones. Thirdly, if you implement banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, in an emergency how can you contact the people who are on public transport and in shops and restaurants? Nowadays, we feel that mobile phones make our life more convenient. So it is difficult to restrict the use of mobile phones by law. I sincerely ask you to consider the restriction. Best regards,

I think that always telling the truth is not so important, sometimes it is necessary to tell a lie. I think basically telling the truth is very important. I think that the one of the most important things in business is trust. To grow trust with stakeholders, including customers, I think it is very important to tell the truth. For example, if a vehicle manufacturer has some business trouble such as a recall of their vehicles, in general, such company should apologize to the customers and send a recall notice for all the customers who took the vehicles. Such a company will tell the truth of the reason for the recall. The reason why such a company would take the above actions is to keep their trust with stakeholders. So I think that it is important to tell the truth in our business. On the other hand, I think we have some situations that it is better to tell a lie. For example, a lot of children believe in Santa Claus at Christmas. A lot of children are looking forward to receiving presents from Santa Claus at Christmas. Although adults know that the parents give the Christmas present, most adults do not want to tell the truth so that they would not disclose the secret of Santa Claus. I think this kind of lie will not do any harm for anybody. So I think that it is necessary to tell a lie in some cases.

These seem to be 2 nice deals, of course, each one it has its own advantages and disadvantages, I will explore it clearly before giving my opinion. I will go through the first offer, the offer is to live until 100 years old, enough for a normal life. You will be calm, with not too many attentions from citizens, you would live in the countryside, near the sea. You will hear the waves coming from the infinite ocean every morning when the sun rises. Your life is just going around the town, it is a normal town without sounds, noises from visitors. Your life starts and ends without the notice of people around the world. You will have a limited relation with other people in other towns, in the case you go for a vacation. Now, with a life of more intensity, the maximum years you can live could be 65. Because it is intense, therefore it is 35 years less in the longevity. You probably would live in a city, with noises and you would party every weekend, like a university student. Now, I would like to give my opinion, I would choose the second offer. I don't want to live a life without caring people, without technology, without money. I can handle the problem that I can't live long, but 65 years is enough for me to spend time, happiness and memories with my relatives. I can take care of my family, but if I choose an intense life, I probably would have spare money to pay for them, from a house to activities. So in conclusion, 65 years but intense seems to be a better offer to me.

In my opinion, the better choice depends on the lifestyle of each student when they were brought up and studied at high school. Some of them enjoy an independent life, depend on themselves in their studies and their work, but others like to live with their families, they hope that their families will always support them to achieve their goals and encourage them to overcome difficulties in life. For me, their parents should help them achieve their goals. However, they also ought to offer as good an environment as they can for their kids to be mature and successful in their life. There are two reasons for me to agree with living on their own. The main reason is they can live independently so they must face problems and solve them on their own. The important thing is they must trust themselves. They will learn the way to deal with and overcome challenges naturally. When they live on their own, they will know and understand their parents' tough in life. From that, they would love their families more and try their best to live better. Besides, the independent life will help them contact and interact with many people. They will learn how to maintain and have a good relationship with friends, families and people around them. They will know how to share their love, be happy and lend a sympathetic ear to the poor. On the other hand, they can be keen on the things they like, the work they love and try many new things which they have not experienced yet. They ought to lead their life and make decisions about everything. They also have a chance to relax and conveniently to study and follow their educational life. It's really difficult to cope with homesickness in the early days when they separate from their families. But if they get over that, they will be more mature and learn a lot of things. In these early days, the parents should be their friends to be broad-minded and give them some useful advice, especially encourage them to have more courage to follow the way they have chosen. In conclusion, although being alone to be mature and feeling relaxed to achieve more in their educational life is significant to many teenagers, following family advice and instructions to deal with any problems is important for their mature life.

On first glance it might seem tempting to choose a short and intense life for oneself. 40 years, let's say, full of romance, excitement and adventure. Just skip the uncomfortable part of life when you get old and need to be cared for. But I think this option might sound much better than it would actually turn out to be. There seldom is a life full of romance without heartbreak, and there never has been a life without any peril. To live intensely not only means to be joyous all the time, it also means to feel deep sorrow and experience crushing stress. I do not think there is a way to only amplify the positive aspects of a life without having any tradeoff and therefore I would argue someone who lives and feels intensely also faces intense hardships in their life. A long and calm life, on the other hand, gives you the benefit of more time, and as we all know time is the most valuable resource there is. If you spend your time wisely there is no good reason why you would trade any of it away. A calm life doesn't need to be any less fulfilling than a short and adventurous one, as calm doesn't equal boring and living long in no way needs to get dull. There can never be enough time to spend with your family or to engage in a hobby so I would gladly take 100 years.

Health is the most important factor in human life. The assistance with diseases, in routine exams and an explanation about better ways to have better health are essential. But, although they are so important, some people don't have fair access to doctors. Doctors are more accessible in big cities. A lot of situations contribute to this: salary and conditions for good work are more common problems, but the solution comes from more complex actions that only solve these questions. The exercise of some professions involves correct conditions for work and the salary that the worker receives. And, unfortunately, this factor isn't good in every place. The capital and big cities, usually, have better conditions and this impacts so much in the choice for doctors, for example. Being a doctor is a profession that involves a lot of social status, how much money is earned and the correct structure for work. But, this work has a relationship with passion for lives and health too. Despite this, a lot of workers just choose this job because of money. In this situation it isn't easy to compete about salaries, because usually there is a better bid in the run. For better access for everyone to health and doctors, it's so important that give better conditions for doctors working in rural areas and country cities. But, it is important to make a structure for workers in health, like doctors, to have better results to access a better life outside the capital. In addition, orientation about the choice for students for work can help them understand that a doctor goes where the patient needs, loving the job.

I like to do exercise, five times a week. I don't have a specific time, but I prefer to do it in the morning. I do it at home these days because we have a pandemic, so the gym is closed. You have to be smart when you choose exercises because the choice is the important thing to keep it going. My daily exercise is squats, push ups, abdominals, and hand stretches, and these are my favorite.

Of course I prefer a short life but much more intense. It's insultous for me thinking of a life in which I don't have anything special to do, but only to live! In our life we have to make projects, to establish goals and to work in order to achieve that. We need to understand how important books are for our culture and our knowledge about many sciences and although many people don't appreciate reading we need to put in our mind that a book is a friend that can't speak but can teach us. Nevertheless, I consider that physical exercise is a very good way to improve our skills even if we are speaking about mind skills but the efforts related to it can improve in a very strong way the way that we undertake problems. I can't have respect for people who prefer to live with the help of other people and, sorry for my strong words, but these kinds of human beings are one the biggest disgraces in our world. I hate them with all my powers and I know that many of them can't respect our likes and they prefer to live with our taxes and our efforts. They're parasites and I respect them as human beings like me and others but they have to find an honest job immediately.

I think being healthy is more important than having a lot of money. I am not talking about only physical health, but also of mental health. However, to have money is essential to keep a healthy mind, due to the fact that to have money, principally through work and entrepreneurship, helps people to avoid stress and depression from lack of money. Logically, this works only if people are working in jobs that they like, if not, rather than helping people to keep a healthy mind, this will harm their mental health. It's no use having money if you are in poor health. It's no use working incessantly if you are getting stressed, frustrated, sick, and unhappy. It's important for you to have a balance between health and money. From the moment that you understand this equilibrium, you will get an idea of what the most important thing in your life is: to have health, a good job, and your family beside you.

At the moment, my main goal is to learn English to get a job with a good wage. From the moment that I have an intermediate level, my chances of getting a job are much higher.

As far as I'm concerned, I think students benefit more from having different teachers throughout the years than having one teacher. First of all, having the same teacher for several years makes that students get used to their teacher. It can be an advantage: the students know their teacher better, for instance. However, the students shouldn't get too familiar. Indeed, as the students are used to their teacher, they can get inattentive or irreverent more easily. Besides, it depends on how a teacher works with his students. If the lesson is cool, enjoyable, and still instructive, for instance, then maybe having this teacher for a few years can be great. Otherwise, if a teacher is boring and his lessons uninteresting, having new teachers each year enables the students to avoid the problem of having a boring teacher. Furthermore, the differences which exist from one teacher to another can help students to get familiarized with different ways of teaching and learn different skills. To conclude, it is a real benefit to have new teachers each year because of the differences existing between them.

Mankind has found solutions to most problems that make our lives hard, however these solutions sometimes bring some issues with them. An inactive lifestyle is one of the problems that modern lives bring our lives. A large number of university students are suffering from an inactive lifestyle, and their lives become more vulnerable constantly. I believe that every university student should do sport during university. First of all, doing sports improves students' learning skills. Most studies that have been done so far today on university students indicate that students who do sports have more developed brain cells than those who don't do any sports. Having strong cells is essential to learn more quickly and effectively. Furthermore, doing sports provides relief and it reduces stress. Less stress means more efficient learning. Secondly, doing sports gives students another important opportunity: team work. Students can learn to work with each other if they do sport. There are 2 students, one of whom is doing a team sport and the other isn't. According to most statistics, the former student tends to work with others more than the second student. Those who say that doing sport is only waste of time and it makes you only tired are wrong because doing sport has various kinds of opportunities. It is essential for students. It is not a waste of time. While students do sport, they learn and share. It does not also make you tired because when people do sport certain hormones make you more energetic and also happy. Therefore, doing sports has more beneficial features than we thought. To sum up, modern life is forcing us to an inactive lifestyle. doing sport is the most logical solution to solve inactivity. And it is also essential for university students. Thus, every university student should do sport. If they don't want to do it, then they should be encouraged to do sport.

There are different reasons why most medical doctors don't want to work in rural areas, I could just list a bunch of them right here, but I'll try to explain the ones I think as the main reasons for this phenomenon. In my opinion the poor remuneration can be seen as the main reason as all the process to become a doctor involves a lot of money and effort, so it's comprehensible that someone who passed through all these challenges expects a life with the benefits of money in a good place to live. Another important point neglected sometimes is that, like all of us, medical doctors are humans, they have the right to have this sense of belonging to a community, and to just expect they have to go to a remote place because that place needs a doctor is a naive thought. These people have families, friends, relatives, relationships that are entangled in the cities they live. These problems can be seen in different countries, poor or rich, but I believe there're some ways to help solve them. A short term solution could be more incentives so doctors would be attracted to work in these places. Another idea that comes to mind is a rotation among doctors so some of them would spend some time in these areas and return home after that. However the main and lasting solution would be an education system that gives everyone the same opportunities, so this rural areas could have medical doctors of their own, professionals attached to these communities receiving what a doctor deserves for the responsibility of caring for lives.

Nowadays, it is well known that learning to speak a foreign language is as important as it was in the past, and I absolutely agree with that for the following reasons. Firstly, learning to speak a foreign language could help you to find a great job abroad. As a result of that you might earn a vast amount of money and you will have the opportunity to live in another country, so it could be awesome. Furthermore, speaking a foreign language could provide you with a lot of money as you can work in different places. As a consequence of earning a huge amount of money, you are allowed to spend it on outstanding things, such as blissful travels, an astonishing house, and chill holidays. Last but not least, learning to speak a foreign language has other advantages, such as living better, getting to know impressive cultures, and meeting superb people. Therefore, it is highly profitable for you. In conclusion, I strongly consider that learning to speak a foreign language is as important as it was in the past, as it makes it easier for you to find work abroad, it allows you to gain a lot of money to spend on enjoyable things, and it brings you the opportunity to live better, get to know wonderful cultures, and meet stunning people.

I think students should not have to study music. It's correct if it is a student choice, wrong if it is an obligation from the school. I appreciate that in the world there are schools where studying to play a musical instrument is one subject at the height of their business, but I think learning to play a musical instrument isn't an important quality in a student, to find a job or to be a good citizen in society. In high school I learnt to play guitar but when I grew up I didn't play guitar anymore, because I wasn't good. In my opinion, it is wrong to force students play a musical instrument if they didn't want to play any musical instruments. Not everyone who studied at school to play an instrument will become a music star, furthermore to learn to play a musical instrument, families are forced to buy the instrument and maybe they can't afford these expenses. On the other hand, I agree with schools where students must study music, because music is an art and it is correct to teach students the power of music on people, but I want to say, "Stop learning to play a musical instrument, no one will become Ringo Star or John Lennon!!!"

Dear Mr. Stark, I am writing this letter to the council of our town, because I want to give my opinion about banning phones in some public places. In my honest opinion, banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants is not wise. At least, from my chair. As you know we are living in a free country, in a free city. You, as the government of our town, should not ban mobile phones. By doing this, you are taking part of our freedom in places such as public transport, shops and restaurants. Furthermore, I think that most citizens of our town would not be happy about this ban, neither would I. In those places people should be allowed to do whatever they want. Some people use to work remotely from restaurants. It may be their main source of income. No one enjoys losing their job, you or I would not either. It will be a big, hard hit for those people. There are more things why this decision is not correct and optimal for the town. One of them, is that a lot of people are learning or even surfing on the web when they are travelling by public transport. They can learn new languages, read books, message their friends, etc. Just think about all of those things. It is pointless to waste their time by not doing anything. Summarising all the things, which I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that you will change your future decisions. Your sincerely, XYZ.

In my opinion, for students it is better to have the same teacher for several years, especially for foreign languages. The reason is very simple, changing teachers each year also changes the study method, the teacher's pronunciation, and so on. Another reason is that, especially in primary school, the relationship between a teacher and child is the first step in a student's growth, and if the teacher changes every year, the children don't form a strong relationship with the teacher. If a child has the same teacher every year, he feels less in awe if he needs help. Now, the teacher situation is more complex than in the past, because schools haven't the equipment to start a school year with teachers for all subjects, and not all teachers have a regular job contract. Every year, 50% of the teachers don't teach in the school where they taught last year, maybe because they prefer to give lessons in a school closer to where they live.

My favourite season of the year is winter, due to it being the season of my birthday. I was born on Christmas Day, 1995. I love winter also because I can go to ski with Andrew, my boyfriend. Few people love winter like I do, it is unusual. In summer you can go to the beach and spend all day sunbathing, but for me completely happiness is to sit down around a table with a hot chocolate, sing Cristmas songs and wait for the opening of the presents behind the Cristmas tree. My friends totally disagree with my opinion, they love summer!

Nowadays, young people prefer having a short but intense life to a long and quiet life. I am a person who tries to live each day as if it were my last, a life full of risks is more exciting than a boring life. Personally speaking, a lot of old people have had long lives because they were hardly able to follow their dreams. During their childhood they grew up with the idea that a good life was getting married, having a job and having children. In fact, currently there are people who still have that idea of an ideal live, even if they would like to try different things. Some people prefer following a predetermined routine to follow their own aspirations. I grew up with people who told me that I should get a man beside me, I should have children before I 30 and I should serve my husband all my life. However, my idea of living is pretty different, I enjoy doing outdoor activities which make me feel adrenaline, activities such as climbing, parachuting, skating, etcetera. I am aware that some activities could be dangerous, but it is something that is worthwhile, travelling around the world is fascinating as well, visiting amazing places in remote areas and tasting exotic food are things that everyone should try once. In conclusion, each person has different ways to see life and has different aspirations. We should do whatever makes us happy and that is why I would choose a short but intense life.

The design of an office has a stronger relationship than the demand that the company has for its results. The indoor design for every place has, in principle, a need to achieve the best environment for those who are inside. For a correct design for this, it's important to think about the routine in the office, a customer service place, a customer service attend, a meeting room and ergonomic quality for workers. In a company that needs a lot of concentration and individual work in projects, the enclosed workstation or cubicles are more effective. They help employees to focus and thus to find the solutions and conclusions for individual demands more easily. In some companies, however, the task needs more teamwork, creativity, and freedom for discussion and reflection in a group. In this case, offices where open designs happen, following up ideas, communications, and a collaboration process is more effective. In addition, sometimes this place can have some space for interaction moments in a team, some that this place can put some space for interaction moment in a team, behind the project demands, like a room with a sofa and games or to promote a happy hour moment. The design for spaces where the people need to spend a lot of time needs a specific design to achieve good comfort and to contribute to the best result. So, the design for an office in a model where there aren't any walls or with workstations depends on the company's need for results from the employees. It's important to look to build a pleasant place and that it helps everybody to get the best result in their personal development.

Nowadays, it is well known that computers and tablets shouldn't replace books in schools and universities, but I firmly believe that they should replace them for the following reasons. Firstly, it is absolutely essential to say that computers and tablets provide students with more knowledge than books as tablets and computers have Internet access, so pupils could have access to various sources of information. As a result of that they can learn more things than by reading books. Furthermore, computers and tablets have videos where information is better explained than it is in books. As a consequence of that, children could learn new things in astonishing ways, thus they will have better marks. Last but not least, the information with which computers and tablets provide students is always updated, so pupils aren't going to study the same things all the time. Therefore, they will find studying a rewarding activity. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers and tablets should replace books in schools and universities as they supply more knowledge to students than books. They have stunning videos where the information is explained better to students and the information on computers and tablets is always updated thus students will find studying a pleasurable activity.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter in response to the ban on the use of mobile phones in public places which the town council is considering. As far as I considered, it must not be implemented but some rules or laws should be necessary. It is common knowledge that mobile devices are an essential component of people's lives in this modern world and they use them almost everywhere. It is indisputable that some of them use those devices with a lack of morality and they sometimes show disrespectful behaviour. One of major issues is noise, which is caused by people who talk on the phone loudly on the bus or train, and other passengers are bothered and frustrated. Although these kinds of drawbacks are paramount and should be addressed, I believe that using gadgets in public spaces has some advantages. For instance, people can do their work, check up on their children, read emails and study, which can make people's daily lives better and productive. For this reason, in my opinion, texting, reading and other functions that do not make any sounds should be allowed. In other situations, such as in a public library, shops and restaurants, this should also be considered. In conclusion, I object to the total ban of using mobile phones in public places. However, it would be acceptable to control the use of them with some restrictions in order to maintain public morals. Yours faithfully, A citizen

If we look around us, regardless in what part of the world we are, what we notice is that the majority of people possess a mobile phone in their hand. Mobile phones are extremely convenient and useful. Not only do they allow us to speak in real time to our families and friends but they also allow us to rapidly get any information we need on many different topics. Today we could even say that people are addicted to mobile phones. Nobody would agree to be separated from his mobile phone. In addition to that, people are inclined to excessively use their phones, which is now becoming very inconvenient and highly disturbing especially in public transport, and in shops and restaurants. Sometimes pedestrians cross the roads without paying attention to the traffic lights which might be dangerous for themselves and for the drivers. Obviously the use of mobile phones is rising safety and security issues, therefore banning the use of mobile would be somewhat unfair because it's a matter of freedom. Anyway, the authorities have to undertake actions to tackle some abusive uses of mobile phones, maybe by implementing some simple rules for the use of mobile phones in public transport.

The Doctors' residence Many doctors prefer to live in big cities where they can find more opportunities to make money, whereas rural areas suffer from a lack of doctors. This problem has many crucial consequences. However, there are a number of beneficial solutions to address this problem. First, the government should support these rural areas with sufficient medical supplies and build big hospitals. For example, they can build one hospital in every region. Secondly, the government should provide suitable accommodation for doctors in these areas. They can build a huge compound for doctors and their families, for instance. Third, the the government can develop transportation means to help ease traveling between the village and city for doctors. Fourth, because doctors are going to live there with their families, the government should pay close attention to other services, such as schools, restaurants, and shops. Moreover, the government can offer a high salary for doctors who voluntarily decide to work at rural areas' hospitals. These solutions can help limit the significant consequences cause by insufficient medical staff in the countryside.

As we all know nowadays it's not common for people to do sports activities. It's terrifying that not many people are living healthily. It's way more common to lead an inactive lifestyle. It's obviously unhealthy. Some people say that children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week during their university and school terms. I believe that this approach is correct. But, it's not perfect either. Do you want to know why? Let's begin! First of all, doing sports is healthy. I'm not talking about a sport career or something, which obviously less healthy (maybe even less healthy than not doing sports at all), but running few times a week or even every day is without any doubts beneficial for our body and mental health. It's also important for our well-being. I understand that not everyone is talented, muscular or has good genetics. You have to accept that doing sports activities in general is necessary and it brings many benefits to us. As long as you have the motivation to change your life you should do sports. Of course, there're some downsides of this idea too. I think that forcing everyone is just simply not good. There're people who are really talented and are taking sports activities seriously. We shouldn't force them to attend those classes. It's pointless. That's a huge waste of time. As we all know time is extremely valuable! We cannot buy it. Going further, at some age you realise that you won't live for ever. You discover that it's important to be healthy and do healthy things. It's not good to force students who are mature enough to understand it. They have a lot of stuff going on in their lives and I believe that they don't need anyone to tell them that. Ending our essay, I just want to summarise all the things I have mentioned above. I believe that this idea is great and necessary. It's very important to do sports activities, but we shouldn't force everyone to do them.

My favorite season of the year is winter. In the city where I live, winter begins in November and it ends in May. I like winter because I feel more productive and relaxed day after day. Because of the cold weather, going to work or university is more pleasant for me due to the fact that I don't sweat on the way, or when I am working or studying. I can sleep better in the winter, and it is very important for me to keep productive throughout the day. The downside of winter in my city and state is that it causes flooding in many areas, pushing people affected to move to other areas, leaving their houses, which are flooded. The winter is very special for me. It is the season in which I feel happier and more tranquil, obtaining positive results at work and in my studies, despite the downside mentioned above.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing with regard to the possibility that the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops, and restaurants will be banned by the town council. As a citizen of this town I would like to give my opinion on this matter and give my arguments against these regulations. First of all, banning the use of mobile phones on public transport is not such a good idea. Some people do not have enough time to talk with others during the day, so when they commute it is their only chance to use the mobile phone to chat with friends or family. What is more, our town is a really popular place for tourists. I am afraid that taking this action will have a negative impact on our town's economy. As I have been talking with other citizens, they all agree that banning the use of mobile phones in shops is a very bad idea. Some people are very indecisive and they need help to choose the right products. Usually, there are not enough staff in the shop so, as a result, they phone their relatives or friends. Banning the use of phones in shops will also badly affect the economy. Finally, I do not support the idea of banning the use of mobile phones in restaurants, as recently there has been an increased interest in food blogging. More and more people film their food in order to earn money. Our town is famous for its restaurants that are friendly for bloggers, YouTubers, and other influencers. I strongly believe that banning the use of mobile phones is not a good idea. Overall, it will not only badly affect our economy, but it will also have a negative impact on the citizens' happiness. Yours faithfully, XYZ

Nowadays, more and more medical doctors desire to work in some cities for a handsome salary instead of working in the countryside. That leads to a medical employee deficiency in many rural areas which is a significant issue needing interferencing by the government. To solve the problem radically, we need to know about its reasons. From my perspective, many doctors incline to give priority to big cities as their workplace by virtue of the financial benefits that rural areas can't provide them with. It is undeniable that doctors in the urban areas could be paid as three times as much those in the rural places. It means that they have handsome incomes to pay their cost of living and meet their entertainment needs as well. Moreover, working in these cities brings them many opportunities to develop their careers. Many experts, prestigious hospitals and medical research centres all gather in the big cities all over the world, so it facilitates the medical doctors to develop themselves and take advantage of these beneficial conditions. Another reason is that there are not many up-to-date devices in the medical facilities in the countryside. However talented the doctors are, it is hard for them to cure their patients in these poor conditions. So, what are the solutions to that issue? I think there is always a need for government interference. They should bring in new laws that encourage the medical doctors to work in the rural areas. Maybe better compensation and a benefits package will work in those cases. It secures them more stable lives and makes them loyal to their work. Moreover, the government should provide the cutting-edge machines for the medical facilities in the countryside. It will be a shot in the arm that helps the doctors with their work. Besides, the clever advertisement campaigns to stimulate the sense of responsibility and love for medical work will be effective in attracting labour in the rural areas. With the above solutions, I believe that the issue will be dealt with radically. Keeping medical labour source balanced in both rural and urban areas is a really important thing in developing the whole country.

Nowadays, it is well known that some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, whereas other parents believe that it has a positive effects on children, but away from these issues I highly believe that they can have a positive impact on children for the following reasons. Firstly, it is absolutely essential to say that thanks to video games children develop their logical skills, as video games test children to sort out arduous dungeons. As a result of that, they can improve their logical abilities a lot.,. meeting new people is another benefit of video games as thanks to them children can enlarge their social ties. As well as that, they can meet stunning friends to play with and spend an awesome time. Last but not least, an improvement in creativity is another benefit of playing video games as they have a creativity mode in which players are allowed to create everything they want. As a consequence of that, children could have outstanding artistic skills in school. In conclusion, video games have a positive impact on children seeing that they can improve their logical abilities, they can also meet astonishing friends, and improve their creativity.

Nowadays, it is well known that zoos are great places for people to learn about animals, but I absolutely believe that animals belong in nature and it is awful to keep them in zoos for these reasons. Firstly, it is highly essential to say that animals live more comfortably in nature than in zoos as they can have a lot of space for moving and living wild. As a result of that, they can hunt their prey freely. Furthermore, in nature animals can build their own habitat for living without taking care of the crowded space that they have in zoos. As a consequence of that, they can live independently and more blissfully than in zoos, where they are kept an eye. Last but not least, the survival of animals in nature should be mentioned as in these places animals survive more than in zoos as they have a better life conditions than in zoos, where they are locked up and anxious. In conclusion, I strongly believe that animals should live in nature as there they could live more comfortably. They don't have a crowded space to move around in and they can survive longer than if they live in a zoo where they feel too isolated.

My Favourite Season Of The Year What is your favorite season? Right, I can answer this question for you saying that summer is a special season for me as it is very hot. As a result of that, I can eat a lot of freezing ice cream. Have your ever tried this amuseful ice cream? It is really delicious! Furthermore, another reason I deeply love summer is that when I was younger I used to be in the street all day playing with my astonishing friends and seeing mesmerizing sunsets with them. Those awesome memories! However, now summer is still my favorite season as when it is summer I can do more things that I don't usually do, such as painting stunning pictures, recording stunning videos for YouTube, and learning a foreign language. Also, I can hang out with my friends to go to the beach where I can spend a superb time with them. It is really blissful! And you, what is your favourite season?

Undoubtedly, being sedentary is extremely harmful and unhealthy for human beings. As a result, some people claim that pupils who are normally and physically inactive should be required to do sports activities three times a week to improve their health. As far as I am concerned, I partly agree with this idea as there are proven advantages of exercise. On the other hand, doing sports activities should be regarded as personal will and it should not be obligatory. All my points why we should or should not support this obligation will be addressed below. Not only can exercise reduce the possibility of having a critical illness but also help with concentration and mental issues. It has been reported that after exercising, our bodies will reduce insulin resistance and reduce inflammation, and it results in a decrease in diabetes or the possibility of other diseases. Additionally, our brain will release chemicals, such as endorphins, which help relieve pain and stress. The positive effects of regular exercise can be far better than we anticipate; because of that, we should suggest young learners do physical activities as frequently as they can. It has been convinced that adequate sports activities can bring countless merits from physical and mental perspectives by some scientists. On the other hand, we should still respect those learnersu2019 willingness to do physical activities, we should still respect those learners < u2019 > willingness to do physical activities, as if we are concerned about adolescents with physical challenges who may not be able to act like normal students. This decision could be not reasonable and will turn into a torture for those teenagers with disabilities unless those students are exempted from this rule. To sum up, in my view, compulsory sports activities three times a week are not essential for all young students, in spite of some gained benefits from doing them. In contrast to making regulations, we should encourage most students to do exercise spontaneously and educate them about the importance of sport instead.

In some schools, students must study music and learn how to play a musical instrument. In my personal opinion, it is a terrific idea, in other schools it may not be required, which I think is not good for the students. Schools in developed countries teach music to students as part of the subjects. It is important to learn how to play a musical instrument because it improves our discipline. In countries where education is priority and have the best students, they must study music and play at least one instrument. I studied music when I was in high school and I can play the guitar. but not everyone has the same opportunity. In my country schools usually don't teach music. In my personal experience learning how to play an instrument was very helpful to my personal enhancement. Music is part of the culture of the country and it is part of the history of the citizens. I hope that in the future our congress may use their power to make laws that insentive schools to organize music classes.

Everyone is different. Everyone prefers different things. Everyone is crazy about different things. Everyone simply differs. There are people who would prefer to live a long, calm life until 100 years old. But, there are also those who would prefer a shorter life, but much more intense. When it comes to me, I would definitely choose the first option. To be honest with you, I'm not really a social person at all. I do not like talking to people too much, hanging out with them, or even texting with them. I am, what is called today, an introvert type of a person. I would 100 percent agree with them. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against people who prefer to be partying and chilling with friends all the time. For me it's just a better option. Let me explain why! First of all, I would not enjoy dying in my early age. I think that nobody would. You see, having a long life is pretty nice. When you are partying or doing those type of things, it's really easy to fall into a bad group, which will hustly ruin you. If you are not aware of it, you will probably start taking drugs as a teenager. Maybe it will be more intense, but I don't think that dying before your 30s is an enjoyable thing. Going further, when you live a long, calm life it is more likely that you will get more from it overall. It is way easier to travel, experience things, enjoy life and simply live, when you are not stuck to a bad 24/7. It's the most important thing in your life. Summarising, I think that living a long and a calm life is a better and safer option for all people.

Travel in the future will be more comfortable, faster, and safer. With technological advances, people will have many ways to travel, including virtual travel to another place through simulation of the desired place. One of the factors that will impact the way how people will travel is Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence will help travel companies to better understand their travelers, and this will be used as a first attendance to customers. Among the things I believe will not change are planes, trains, buses, and ships as the means of transport most used to travel. I don't see other means of transport being used more than these in the future. I need to separate space travel. In recent years, we have seen a growth of interest in that type of travel. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin plan to transport people to other planets. This will have an amazing and thunderous impact on the world.

I agree with people that believe animals belong in nature and they don't deserve to be trapped in zoos. I know it's important that people visit animals in zoos in order to get to know them better and know how they behave. But, animals are born to be free creatures, spending their whole life in their natural habitat. From the moment that you remove animals from their natural habitat and take them to zoos, the animals end up losing their wild behavior and it is dangerous because when the animals go back to their natural habitat, they don't know anymore how to act in that environment. It is necessary to highlight an exception. Many species of animals are running the risk of extinction, and the zoos, in this case, are important environments to preserve these species. Therefore, the animals are being kept in zoos because they are in danger of extinction and they need care for reproduction. So I believe zoos must be kept for this purpose.

Music classes tend to be eliminated in schools gradually because more and more teachers and heads prefer their students to learn academic than art. They think they're right with their ridiculous reason that learning music cannot make their student pass into a good university. That's a lie. Honestly, we should add music classes into every grade in school because of the wonderful advantages of music for people who have a connection with it. Playing instruments, singing, and even just listening to music are good ways to relax after all depressions that students get in school's academic classes. And we cannot imagine completely the power of music in connecting people together. A shy boy may not feel confident in a crowd or normal conversations, but he will be a different one with music. No criticisms, no ego, just music. There is so much reliable research that shows that music is good for improving our brains and mental health. According to scientists, playing instruments is an amazing way to develop brain functions. In other words, we will be more intelligent, clever, and reduce Alzheimer disease's risks when we get older if we can play at least an instrument or even just learn how to play it. We don't need to discuss or demonstrate the benefits of music for mental health because it's totally clear. Every single person from the young to the old feels the same way when they listen to any kind of music. Rhythm can touch all the corners of our souls. Music is a significant treatment for patients used by psychologists. How can we ignore its benefits for students just because some people think it's not necessary? Schools should balance academic classes and art classes in student's timetables to get the best effect in teaching and learning.

Nowadays it is well known that some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university, and I absolutely believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. Firstly, it is highly vital to mention a disadvantage of studying abroad as sometimes it could be too heavy for students as they have to study in a foreign language. As a result of that, they wouldn't find this experience awesome at all. However, studying abroad has great advantages too, such as meeting stunning friends, learning abut new cultures, and improving your foreign language. As well as that, students will have an outstanding experience travelling abroad. Besides, it could also be an enriching experience as they will know different people who help them improve their language skills. To summarize, I highly believe that studying abroad is a superb idea for all students as the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

Young People and sports. Doing exercise is really important for our health. In addition there are lots of sports such as walking , swimming and dancing. In this essay I am going to give my point of view about doing sports for university students and school children. In my opinion, I believe that doing exercise is necessary to have a better lifestyle, which is great. I know sometimes it is very difficult for students to manage their time because they have lots of assignments to do and complete their them quizes on time to get a high scores but if you want the best lifestyle you need to think about yourself to live the amazing life that you want. Firstly , you need to organise your time by using apps or notebook etc. Secondly, prepare all the things that help you to be organised like your stationary, notebook, file, pen and pencil etc. Thirdly, prepare your sports clothes to do exercise, like going walking in the garden to walk for 20 minutes. After that, go home to have a shower. I feel you will feel relaxed. After that study hard for all your exams and be patient. Try when you have a busy day as a student to have leisure time to relax like having a beautiful cup with tea with wonderful classical music and switch off the light in that time you take a break so you do not stress so much and you enjoy your time. I will sum up with some fantastic advice to love yourself and take care to be positive, work hard, having ambition to become the best version for yourself. Do not forget you have a bright future. Just care in your life. Take care of your family.

Exercise is something necessary for our bodies. It helps us to focus and be healthy. In this essay I am going to write about the importance of exercise for children and teachers at school. Exercise is the best way to improve your physical health, your memory and your memory and your psychology. The reason why is that we need children to do some workout in the schools even if they are forced because nowadays there is a lot of obesity in children. For example, sitting at the computer for more than two hours a day harms their body. They can't walk and they will have problems with illness like obesity , eye problems and psychological problems like depression etc. On the other hand, not doing exercise will get them a lot of illnesses, like they will have low energy. As a result of that they will have low spirits. Another thing that children might have is isolation so without they will not be able to make relationships, such as with their classmate and their teachers. As an adult it is important to do exercise every day for at least ten minutes because the more you don't do exercise, the worse health you might get, especially when thirteen years old. Believe me, if you don't do exercise you will have a large bag of medicine that you will need to carry with you every day. In regards to doing according to my own research, I found out that people who do exercise every day become stronger, happier and they live long years because they look after themselves and listen to their bodies. To sum up, I will end up with this saying, a healthy body in a healthy mind. Always take care of yourself.

As a student who has studied for 12 years including living at home with my family for 9 years and living on my own for 3 years, I think that living independently is hard but the better choice. When we move away and live by ourselves, there are various problems that will appear such as money, time management, balancing learning and working and security. Money is the first and biggest issue when we live without family. We have to pay for everything, even something we didn't think about when we were living at home, like toiletries, ingredients, cleaners, etc.. In fact, some little things needed in a house for a normal life cost a lot in total. And when you have more things you have to do than just studying and working since you still lived with your family like going for groceries, cooking, cleaning, etc., it takes so much time for you and one important thing is that you have to learn how to manage your time and balance your studying at school and working for your living. Living independently is really hard and challenging, but if you can do it well, you will realise that you are more mature, independent, confident and responsible than an old version of you when you lived with your parents. You know how to order your life, and be a reliable and decisive person. No one can live with us forever, even our parents. Instead of trying to live with family as long as possible, live on your own to develop yourself and make your parents believe in you.

Dear principal, I would like to give my opinion about your idea. I was thinking that the requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work is not a correct thing, because volunteer work is an important thing and needs a lot of responsibility. People need to do it because they want to help someone, not because they have to do that. I already did volunteer work in some hospitals and asylums, and it is a serious thing, there are a lot of rules and we need to be kind and empathetic. I chose to do that, no one forced me. So it was a very good experience, but I would like to do, I think that volunteer work could be encouraged, like showing a video like the movie Patch Adams, which is a very beautiful story and my inspiration. People need to help to make a difference not only for graduation. Those people that only do things to receive an award could be rude and a bad idea for someone that needs help. I hope you understand my opinion about this subject. Best regards, Ju

Whether students decide to leave and live by themselves or stay at their parents' house, both have positive and negative aspects. For example, students who move out could face difficulties such as working and paying the rent while they are still attending courses and preparing exams. This type of life can surely make them grow and be more responsible but it can also overstress them and put too much on their shoulders, which a 20-year-old person could not be ready to manage. Otherwise staying at their parents' house could be easy in terms of organisation or money management, but even in this case there could be some problems such as the stress generated by the college life and dealing with your parents every day. The important thing is that young students take responsibility for their actions and choose wisely the road they decide to follow.

This last year showed everyone how crucial being active is. Studies show that a majority of people gained weight during the pandemic and what is more their condition also decreased. For some sport was difficult before the pandemic, therefore, is it necessary to force everyone to do sport 3 times per week? What if schools came up with the solution, which will suit everyone abilities? In my opinion this enforcement might be good, if children could individually choose what they want to do. It is well known that these days people, especially students, don't have enough time for extra activities. School work is consuming almost every minute of their lives, which should concern the government. PE is one of the most disliked subjects among teens; they experience trauma from bullying, some are forced to do activities above their abilities, and the key thing is - everyone is different but the system grades them the same. Authorities probably want good by forcing them to exercise, however they should focus on minimising study hours or how to adjust them to everyone. On the other hand, those 3 PEs per week might be the only form of activity they get during a week. Nowadays we can assume that this is true, yet shaming pupils for that creates a possibility that in the future they will develop disgust to any kind of physical movement. That is why, as a society we should show a more appealing side of sport so that we don't have to force them to participate in those lessons. All in all this statement has two sides - good one and a bad one. Ideally students will be in shape, including those for whom sport at school is the only form of activity. Nevertheless, individuals who aren't keen on doing sport might become traumatised and never 'touch' it again.

I usually sleep in a quiet room with some light. The light is from a pole near my house, at first it bothered me, but today it doesn't bother me anymore. To get quality sleep, you need at least 8 hours of sleep. I'll be able to sleep 8 hours only if my room is quiet and dimly lit. Sometimes the noise of cars and buses passing in the street wakes me up early in the morning. I didn't like it, but over time I got used to it too.

We live in a world that supposedly revolves around self-care. The widespreading tendency these days though, is lack of physical work. How often do we run into a person, especially a young one, who exercises regularly? Sadly, to majority of adolescence minds, there are other, more meaningful priorities in life than health. Quite a thought - provoking solution with a view to terminating this baffling speculation is to make all students and children exercise. Firstly, it is generally held that a lack of physical exercising equals struggling with health. Furthermore, I believe that modern technology is a nail in teenagers' coffin. The fact that perfectly illustrates it is their frequent preferences of spending their leisure time on Instagram rather than cycling or jogging. Isn't that frustrating? What's more, from a psychological standpoint, an order of exercising at least 3 times per week can be motivating for youngsters. What I mean is, as soon as they set their aim, they allow themselves to gain self - confidence which is maintained as utterly useful at their age. Referring to my previous arguments, another convincing fact is that teenagers and students can be sometimes overly careful with their future lives. Keeping in mind that sport facilitates them to maintain a healthy lifestyles, exercising will benefit them well perhaps in 10 years' time. On the other hand, however, forcing kids to exercise can cause dreadful anxiety because of the pressure they'd be put under. Vitally, in my view, a more effective way would include conversations with young people, lessons and articles encouraging them to take up some sport. Taking everything into consideration, I come to the conclusion that awareness about the benefits of exercising should be spread among children and students. This way, it is highly likely that they will naturally decide to become athletic all by themselves. By and large, surely, exercising at least 3 times a week is recommended for them!

It is true that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. With good health, we can do anything we want in our life. We know that money is also an important thing in life. With money we can buy food, a house, and lots of things for our standard of living. However, I think that having good health is better than having money. First, physical health has got a big effect on our work, so improving physical health every day can help you have good strength to do lots of work every day. For example, physical health is quite important for students, who have to do a huge amount of homework every day. Second, we have to keep our mental health always in a good state, so we always have motivation for work, family, our family, and friends. Without good mental health, the emotions of everybody will be upside down, so then we can lose our mind. This may cause lots of big problems. Because of bad mental health, rifts occur in the relationship between people. Finally, if you have good health, you must protect it. When you have got a disease, you'll know money can't bring your health back. In short, money and health have the same importance in our life. However, we should know how to balance money and health.

I have known Write and Improve for about 3 years. Back then, in the four skills, writing was my worst skill but I didn't know how to improve that. Fortunately, I found this website from my brother's suggestion. And that was the first time I tried it out. I have been using Write and Improve since I was 8. During the time I used it, I saw that it has lots of functions that the others don't have. First of all, it classifies into 5 small groups, that are: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Business and Just for fun. You know the purpose you need it for. You are the only one who could know what your level is. So, it will give you the exams that are related to your level. After you know what your level is, you'll go into that page. There are lots of topics and problems that people have been solving. Therefore, that makes your brain need to work really hard. When you finish your test, click "Check" so it'll mark it and you'll know what level are you at, C1, B2, C2, etc. It will indicate to you where you got it wrong and also how to fix that. Therefore, these are the things you'll get when you use Write and Improve. To me, it doesn't have any mistakes, it's perfect and I saw my writing skills were going up. One piece of advice that I want you to know, while you do the exams, please try to use your own words, don't research it so you'll know exactly what your mistakes are. I hope you enjoy yourself while using this website.

Most medical doctors want to work in the cities so their salary is more than working in the countryside. This means in the rural areas there aren't enough doctors. So what are the reasons for this problem here and how to improve it? In my opinion, they want to work in the cities because the salary that is paid in the countryside is lower than in the cities, therefore they all want to work in the metropolis. I know that everyone loves money but each person uses money for different purposes. So do the medical doctors. Because of this there aren't enough physicians in the rural areas. There are some civilians who live in the mountainous areas. If they have some problem, they could not get to the hospital in time. Therefore, they have to die. To me, the best way to solve this problem is all doctors should get the same salary, whether in the cities or the countryside. When a medical student becomes a doctor, he or she has an opinion, which is, "I have to work in the big hospital." So, I hope that our government spends more money on building more hospitals in remote areas, paying the physicians the same as the doctors in the cities, mobilizing young medical doctors to work there and telling them that in the rural areas we need doctors more than ever.

In general I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room because I sleep lightly. But when I'm very tired, I can sleep anywhere. Sleep is often a question of mindset. If, during the day, you have been stressed by your work or any situations, it will be difficult to sleep easily. In a normal situation, the better way is to meditate just before going to sleep and take a "tilleule" herbal tea. You can sleep quietly with or without light and noise!

There are two chief types of office design nowadays: separating employee's workstations into different cubicles and putting no divider between them. From my perspective, I would prefer the first one rather than the latter due to its prominent advantages. First of all, an enclosed workstation tends to enhance the focus abilities of white-collar workers. They could not be distracted by externalities such as a coworker's action when there is a divider between them from other employees. As a result, their work quality will increase and improve a lot. Moreover, the workers can be ensured of their privacy in the office. The walls separating employees from their co-workers play the role as the wardens for their own houses. There, they can freely do anything that comforts them without being afraid of anyone else. A real life example, a man who is forgetful can stick some sticky notes on the one side of wall whether his colleague likes them or not. That also helps them avoid some embarrassing situations. So, workers can work in a good mood which has a positive effect on their work performances. Another reason is that the walls make the office look more tidy and aesthetic. They keep employee's workstations in the right order and lessen the risk of taking the wrong things of other people. Bottom line, the enclosed workstations facilitate employee comprehension. Making them more concentrated on their work, ensuring their privacy, keeping the workplace formal is the thing that makes this type superior to others.

I guess what I'm writing is something that the bulk of students do not agree with, but my favourite season is autumn. I really like it for many reasons and the most important one is that I like the atmosphere with a touch of sadness and the grey sky, and I love it when weather is not hot and there's no more dryness around. I like the weather turning fresher and wet. For me autumn is a metaphor of life, with the days becoming progressively shorter and nature losing its colours. I think people are a little weak and they undergo the darkness of autumn, but this is a wrong attitude, and all of us should begin to love the less bright seasons. Also, I 'm happy to go back to school where I have a steady relationship and school gives me a steady growth. I remember at the beginning I went astray because of the fog, but in the end I had no more fear of going to school by myself. Autumn helped me to develop my braveness, and now I can roam around for the entire day.

I would prefer to have new teachers each year. First, I think it is good to encounter a new thing every year. But, maybe it is good if you have some teacher that you are close with and you can talk to them every year. That teacher is not always the teacher that you study with it maybe come from club that you it and maybe the teacher that you meet by coincidence can give you classes more comfortably than the teachers that you study with. And the important thing is teachers aren't always good and it is maybe better if you can change and bet that new teacher is better than your previous one. Another reason that I think is really important is we can prevent the teacher using his charisma to influence students. This situation can be a great disaster for both students and teachers. Although this is not a good way to prevent this, but who know it not good enough.

It is a true that a book is an important thing when you study. It brings you knowledge about the world. Also, with the development of technology, e-books were invented and became as popular as books. With e-books, student can study everywhere with their computers or tablets. However, e-books shouldn't replace books in schools and universities. First, to use an e-book we need an Internet connection, so this may a bad thing for students, as they can't study without it. For example, when students go somewhere where there is no Internet connection, but they have to search for information, they can't find anything. Second, everyone knows that using computers or tablets too much can harm your eyes, so when you use an e-book it can harm your eyes. Finally, using computers or tablets can distract you because you may use another app and not really concentrate on studying. In conclusion, e-books have brought lots of benefits to us, but they shouldn't replace books.

Nowadays, it is well known that high schools and universities are implementing more and more requirements in order to graduate, and despite most students' disagreement, I rather see those as great opportunities to challenge them and help them improve and gain a wide variety of skills. Firstly, it is undeniable that students' schedules are usually really occupied, so volunteering could be a quite wished experience for them although they might not get round to doing it. As a result, making that activity mandatory may be something positive and enjoyable for them while it is academically necessary. Secondly, the fact that volunteer work fosters better people and bounty is also an important point to consider because they will be feeling great doing some charity work or giving their help, which at the same time will help their mental health and calmness as many studies have shown. Last but not least, the job experience they will be acquiring throughout that time should be mentioned since it will be something so useful and remarkable that they will not forget about it. For instance, the communication skills, the social interactions, team work abilities... In conclusion, from my point of view, requiring students to complete volunteer work in order to graduate is a great way to help them to become more professional, better people and gain regarded skills.

I think playing video games can have both a positive and negative impact. It depends on how children use them. It is not wrong if children play video games, many people in my country play video games to learn a language and it definitely works. You can play video games and learn a language at the same time. Now, we can consider playing video games a sport since we have an r - sport and it is getting bigger and bigger. If you consider it practice until you are a good player you can do it it term of sport. But many people can't make it to that position and not all video game that they consider like sport then I think it is also important that you have to arrange what time you play and what time you don't.

Essentially what you are asking is if one would choose a short life of intimacy, home and family versus a fast paced life of sensation, never forming long lasting intimate relationships and flittering from one thing to the next in search of adventure and excitement. The choice is crystal clear. A slow, short, boring life but one filled with the real intimacy of a true partner; the love and nurturing of a family, pets and causes and development of real and loyal friendships beats the fast life of loneliness, ships that pass in the night, quick trust and quicker betrayals; the excitement of adventure, shared alone or with strangers, the duplicity and fickleness of the limelight. The answer is clear, just as George Bailey learned in "It's a Wonderful Life." You can never put a price on real love, trustful intimacy or the knowledge that there are friends who will be there when you call. It's boring sometimes, and the duty is often tedious but when you go to bed at night you are not alone, in your soul. The other way leads to alcoholism and extreme experience, drug abuse, divorces, loneliness and suicide. Just look at the lives of the stars and famous, all seeking that trust and intimacy and finding only betrayal and loneliness. No wonder they turn to hard drugs - they are committing slow suicide, passing the time oblivious to their aloneness while they are nodding off, waiting to die, wishing for someone to love them, truly love them, for who they are, not what they represent or can do to advance the careers of other ambitious wannabees. Everyone is different but you may someday agree that a normal life is equal to or more fulfilling than an intense life. I have been fortunate to spend years traveling and enjoying new experiences but take the greatest pride in professional and family life. I will gladly take even just 50 years of waking up most mornings without a hangover and instead spending time with family.

As to all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week, I personally agree with this idea. I think that one of the merits of doing sports is to make people healthy. And I also think that it is no problem that you choose what kind of sports you want to do. For example, you can choose walking, jogging, swimming and do such sports at least 3 times per week, it will make you healthy. From my experience, when I was a high school student, I belonged to the judo club in our high school. At that time I practiced 5 times per week, from Monday to Friday, sometimes we had a test match with other high school students on Saturday and Sunday. Through this experience, I could improve my judo skills and train my body. At the same time I could understand how it is important to continue to train myself every day both in sports and in study. So I think that it is important for young people to do sports at least 3 times per week. l think that one of the merits of doing sports is to be able to make friends by doing sports. Some sports are team sports, such as football, baseball, etc. And some sports are individual sports, such as swimming, jogging, etc. By doing even individual sports, I think we can make friends who like the individual sports. From my point of view, when I was a university student, I joined a ski club in our university. In the ski club, some were very good at skiing, some were just novices in skiing. Furthermore, there were some foreigners in the ski club. So I could make a lot of friends in the club so I could communicate with many members who had different cultural backgrounds, so I could understand how important diversity is.

I agree with the second opinion. I think it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. All animals belong in nature and no one has a right to keep them in zoos. I think zoos have many problems. First, I think no one wants to live in a cage or a small room. If you can't imagine that, then try to imagine that you are in prison and you have done nothing wrong. I think it is not fair to put any animal in a place they don't want to be and don't belong in. There are many ways that you can learn about animal such as by going and finding them in nature. I think if you have seen animals living in nature once, you will never want to go to zoos again. Second, many zoos have a problem with hygiene. It is bad to let animals live in a terrible place. If you think it is right to keep animal in zoos to study them, I think it is best if you study them in real nature.

Let's start with the advantages first. I think the greatest advantages are that studying in another country can give you an experience that you can't find in your country, and you can go to a country that can offer the best solution for your studies. It can make you understand another culture, other politics, and another way of living. I think it can make you understand more what another culture thinks. It gives you the vision that you can't find in your own country. Sometimes it gives you an experience that you never thought you would receive. But, you need to open your mind because if you don't you can't understand what other people think. And the disadvantage is sometimes people can't live in a culture they are not familiar with and it can make them feel bad about themselves. The most important thing is it can fool you with the good things that you can't have in your country and it makes you look down on the people in your country. It makes you think you're better than the rest of the people in your country.

Thanks to the extension of communication networks and the promotion of the Internet over the last two decades, a new way of learning has appeared. Online learning is a system that is much more flexible and adaptable to different ways of living. Thanks to the increase in resources and materials available, studying online is now a viable option for most people, as it adapts to people's different schedules and lives. Now it is easier to find information about your chosen topics, you have less rigid schedules, and you are able to find a course which fits your needs. On the other hand, an individual's demands should be higher. Now, it is up to each person to find the motivation and to follow up, trying to find areas without distraction and to take advantage of the available moments. So, as I recently discovered, there is a new website to improve your writing, which is called Write & Improve where you can write and rewrite your own compositions at various levels (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) forcing you to improve your grammar and write about some subjects and topics. Although this way of learning sometimes is not easy to follow up on and continue to work with because you have to do homework yourself, if you plan well and motivate yourself, you can improve day by day. The Write & Improve method is helping me to adapt and incorporate new grammar into my English level.

Books and Technology Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? That question has been asked for so long and so far nobody has a concrete answer to give. My personal opinion is no, computers and tablets should be complementary to each other. I believe people need to handle books and flip through the pages. I think it is part of the learning process. When people hold a book, they can feel closer to the book than when they just touch a cold, black screen. Although some researchers have said that tablets and computers should replace books at school, I disagree with them. But I know children need to face new technologies to be accustomed to them because, certainly, they'll use them at some stage of their lives. Otherwise, using a computer or tablet can maybe be good for the environment. Think about how many sheets of paper you will avoid printing if you use any sort of technology to read something, mostly not important things. In short, I'd say there are lots of pros and cons for this idea.

My best holiday was when I went to a museum by myself last year. It is the museum I had really wanted to go to for a long time. The night before that day I was really excited about the next day's trip. It almost made me stay in bed all night. I think that night I slept just 5 hours. In the morning, I woke up earlier than usual and left the house earlier than usual too because I needed all of my time to stay as long as I could. I went and visited every room and every exhibition that I could. The one that impressed me the most was the show where an artist had come to show his skill in painting. I always want to paint some enormous work that can live forever. Also, the artist that had come was my favorite artist. That is why I chose to go to this specific day. I think I can't forget that day in my whole life.

When I was a child, my relatives used to ask me what I wanted to be when I was older. My answer hasn't been what they wanted to listen to. As I said "biologist" or "volleyball player," my cousins answered "a medical doctor." It is obvious which ones had the more attention later. I think this episode might help us to understand the first question. A lot of medical doctors don't do what they do because they love this. The truth is: they love the money that working as a medical doctor can offer them. From this logic, although we have found the key to the problem other questions are formed, such as, "How can we solve it?." Sometimes, I think what kind of society we would have, if every career earned the same salary. Would we have a lot of people wishing to become medical doctors? I'm sure we wouldn't. On the other hand, inside this same logic, I'm also sure that all medical doctors who have still chosen this career would be the ones who would work everywhere, because they love what they do. Although this problem seems easy to solve, it's not. To change the society's thought so that we could finally have a fairer world where we might work doing what we like, would make us change our way of life (which means our perception about money and happiness). The medical doctor's problem is just a piece of the whole problem in modern society.

The School of the Future The school system is significantly rigid in comparison with the development of our world. We can think, for example, about means of transportation. They developed from bare feet to shoes, horses, trains, automobiles, and the automobiles developed from steam cars to today's hybrid cars. And what has changed in schools so far? When I was studying, it looked like this: I was sitting with my class in a classroom and in front of me was our teacher standing beside a blackboard from where he was lecturing us. To my knowledge, it is not much different from the memories of my parents and I think that it isn't different from the memories of their grandparents. They had been sitting in a classroom and in front of them had been their teacher, lecturing. Of course, there are some differences. Teachers can use projectors and televisions and maybe students can type their notes on their laptops. But the principle is the same. So I don't expect many differences. I am just worried about the content of the subjects. I fear today's cancel culture because it leads to totalitarianism.

First, I think there are many things more important than exercise, one of them is eating. Not every way of eating is more important than exercise. It must be a specific way of eating, such as eating healthy food like vegetables, fruit, and anything except junk food. But it may be better if you do these two things together. I think if you don't want to exercise or exercise makes you bored and you don't want to exercise anymore in your life, Eating might be a good solution for you. If you have a question like, "What kind of food do I need to eat if I want to be a truly healthy person?" then I will tell you right now. As I mentioned before, not all kinds of food would help you. The bad kind of food is something we call junk food. Junk food is the bad kind of food that I don't want you to eat if you want good health. I will recommend you to eat food like vegetables and fruit as much as possible.

In my opinion, the internet have many influence people. It can influence many people to travel abroad to another country. The number of travelers may increase with the impact of the internet. All around the world will be full of many travelers. This can make travelers bored when they come to a place that is filled with many people. I think it is very annoying if you go somewhere that is full of people. It is important when you travel you won't expect many people in one place but it can happen this time. Second, someone thinks that if we have better technology, like visual simulation that can give the real experience that mean exactly like you go to the real place. I think it can make many people not want to go and travel and face a lot of crowds all over the world. But, if many people think like this and stay in their home other people will go to face the outside world.

It wouldn't be holiday to me if I just lay on the beach and did nothing other than eat, drink, and sleep. I need to stay active even on my holiday. So one of the best holidays I ever took was a few years ago in southern Czechia. I went there with a great group of friends. We spent a few days at the Lipno dam. There we hired bikes and during the day we were cycling through the beautiful Šumava mountains. After a few days, we replaced the bikes with canoes and went down the river Vltava for the rest of the week. So after a few days of cycling that were quite gruelling, we switched to more relaxing canoes in sunny weather. The best thing about going down a river like Vltava is that it is not a boring activity, but it is not too demanding either, so you can afford to have a great time and drink a little. In the end, it was one of the best weeks I can remember. I know that it can't be repeated, but I hope that I will be able to undertake something new in a similar spirit.

I am writing to you regarding your question about the general practitioners (GB), who would rather work in the cities. I guess, that one of the major reasons is that those doctors would prefer to get a lot of money for their efforts. The second reason, about which I usually think, is that they are people who could study hard to get certificates, however they could not yet learn enough about good manners, which every one especially a GB must have. The general practitioners are rarely not kind but some of them need to be brought up by their parents well, because neither do schools teach them personal personality nor do the universities. I think, the quickest solution for this matter is that the universities should have school subjects that encourage the student to be good guys, who can do some good deeds for no reason but to be good doctors. I would mention one more reason, before I close this blog. The governments usually build the hospitals in the cities, that is why the GBs like working next to the hospitals, which they worked in before. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to write my opinion.

Hello everyone, I am writing to you concerning your question about workstation building types. I think there is no need for any employee in any career to have noise during his work. In other words, if the employee has noise, he will have a disadvantage at his work and he won't be able to do his work as properly as if he has a quiet working environment. It might be better for the employees to move from one section to another one to bring or to get something from other company sides but it is such a tiny advantage in comparison to the disadvantage of having noise at work. In the case of having independence from others' desires to listen to the radio or speak with each other, it can be divided by having walls between the rooms or between the workstations. If the fabric has walls between the sections, the doors can be opened or closed. However if there are no walls, the space must be always open and the noise can easily be heard by the co-workers, who work relatively far away from the noise resources. I thank you for giving me a chance to express my opinion.

Hello everyone, I am writing to you concerning your question about volunteer work. Some careers are highly dependent on society. The employees and the workers, who have to work with people, should be tested in many, if they are nice enough to deal with people. Sometimes the employees are harsh. Those kind of people are not suitable to work in some careers. The beauty of a society can be shined by testing those people before graduation. Otherwise the harsh people can be employed by an institute, school, university or an organisation, which need nice people more than engineers and well graduated people. Nowadays some graduate students do not have anything to do with their families, their friends, their neighbours or their colleagues. In this case they live like robots and do not have enough emotions to show the consumers or the clients a smile. They just do their tasks like a machine. In some cases the employers are not able to test the employees during the interview, that is why the preparation of a good generation of kind and nice employees is upon the shoulders of universities and institutes. Otherwise some countries could be beyond modern in comparison to others not because of the newest technologies but because of the kind and suitable people who work in suitable places. Those people can lead the organisations to help people, not to damage them. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my opinion about this matter. This issue is not easy to think about, but it is such an important one to discuss.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you concerning your interesting question about music classes. I have asked myself several times, what did music classes gave me during primary and secondary school? I unfortunately always answer the same answer. NOTHING. Really nothing. If I were allowed to go home and rest, it would have been an encouragement for me to learn more or to finish my homework early. If the music class were a class during which the student could ask questions, the student would not have wasted a lot of time asking their parents to solve some complicated issues in the evening. Someone may say, "What if a student wants to be an artist?" Well, every single young student was bothered by teaching him music due to one or two students and he was not able to recognize that he was losing months and years from his most important time ever. Otherwise, if the school taught the students everything they need in their future, the school would have many more classes every day to fulfill their desires. If someone says that music is fun, the response to this expression is that sport is more fun for the students and it is healthy. The students who dislike music are many more than the students who dislike sport. If someone says that we have to change every class the students do not like, we will change more classes. The reply to this expression is that there is a big difference between teaching the kids to brush their teeth despite hating it and it is healthy for them and teaching the kids how to kiss dogs and cats and it is not healthy at all to do it. I thank you for giving me this opportunity.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you regarding your question about students' living places. I think every choice has pros and cons. It is difficult to say that one option is definitely better than another one. Living on one's own has some advantages. For example the students are more free and independent from their families. They can organize what they want to do during their days. However they have to manage everything they need at home. For example washing, cleaning and buying the necessary things. If the students can live with other students and they can learn from each other, it will be not too difficult to pass the examinations. Living with the family may be a good thing to do if the student likes communicating with people after uttering his tasks. But if the family does not have time to speak with him, the situation will be the same as if he lives alone. It depends on the study the student does. It takes too long if every study section has to be explained. At the end of the day every student must find the best way to make his study easy to graduate in. I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to utter my opinion about this issue.

One of my favourite activities is sleeping since almost always, I sleep. I will have a dream. Dreaming is like my second world. I can do everything in my dreams. Every day I sleep around 8-10 hours.

If I sleep with other people who can't sleep in a dark room, I'll get some fabric usually, my scarves closing my eyes so it reduces the light. Mostly, I don't have any problem with noises. I can sleep even among crowds. Nevertheless, sometimes I can't sleep because of a light disruption. But it happened rarely.

Despite all of that, generally, I like a dark and quiet room.

A number of people probably think that they should be honest all the time as much as possible. However, those people, from adults to children, need to tell a lie sometimes and I believe it is essential for human beings to do so as well. In the first place, there are a few people who would like to tell lies in many cases. For example, a worker was late for the meeting due to the fact that he or she could not wake up that day. If they told their manager the truth honestly, they might have a problem. However, the only thing they need to say is they were late because of transport or something, which might not make the situation worse. In the second place, people tell a lie to loved ones, such as a member of the family or a friend, if necessary. To give an example, many husbands may buy a gift for their wife as a surprise after work by saying that he would not come back home by dinner time. That moment will enhance the relationship among family members. Finally, when people think they should be polite to others, they need a lie. For instance, one of passengers on a train may give their seat to an elderly or pregnant woman, even if they are tired and they will say, "Please have a seat." That can be treated as a white lie. In conclusion, people may tell a lie even if they are not willing to. However, in my opinion, I am convinced that telling a lie could take a major role in our lives if they make use of it properly.

This is a hard question to answer. I will try to answer. Let's focus on the two options. Living a long life is maybe the best choice, because it does not go far from what our real life is. Yes, it is very comfortable because you know you can do whatever you want without any consequences. You will grow up very slowly, make a family with your lover, you have also a lot of time for searching for your dream job. Instead, having a shorter life is a choice that everyone will probably make. Because it can make you a cool guy, but it is not so for me. I think that what you can do in a short period of time you will be able to do it much better in a long life time. For example, I imagine a short life with a lot of trips across the world with my friends or other people but I know that I do not need a short life to enjoy these trips. I will probably choose to have a shorter life only if someone promises to turn me into a famous person that can change something in our world or do something that can help a lot of people. In conclusion, I choose to continue living my life as it is now.

In my case, I really need a quiet room and no light at all. Before I get into a deep sleep cycle, I can stay awake easily and it takes quite a long time staying in bed before I literally sleep. Usually what helps is reading a book and turning off all your electronic devices, because they produce a chemical substance in our brains that keep you awake. There are people who suggest nature sounds playlists to help them to sleep and relax, as an example, rainforests or waterfalls. I guess there's no silver bullet for the ideal sleep, every body has a different system and the trick is to learn how your own works.

It's not food that you eat as the main dish. This food is more like a snack but a heavy one. The main ingredients of Seblak are kerupuk, chilli and aromatic ginger. Kerupuk is like a chip made from tapioca flour. We use the raw one. Usually, I add onion and garlic to level up the taste. I like Seblak because it's spicy. I use many chillies because I love the hottest of spicy food. The other thing is there is a unique taste from the aromatic ginger. For your information, I use the same seasoning to make many menus, as I like the taste of Seblak. I used to eat the food almost every day during my rest time from the class.

The phenomenon of globalization and the recent improvement of public transport have increased people's desire to start learning new foreign languages. Compared to the past, learning new foreign languages ​​is now more important than before because today's world is much more competitive and faster than in the past. The market has become global rather than local with a high desire for highly specialized workers with a good knowledge of foreign languages. Nowadays, workers should know at least two or more foreign languages ​​if they want to make a career and be competitive. In the past, it was only true for a small circle of workers, such as scientists or those who wanted to work in the academic field in general. Learning new foreign languages has become important these days also due to the recent improvement of transport.

I think that students don't need to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Being a volunteer, you have to do it voluntarily, no one forces you to do that. Maybe there are some students who disagree with that opinion but they have to do it because they want to graduate. In high schools, students have to study a lot, teachers give them lots of homework. They don't have time to rest, so when could they go volunteering? If you want them to be a volunteer, first don't give them the requirement:" Students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate." Just tell them that, "Being a volunteer is optional." If you want to, do it. If you don't, no problem." Secondly, you have to pay a certain amount of money appropriate to their volunteer work. They will have energy to be a volunteer because, no one in the world will do anything without something paid back. Third, decrease their homework therefore they will have time for volunteering. The time they are volunteering becomes happier and meaningful, if you organize some games. Whoever completes this work fastest will get extra money. They will be interested in their jobs and volunteers will increase suddenly.

The transport sector has started to fundamentally change the way people will move. We can expect vehicles to drive autonomously without any human interaction and to be as comfortable as our home in the future. For ordinary journeys, vehicles with internal combustion engines, normally powered by fossil fuels, will no longer be used because electric vehicles will replace them. An advantage in the use of electric motors will be the possibility of having a quieter city with cleaner air, two key aspects nowadays. Among ordinary people, we shouldn't expect changes as shown in science fiction movies; flying vehicles will not be driven by everyone. Currently, flying vehicles are only used by astronauts with the aim of space exploration, but in the future, people will be able to travel from one planet to another to spend some days on holiday or for business affairs.

English is now the second language of many people living in Europe, America, and Asia. Governments pushed the learning of the English language several decades ago and it is now referred to as a "lingua franca." It means that it is commonly used as a means of communication by people of different native languages. Learning English has become important because the business and travel sectors started to support and promote it and without its knowledge, you are now left out. From a business point of view, English is used in everyday life to communicate with clients or prospective clients, give support, advertise, and even communicate with colleagues within the company in large corporations. Today English is a highly sought-after skill and has become the minimum requirement in many job applications. Analyzing the traveling side, English has become the "Swiss army knife" because it can be used to travel across countries with different native languages ​​without the problem of the language barrier. English can be used to ask for information, ask for help, or just order food and someone on the other side can understand you. English has made our life easier.

The purpose of television, in the historical moment we are living, is mainly to be a source of entertainment and less to be used for educational purposes. When television was created, the aim of the invention was to replace the radio, which was used as a means of communication to inform about the events of the day and to broadcast radio programs such as concerts at certain times of the day. In the past, broadcasters started to invest in television programs that were not just for entertainment and news purposes, but also programs to educate children and adults. The reason why TV broadcasters moved in that direction may have been due to the educational level of the people who lived at that time. Using television as a means of education works, but today the situation is completely different and we have many ways in which we can learn new things. Human creativity has been able to create successful television shows that can teach people of all ages, but that's not the future of television. The purpose of television in the future will be primarily for entertainment only, as evidenced by the television content we can see today.

I feel comfortable learning new areas, like English or science because they have topics that are very interesting for me. I have a lot of problems with English. I have been studying since two years ago and I feel that I have many problems with it. This is an area that I would like to improve because knowing English is very important when you have a job like mine. You depend on English because you have to talk with other people that don't speak Spanish and you must know how to communicate with them. It is also important because if you want to travel to another country you need to know how to speak English. This is a matter of establishing a fluent conversation. In fact, and in global terms, learning English is something that I can master because it has become like a part of my life and part of my daily routine. I believe that I am going to learn more languages when I finish learning English. The third question is very important because many people want to learn something, but they don't make any effort to fulfill that and I think that if you want to achieve something you need to make an effort and sacrifice a lot of things to achieve that. So I study every day, I dedicate many hours of my daily life to improve and to learn something new. I am also practicing because if you only study the theory but you don't practise then you are not following the best methodology because you must practice a lot if you want to be the best. Successful people had to work very hard to get their goal and you are going to have many obstacles, but you need to be persistent and you never give up because the magic moment is going to come.

In my opinion, school will be much the same except they will just improve a lot of the new technology for education. The teachers will always need for the student for improving the activity with each student. Students will still go to learn at school, the same as today. The difference, as I mentioned before, is the school of the future will need the new technology, such as AI, robots, and VR to improve the way of learning. I think in the future teachers and students will need to interact in the same way as today. Their conversation with each other will always help the students learn how to be social. I think in the future play time will be longer than learning time because students can learn everywhere. Then, we need the school in the future just to be for the teachers and students to come to talk to each other, rather than for learning as it is today.

Once I went with my family to a department called Rivas. We went to visit to my wife's relatives and we went with our children. It took us two hours to arrive and we left home at 5 am. The place that we visited is very interesting because there are many animals, like cows, horses, and monkeys and the landscape is so beautiful because there are many trees and mountains. When we arrived at that place the first thing that we saw was a river and it was very big and its waters was crystalline. The place was covered by nature and you could feel a sensation of peace in the environment because you were surrounded by many beautiful things. After that we went to the place where my wife's relatives were and in that place I had the opportunity to ride a horse, and we also drank milk fresh from the cow. We walked around the mountains in the afternoon and we decided to take several photos of that beautiful landscape. My children were very glad because they had never seen a similar place. I think that was the best moment of my holidays because I had the opportunity to spend a nice time with my family.

There are plenty of aspects to consider when deciding whether always telling the truth is something positive or negative. Among these, might be the situation we found ourselves to be in, the level of trust with the other person or for your own sake. To start with, it is undeniable that everybody has, at least once in their life, told a lie, nevertheless, besides common situations such as when a friend asks you if you like their T-shirt, not saying the truth could end up as you least expected it. For example, and most likely, when the other person finds out you have lied to them, and it only gets worse if that person is a teacher, your family, or another authority. On the other hand, lying is almost always the key to lose the trust and respect of someone, as a result, being aware of the consequences of your dishonesty is an important point to consider before acting. Although it should be said as well that sometimes we do not have a choice. Last but not least, the impact that telling the truth might have on us should be mentioned too since we inevitably, now and then, need to look after ourselves and tell some lies to protect ourselves. As long as that does not become a habit or your intentions are not two-faced. After those reasons have been exposed, in my opinion, I do think that lying or hiding things is acceptable in certain scenarios.

In my opinion, television can entertain and also educate because I think it can do these two things together. But if we need to do it together I think it is harder than just entertaining or just educating. It needs to be thought about very carefully. When you go to use something with the purpose of educating you need to be careful in every aspect of what you use. If you are not careful with what you are representing you can make the worst mistake, and it also causes you enormous trouble. There are many ways to combine it together, such as using it in the way of animation. If you want to make children to understand it better, animation is a good way to catch the attention of children. A game show is more interesting if your audience are grown-up people. It is fun and easy to give useful information to them.

To avoid the harmful influence of an inflexible and lazy lifestyle on health, it is said that all university students and school children should be compulsory to do sports activities three times per week or more. From my perspective, I back up this idea for its many benefits in the long term. People could easily see many health benefits when the plan is applied in school just in two weeks. It doesn't matter what sports activities they do, they will get fit in many ways. University students can play some sports which require strength like football, basketball or swimming. In that way, their stamina will be enhanced and their muscle will be tightened, which might facilitate their schoolwork. School students can do lighter sports like aerobics, badminton and tennis. There are also mental sports such as playing chess, Sudoku or meditation which will relieve study stress and anxiety effectively. So, doing sports activities will provide them with physical and mental strength so that they can have better performances at school. Another benefit of being active is that students can build up their relationships and enhance their teamwork skills. When they take part in sports activities, they have a chance to make friends and cooperate with other students to practise. As a result, their relationships will be broadened which may bring them many opportunities in the future. Moreover, in the playing sports process, students will learn how to deal with problems that arise with other people. That means their teamwork skills can improve a lot. Moreover, playing sports frequently can lessen students' time on surfing the Internet and increase their time outdoors. These days, students tend to be indoors and play video games more than they were in the past, which can lead to their bad habits. But when they do sports instead of wasting time on social networks, they can experience many things and be closer to reality. In conclusion, doing sports activities can lead to many benefits in the future and make people's time more worthwhile. Students can gain more experience and become healthier in their lifestyles.

I have recently discovered I failed the English exam that I took in the last exam session and after the disappointment lasted a few days, I started searching online how to deal with the problem. I was mainly focused on finding a method for improving my English writing skill without spending too much money, and in the search engine's top results I found a platform called "Write & Improve." It is a platform provided by Cambridge in recent years to provide the user with a trustworthy method for testing your English writing skill for free. The platform has several sections based on the English level or the certificate the user would like to do, and each section has thousands of examples including emails, essays, and reviews. The key feature of "Write & Improve" is the possibility to check the text whenever the user wants, multiple times, and without human interaction. This is an advantage that similar platforms do not have or are normally provided as premium features. The check of the text is done in a few seconds and gives you an insight into what can be improved and the current level of the text. The tips given by the platform don't contain many details and this could be a downside of the platform because for beginners it is important to understand well what the mistakes are and how they can be overcome efficiently. I consider "Write & Improve" a good starting point for learning English, but since it is meant for testing only one of the English skills and I recommend using additional tools during the learning.

Nowadays, it is quite common for students to live on their own while attending university, especially in prestigious universities where the selection requests come from all parts of the world. For most of the students, it is the first experience in their life where they have to look at themselves and do tasks normally done by their parents such as cooking, cleaning the room, and paying bills. The interesting idea of living on their own while attending the university is the experiences you may have with the students who live with you. It is not common for college students to live alone, however, it is more common to live in facilities such as dorms or shared houses where the student has their own room and some shared rooms where they can socialize with each other. The idea of a group or fraternity is the most attractive thing to most college students because it can lead to good memories to remember at the end of the experience. Living with our family is a good option when you would like to save money since living in such structures is really expensive. It is affordable for many people, but still not for all of them. I personally have experienced both experiences and I would recommend all the university students to move away and live on their own because, after the initial moment of difficulties, I experienced moments impossible to live at home with my family. The time passed with the other students was an important moment of growth fundamental in the life of a person.

Volunteer work is an aspect of everyday life really well appreciated by many people that can be done in many different ways. The activities normally performed in volunteer work could consist in working for some local institutions normally involved in helping people in a difficult situation or in working for the municipality, but the goal is always to involve the volunteer to work on the social side. This is mostly an extracurricular activity not recognized by schools, but some high schools started to propose volunteering as a requirement that students must meet for graduation. This proposal recalls what is normally done for some university degrees, where university students have to carry out a few hours of internship to graduate. Personally I approve the proposal of these high schools because volunteering is fundamental in this selfish and fast world dominated by the idea of thinking only of ourselves. It is an opportunity to start to understand for real the everyday problems of our city and start to understand how we can help others. Plenty of times, people live in a place for years without noticing some of the details, and sometimes even by convincing ourselves that these details aren't problems. Volunteer work, meant as the experiences in public life, should open people's eyes to bring them back to reality. These experiences are really important for personal growth and enrich and influence us for better choices in the future.

Life is the most significant thing in the world. While some creatures live a short life, some can live a long life. Most people prefer a long life. Even though most people prefer to live long, I prefer a shorter but more energetic and fascinating life. First of all, if people live a very long life without any beautiful experience, then this life is just a pain. Some prisoners, for instance, must live in a small and dark room till they die. A study shows that those prisoners would choose to live only one day with their family than live in prison until they die. They did not choose to live in prison until they die, but they choose only one day with their family. This study proves that people tend to choose a short but intense life. Secondly, when people get older, problems begin to get bigger. The elderly cannot do the same things they used to do. That is why I prefer to live everything when I can do it. If I do not live life now, I cannot live it when I get older. To sum up, I prefer to live a shorter but much more intense life because I believe that the most significant thing in the world is life. If we wait to live life until we get older, we will miss various amazing and unique experiences.

When I was in high school, I had a dream to move away and live a life alone. Of course, I didn't have any idea about how difficult it would be to live away from my parents, but I had the most important: the wish to know new places and new people. Because of that, I have studied a lot and could start a college in another city called Campinas. It's a city nearby my hometown, so I thought this localization would be the best for me, because I would have the freedom I've always wanted and my parents wouldn't be so far if I had troubles and needed them fast. While I was living in Campinas, I noticed I needed to learn a lot of things to survive, such as cooking, cleaning the house on the weekends, paying the bills, etc. In the first moment, it scared me, because I hadn't been prepared for this moments. But as the time passed, I could handle that and found time to enjoy my new life. I made new friendships, travelled a lot, self-accepted my sexuality, etc. Actually, when I look back at this moment in my life and compare it with friends of mine who stayed in their hometowns to study, I see how much I've grown and how it was important to make me who I am today. Thus, if someday someone asks me which choice is the best, I'm going to say: the harder one.

As the technologies are getting more and more advanced, people nowadays live easier and sedentary lifestyles. Hence, I agree with forcing university students and school children to do sports at least three times per week. First of all, society is educated that exercising is beneficial but we do not see the impact on students and children. They need to be obliged to exercise in order to realise the importance of exercising regularly, which is three times a week. This is because when they start exercising, they will feel more accomplished and healthy, and finally understand the gain of exercising and being active. There is also scientific research that proves the effectiveness of forcing someone to carry out certain activities in order to realise and understand the positive consequences that will be brought. Secondly, not everyone is disciplined. Hence, by implementing this act, they will be compelled to exercise which will achieve the goal of wanting more children to be active. The neglect of the activity of the youngsters will only engender more unhealthy issues to arise. I understand that we should allow them to exercise willingly to reduce the resistance towards it, but pampering students and children by obeying their needs and wants will only impact them negatively, for example, they may have obesity if they are sedentary. So, if we truly care for them, we should take actions to hinder the unhealthy problems from arising. In my opinion, I think that we mustn't only force them to exercise. We can also reward them to keep the children motivated to continue exercising. As an example, we can give them healthy and delicious snacks to alleviate their mood from feeling blue and weary after exercising. We must treat them well as we need to respect the children at the same time. In a nutshell, I pen down in writing that we must strike a balance in implementing this act of forcing the students and children to exercise. I recommend that encouragement and obligations of exercising be done at the same time.

I started using a new learning tool to improve my written English called Write and Improve. This website in my opinion is quite useful to improve your English. It has a huge variety of topics to write about and different levels of difficulty to choose from, besides it has a big community of users where you can make new friends and help each other to enhance your written English. To use this website you just have to register, thereafter you can select which level of difficulty you want to choose. It has Beginner level, Intermediate level and the hardest one is the Advanced level, furthermore it also has a Business section and a random section called Just for Fun. I also saw that you can do some tests, however I can't speak about it due to the fact that I have never done one, although in the following days I have decided to do some of them. The only downside that I could find was the auto-corrector, since I would rather have my text corrected by a teacher, for the reason that he can give me a feedback and help me to find the mistakes that I might have made, besides he can aid you to find solutions to these mistakes. However, in general terms I think that Write & Improve it's a wonderful tool for practising your written English and enhancing it.

Hi Chris! Me and my family are going to the local museum next Saturday and I am so excited to hear that you are interested as well. It has been a while since the last time I have visited that museum. Unfortunately, it is really far from my house so me and my family will have to drive for an hour to get there, Luckily for you, the museum is extremely close to you so you will be able to arrive in no time. The museum is about World War 1 and World War 2. It shows the weaponry used in those wars and it explains in great detail about their evolution through the wars. In addition, they have maps and uniforms which were used by the soldiers but the main attraction is the weaponry. I suggest you bring some money with you because, at the museum, there are a lot of souvenirs. On top of that, there are a lot of places where we can eat something and you will need some money. Also you should bring cash because it is easier to use. I am looking forward to seeing you at the museum. Best of luck! Sebi

Everyone in this world is good at and interested in different areas. This person loves art but that person loves playing video games. Why do we have that difference? Because each of us is a different individual. No one can force anyone to love this or that. We have different opinions, thoughts, hobbies. So that's why we have to respect others' opinion. Back to our problem. Like I've said we are completely different individuals, no one is exactly the same as another. So I think that studying music or learning about a musical instrument must depend on the students. We can't force them to do the thing we want. What do you think about students who don't like music having to spend 2 or 3 hours of their time to do the thing that they super hate? Meanwhile they can do homework for 2 or 3 hours. If you are in that position, do you agree? If schools don't have enough money to open a music class, we can recommend students to go to another music class. I think we have to create a survey. Then we'll base it on the percentage of students who love music. If the students love music more, so we create a music class. If the percentage is less than the students who don't love music, therefore we don't open a class.

I like to sleep in the dark. I do not like noise. When the weather is cold I like to use two blankets and I usually wear pajamas, by the way, I don't like to use a pillow on my bed. When the weather is warm I use only one blanket and I don't wear pajamas. Sometimes I like to sleep listening to relaxing music, by the way, I prefer to sleep on the left side of my bed. I can't sleep if there is so much noise.

We live in a historical era where the medical sector has made huge steps in the direction of keeping you alive for 100 and even more years. The lifestyle and the diet we follow in our lives are two of the main factors that influence our life and for living a long life you must make sacrifices. I am a person more into the idea of living for a shorter time but much more intense instead of living for long and calm life. In my mind, the idea I have for a long, quiet life is for something with no experience and no risk. Experiences are key moments in every person's life and are good times for personal growth and to be a better person in this selfish world. I can't imagine myself in a quiet life without the crucial experiences that have completely changed my life. Living abroad in a country with a completely different culture from mine or the idea of moving from my hometown to study at the university that I have always dreamed of had some risks of destabilising my life, but are intense and unforgettable experiences that I would do again.

In recent years, the number of doctors has started to decline due to the limitation imposed by universities on the inclusion of new doctors in the medical field and the large number of doctors who have started to retire. The few doctors who still are in service prefer to work and live in cities where they can earn a lot of money and where there are services that nowadays are considered essential. The rural areas are the most damaged in this situation because there aren't enough doctors in most of them and the medical service may disappear in future. We live in a world where most doctors work only for money purposes and the passion of helping people is in few of them. Governments should work in the direction of changing and improving the rural areas to facilitate and tempt the transfer of new doctors. An additional thing governments could do is to apply tax reductions for doctors who want to work in rural areas since most of them move to places where they can earn as much as possible. Tax reductions can also include reimbursement of certain expenses such as gasoline or public transport passes if doctors live far from the clinic.

In the past, sports activities were the only way to have fun for most university students and school children. The recent improvement in technology has introduced a new way to have fun beyond sports, but at the same time, the number of people who started to be inactive has increased. Recent studies have also highlighted that the correlation between technologies and inactive lifestyles is more present in younger people than in other age groups. Governments started to manage the critical situation and have proposed forcing college students and school children to do sports activities at least three times a week. For many schools and universities, the proposal is affordable and can be applied with minimal effort as the necessary facilities already exist and its management does not require much effort. The government's proposal is interesting and I consider it as the best way to contrast the bad habits and lifestyles of many students. At the same time, I disagree with the number of times they should do such activities. It is important to let students develop their hobbies and interest by allowing them enough spare time, and the proposal doesn't consider this idea. Doing sports activities at least three times per week would force students to spend too much time at school without allowing students to think more about themselves and their real interests. The students' engagements and interests should be more respected, and I have always thought that the imposition of the rules with the force only produces the opposite result. I would suggest governments rethink their proposal and start being more realistic. The corrections I would make take into account the reduction in the number of times students should perform their sporting activities and the voluntary basis for carrying out the activities. I know that forcing people to do sports is the only way to stimulate them to counter their bad habits, but less active activities are also important and sport should be more of an addition to our life and not a real obsession.

When talking about mobile phones, it is a very common thing for modern people. Because of the phone we can enjoy various kinds of convenient technology. But there are some negative effects that show up at the same time. For example, people walk on the street and use their phone. This is very dangerous thing not only for himself or herself but also the driver next to him or her because when the walker pays attention to the phone, they may not see a car going through and it is easy to have a crash. Therefore I think the government can build a policy to restrict using phones when they are on the road. It can be a punishment of money or a safety class to instruct them about the security. But there are some convenient things that need using a phone on the road, like taking a phone call, sending a message, or even booking a restaurant for a sweet date when you forgot to book it before you went out. It is very important that the goal of the policy isn't used to ban everything about the mobile phone but just prevent public people from dangerous accidents happening on the road. To sum up, I support the government restricting the mobile phone by building the a policy which won't cause inconvenience for us.

My favourite season of the year is summer. The reason that I like summer is because of the warm weather, the school vacation, and the endless fun. I really enjoy the warm weather because it’s the perfect atmosphere to do outdoor activities. My favorite part about summer has to be the fact that school is closed for 2 1/2 months. Summer time is a great time to relax by myself by soaking up the sun at a beach or simply having dinner. The summer season is the best time for festivals and activities. I can never get bored on a summer day and night. During the day, there are a lot of fun activities, such as swimming, sports, picnics, and barbeques. During the night, I watch fireworks on the 4th of July, go to a fair, and see a movie. I spend a lot of time by myself during the summer. There is a lot of good food, drinks, and fun music.

There are 2 kinds of people in the world, those who like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old, and those who prefer a shorter life but much more intense. The choice is hard, but after a long period of thought, I found myself preferring to have a short but intense life. The first reason is that I can make a contribution to society and the world in a short but intensive life. If I have a long, calm life, that means that I will only be an onlooker in the big events of the world, never to be someone that participated in them. On the hand, if I live a short but much more intensive life, I can have the chance to participate in events that changed the world, like discovering a cancer vaccine, inventing something that changed the world, or saving the world from destruction by foiling a villain's evil scheme. This is a major reason why I prefer a short, intense life. Second of all, I can have the satisfaction of having the knowledge that I helped and made a contribution to the world. If I live a long, calm life, I will die regretting not making a contribution to society. However, if I live a short life that is way more intense, I will die with the knowledge that I have made a useful contribution to the world in my life. This is also a major reason I prefer a short, intensive life. All in all, I would prefer to live a short, intense life over a long, calm life because I can make a contribution to the world and die with the satisfaction of knowing so.

We are living in times of social distance. People are worried about their health and the health of their family too. Despite this, we all have to work. Some companies have their offices where people share an environment. Some companies have s at the office, making small offices inside the room. The worker has his personal space to work in. In my opinion, not only because we are in the middle of a pandemic but also as a worker, I think a worker is more efficient when he works alone, the worker concentrates only on his job. Without a person to distract him, he can focus on his tasks and how to complete them efficiently. This kind of office is perfect for introvert people because they do not like to socialize while they are working. As I read in a famous book "every man has to have his own space, where he can discover himself." In my personal experience. I work in a quiet place. where I am able to work being one-hundred percent focused on my work. It helps me to do a good job and as a result I receive extra money when I make the company more profitable.

It is known by everyone that sleep is an important part of our lives and it should be offered the credit it deserves. Some people like to sleep in a dark and quiet room. However, other people like having a source of light in their room. So, which is my preferred way of sleeping? Firstly, I personally prefer to live in a noisy environment but I cannot fall asleep with a lot of noise in my room, so I like a quiet room. Secondly, falling asleep with a source of light in my room seems impossible for me. When I was younger I used to sleep with some light, despite the fact that I had issues falling asleep with it, but nowadays I sleep in a dark room. In conclusion, with everything said above, I personally prefer to sleep in a quiet and dark environment, but this is only my preference.

One survey from a famous magazine showed that a man tells more than twenty-one lies per day. Some people think that lies are normal in our society, others think that lies should be avoided. I think some kinds of lies are normal. A scientist did an experiment: for twenty days, he told only the truth. He lost all his friends, his relationship and job. It means that the truth is hard but sets you free. There are fake news, lies that people say on social media, this lies can be harmful to some people. I think that some lies may be acceptable. We tell some lies for convenience, to look attractive to a girl you like or during a job interview. The most common lie is when a person does not want to be punished for a mistake. I sometimes tell some lies too. Sometimes I receive invitations and I do not want to attend then I say I am busy at the moment but I am not busy. When you are in love you will always lie to impress the other person. It happened to me when I met my wife. I lied about little things to impress her. But as my mother always said lies do not last long and she knows me very well now. I think people can lie but their lies should not cause problems for other people.

As people, we have different behaviour and attitudes so when you are going to talk about the truth, in my opinion, the truth is always hard but we need to believe that the truth is best . In addition, there are lots of situations that you need to be honest and accept your destiny like when you finish high school and you want to decide what you want to do. Do you want to study at university or do you want to work? This decision needs thinking about carefully and after you decide you have to tell your parents your decision so you need to be honest with your family about your desire also you need to show them that you are responsible for your life. Sometimes you need to lie for some reason. For example, if you want to visit your friend and your mother accepted that so your friend tells you, "I miss you. Shall we meet on Sunday please for one hour?" In that situation you need to lie to your mother that you want to study for your exam so you need to go to the library and actually you want to meet your friend. I have mission you can lie, but not always, because if you keep lying I swear you will become a bad person and you shouldn't do that. Finally, I prefer to tell the truth because it is the best thing.

Telling the truth In our life we have a lot of things that we need to say especially in our daily conversations with our families, friends and so on. Many people, when they have problems in their work or even personal problems, lie to other people to avoid another but the thing is, lying to people could create other problems such as losing money or having problems in your life. As a result of that, telling lies to people can make you lose important relationships or lose a marriage and the problem could get worse if your lies affect other people and it might make them lose their life or sometimes even end up going to jail. For me, I believe that we always need to tell the truth. I know sometimes it hurts but on the other hand at least you will not lose someone's trust or you won't break someone's heart and telling the truth will always keep you on the safe side. You will be more confident, honest and brave. Bravery is not saving someone's life, only also if you tell the truth will you be a hero. For example, if you are a student at university and you have difficult exam and when the results are posted you got a D grade and your partners speak to you and say, "Honey, what did you get in your subject?" of course if you tell them the truth surely they will be mad but at least they will trust you.

Autumn is too wet, the weather is always rainy. And summer is a perfect season for the most exciting activities. We can go camping in a national park, or have a long vacation in another country.

It is generally known that health is what a person needs the most in the world to strive for great wealth and their future. Firstly, I would like to emphasize the idea that money cannot buy health despite having the ability to acquire the best medical system; however, money is earned through good health. If our health is affected by a grave disease like cancer or HIV, money could only provide the best treatments and doctors, but it could never give us back our healthy body. Secondly, I would like to point out that health brings us the opportunity to enjoy our life. For example, when we are healthy we can do all the things we like, such as going on holidays, doing some sports, gathering with family and friends, eating our favourite food, and so on. But if we fall ill, we are restricted from doing many of those activities in order to have a good recovery. Judging by the above mentioned, I can say that being healthy is the foundation we need to obtain everything in life and enjoy it, this includes having money. So health is a lot more important than wealth.

In the corporate world there are a lot of people working inside offices, from secretaries responsible for making and answering calls to executives deciding the future of a company. Companies have different office arrangements, some of them have open spaces while others keep their employees working inside cubicles. But, what is the best alternative when talking about office arrangements? An open working space provides more interaction between workers as everyone is seeing each other all the time, so communication flows easily, indeed the lack of physical barriers make the subordinates feel free to talk to their bosses because these physical obstacles can also work as psychological boundaries between workers of different levels. The cubicles also have their roles inside a company as there are some activities that requires deep concentration, so any noise can affect the effectiveness of who is doing the job. Big companies also deal with projects with a high level of secrecy in which any leak of information can be dangerous to their strategy. As mentioned before I don't believe there is an exclusive option, but the one suited best for the type of work that is being done. The thing is, when designing an office, a company needs to know what kind of work will be done there to make the best choice. I also believe offices can have the two arrangements combined using alternative ways to reduce the existing boundaries while also keeping the needed secrecy of some jobs.

In this flat world, every country has to open up to the world if that country wants to push itself forward. So, a bridge to connect to the world is language. English, not by word, was chosen to become a globalization language, no country can deny it. For example, the first president of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, chose English as the national language over Chinese. History proves that his choice was a brilliant move. People know they can communicate in English with businessmen from the Western world. Students know English enables them to learn with higher quality education material. In just two decades, Singapore became one of the four dragons in Asia with the highest living standards. So, if we want to become global citizens, we must learn English, especially for communication. In some companies, they only hire people that have an English certificate . Mastering the four English skills will give you an enormous opportunity to advance in your career and explore new horizons.

In this day and age a sedentary lifestyle has become more common among young people as they study a lot and a huge part of their social life happens online. As a result, kids and teenagers are less active, but it does not mean that they should be forced to do sports activities, at most, they ought to be encouraged to do so. Forcing someone to do sports from such a young age creates unhealthy mindsets towards physical activity which is then seen rather as a chore than a way to stay healthy. On account of this, people obligated to be active will have hard time finding sport enjoyable in the future, which can quickly cause them to fall off the wagon, resulting in an increase in obesity and other health problems connected with lack of movement. What is more, obligatory physical activity in schools and universities usually comes in the form of PE classes, where there are not many alternatives when it comes to things children and teenagers can do. Limiting kids' options to football, basketball, volleyball and other easy to organize games does not help them reach their full potential and discover their talents. It can also trouble kids who are not gifted when it comes to playing those accessible sports. Despite everything that has been mentioned, forcing young people to do sports three times a weak ensures that they keep their bodies healthy during demanding years of their development. In consequence, many diseases, characteristic for those of young age, can be easily prevented. All things considered, forcing a healthy lifestyle on kids has far more downsides than advantages and it should not be done by schools' authorities. All humans, despite their age, have the right to decide how they want to live their life. Children and young adults ought to be able to choose a healthy lifestyle, ideally following example that their parents have given them.

In my opinion, there is no point in living a long, calm life until 100 years, so I would rather live a shorter but much more exceptional one. Let us start this with a question, what would life be without a drop of adrenaline? Let me answer, it would be tedious. A life like the first one mentioned would be a basic one, in which someone already knows what is going to happen. That person would finish his studies, then will get a job, a family and will live in his beach house, where no one could bother him, until death comes. On the other hand, imagine having such an amazing life, in which everything is mysterious and everything could happen. Personally, I would try the best experiences, for example, swimming with sharks or anything like this that is insane. In such a life, there is no space for boredom. You could travel the whole world and try the best things that are possible only in some places. It doesn't matter that you won't live that long. At the end of the day, it is much more important what you have done rather than how long you have lived. As one of my good friends would say, everyone should think that after our deaths, we will remain just a memory in others' minds, so let us try to be a great memory. To sum up, I would prefer to live a much shorter life, but more intense, rather than a long and calm one.

Hello Peter, Yesterday I watched Kung Fu Panda in the cinema and I need to tell you that Kung Fu Panda is my favourite film right now, its genres are animation, action, adventure, comedy and family. I think you are asking what it is about. It's the story about a lazy, irreverent slacker panda, named Po, who is the biggest fan of Kung Fu, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of Kung Fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. You would really like this film. Good luck, Peter.

I think that a lot of things are going to change about travel in the future. For example, people are going to travel more quickly or people are going to be in another place virtually. Why do I think people will be in another place virtually? I think that because there is already an application which can do that. If you don't know you can search on Google maps for the application where you can visit other places around the world and you can find out about it. I know it is not the same experience as being somewhere personally, but it is an option that many people can have when they do not have enough money to travel. Today, many people are making a lot of videos about other countries where they receive money from YouTube for their videos, and I think that it is a good option to be able to pay for travel. Things that will not change are the ways people must interact with other people in another place around the world. I think that English will be the universal language to communicate with others. I think in the future the option to travel can be easier because you are going to have more option to choose which trip is more comfortable for you.

Both of the choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. My rule of making a decision between two things is to list the benefits and drawbacks and see which one has the most advantages so I'll choose it. First, I will talk about the benefits of moving away and living their own lives while they are university students. The period of ages of being a college students are between 15-18. At that time, their brains have developed and they are aware of what is right and wrong, knowing what to do and not to. In that moment, they're mature enough to replace their parents. If they still live with them, their lovely dads and mom will be their sources of corruption. Secondly, I'll talk about the advantages of students who live with their family. If they move away from their family so early, they don't have much experience of the current of life where there is intense contention. They will be safer if they live with their parents. Their mothers and fathers, who gained lots of experience, overcome many rivalries. They will share this with the students and guide them to the right paths. Thirdly, the disadvantages of living without family. I bet that you will feel lonely and unhappy because you got used to living with them. After that, you don't know where to start, you begin to be lost. Everything happens so suddenly that you can't handle it. It'll be better if you have already got your plan and carefully solve all kinds of problems through asking about your parents' experiences. Fourthly, the drawbacks of living with moms and dads. Parents always want their kids to be safe and do everything for them just because they don't want to see their darlings tired. But they don't know that costs the cost the corruption of the children. They'll be lazy and arrogant. One day, this society will teach them with insults, fired. Eventually, my choice is to move away from your family and set up your own life. It will be very hard, also difficult, at first but then after each failure, I can learn different lessons, so the next time I won't be like that anymore. The feeling of moving far away from your lovely members are full of sadness and loneliness. But you must overcome it. They can't live with you until the end of your lives. You'll have this feeling soon, so why not now? Therefore when it truly occurs that's terrible and you can overcome it easily. When your parents are young, they are the same as you so why could they do it and you can't?

As far as I'm concerned if somebody tells a lie, it is really terrible. There are many reasons that can bring this answer to me. Firstly, the person who often tells a lie will lead to that his or her friends hardly believe him or her. For a classic example, there is a fable about the boy taking care of the sheep and the wolf. The naughty boy thinks that it is very funny to say a wolf comes to eat the sheep. Because of that, all the residents living in the village walk out to protect the sheep from the attack of wolf. After the boy pranked the residents many times, the residents heard the boy calling for help again but all of them considered it as a joke and nobody went out to give him a hand. In the end, the sheep were attacked and the residents were very angry. So trust between people will be exhausted by lies. Second, when a person tells a lie, the person usually must tell others more lies to make the first one be reasonable. For instance, my friend, David, hung out with me but he didn't get his mom's assent. He also had a cram school going on the same time. Therefore he made a phone call to the cram school and took a day off. Unfortunately, the cram school called his Mom and his mom knew that too. Then he received a phone call from his Mom, so he told more lies to convince his Mom. But the truth will emerge some day. And he got quite a scolding. To sum up, being honest is the best way to live in the world.

In my opinion, I like to sleep in a dark and quiet room. There are some reasons for my choice. Firstly, I think when I sleep in a dark and quiet room, the quality of my sleeping will be improved. In a room like this, I can sleep more quickly than in a room with a small light. Secondly, I think if I sleep with some noise, I will be used to it. And if I set an alarm, maybe I can't hear it since I always sleep with the noise. However, when I sleep in a quiet room, not only can I sleep soundly, but also I can wake up on the first ring of the alarm clock. So, the reasons why I like to sleep in a dark and quiet room are improving the quality of my sleeping and waking up when hearing the alarm.

It's really hard for me to make a decision between 2 things, to my consideration they are both effective. But, maybe they're not. Let's analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each one. The advantage of working in enclosed workstations is you can have your own workspace. You'd feel more comfortable if you work alone. Let's imagine that you're thinking of a problem and how to solve it, but then when you look up and you see a bunch of people in front of you, maybe they don't do anything, but that could cause your thoughts to be interrupted. So if you're a boss, why don't you have separating walls? Therefore, your employees would a 100% focus on their work. But, everything in this world has 2 sides, including this. The disadvantage of working with separating walls is some people don't like this. They got used to working as a team. The most preventable is separating walls. They want, while they're working, to easily talk with their colleagues. We can't force them to like what we like, because each person has different opinions. The benefit of working without separating walls is like the drawback of working in cubicles. That will apply successfully if people in the offices are extrovert. It depends on the purposes offices want to achieve, so we have different solutions. The reason why I didn't talk about the drawbacks of working without separating walls is they are the advantages of working in cubicles. To me, I have made my own decision. I know that somebody will disagree with me because we're not the same. I prefer working in enclosed workstations. I don't know what type of human I am, extrovert or introvert. But I don't care. The thing I assure is that my thoughts will be not interrupted if I choose to work in cubicles.

It is often said that having a peaceful, long-lasting life and gaining lots of achievements are the things that many people desire. But we all know that it is not easy to get both of them or balance our lives in that way, so we have to strap something. From my perspective, I would like to live a long, tranquil life rather than a shorter, prosperous one. That does not deny the fact that no one is successful without trying hard and the reason behind that effort mostly is money which has high power for paying all the bills and securing a bright future for anyone. But all lives will end someday and people cannot be buried with their money. And the older people are, the fewer expectations they have. Their final purpose is happiness and calm with their beloved ones. So why we don't enjoy this while we are alive? Many people did not spend much time with their family members, close friends or their partners when they pursued their wildest dreams, which is the thing that they most regretted then, whether their dreams came true or not. We only live once and we rarely live as we should. So, learning to be pleased with everything we have and enjoy each minute passing by is the key to a happy life, not rushing into unreachable things. Moreover, if you live a long and peaceful life, there are a lot of interesting things ahead for you to go through. But if you live a short and intense life, you are likely to miss many things. On the other hand, living a calm life doesn't mean that you can have a decent life without doing anything. You still have to work to make enough budget to meet your family demands. In conclusion, you don't need to become a billionaire to be happy. Keeping in touch with your loved ones, close to nature, doing what you love is perfect preparation for your life.

Telling the truth is a favourable thing in the value and moral system of all communities around the world. In addition, telling the truth is an important element in all religious scriptures in which people believe. Telling the truth is the centre on which all other human values are based. We teach our children to always tell the truth no matter what it takes, because the opposite, which is telling lies, has very damaging consequences. Telling the truth can sometimes save lives of others as well as achieve justice for people who are oppressed by the criminal justice. Nevertheless, telling the truth is always a good thing because it enables us to respect others' rights and maintain their dignity. In medical ethics, clinicians must always tell the truth no matter what consequences might arise from it. For example, if a surgeon makes a medical mistake while performing surgery, he or she must disclose the truth of what happened during the surgery with complete honesty even if it will pose them worse consequences. Similarly, telling the truth is part of every other career environment. People often find themselves in situations in which they have to tell a small good lie to make a friend happy. I think such a small good lie may be acceptable as long as it does not hurt anyone or affect anyone's dignity and wellbeing. In conclusion, I would say telling the truth is a sacred value for almost all communities around the world, and I very much value it!

In my opinion, there are several questions about imposing volunteer activities as a duty on high school students. First of all, volunteer work is something that people do with awareness. For this reason, I am against making it compulsory. Second, there are no opportunities for students to learn why some people need volunteer work. Students may simply think of this activity as an obligation. In other words, this program takes away their ability to think about the meaning of their action. If a school's curriculum wants students to become aware of their environment and people in the community who need their help, it should not only impose the activity itself but also provide an opportunity to study the importance of the activity. For these reasons, I think that the high school should not handle volunteer work as a credit. I think that teachers should give students an opportunity to learn and work with them together in the field.

After graduating from high school, students usually apply for university. Some of them decide to stay in their childhood houses, others move out to start on their own, alone. Which option is the better one? Firstly, students who choose to stay with their parents are faced with less responsibilities. This can be really helpful, considering the amount of time one spends studying. Usually, parents pay for a living. The student does not have to work, therefore have more time to study. What is more, parents usually guarantee healthy food to eat. They cook, bake and make foods with healthy calories, which improves one's overall well being and condition. This way, the student's nourished brain works better and the student ends up with better grades. On the other hand, one's abilities to manage money or to learn responsibility drastically go down. That is because constantly living in comfort only leads to discomfort in the future life. Young people benefit from moving by learning a lot of practical skills which are later needed in adulthood. Students who move after graduating become independent much faster. To sum up, opinions diverge. I personally believe people should learn independence as fast as they can - it will make their future life easier.

There are many programs that are broadcast on television that can be educational programs, or they can be programs that are not available for children, but it will depend on what we as parents decide our children can watch. I believe that the responsibility is ours as parents, and we need to have control over what our children are watching. We can't prevent a television channel from broadcasting a specific program, but we can control what our children can see. I think it is something to do with education and education begins at home with all the examples we set for our children. Many times we can blame other people for everything bad that our children are doing, but the main responsibility is ours as parents and we must show them the right way. If we show them the good things that television gives us, I think that we will not have a problem with that because we should show them that television can show us documentaries or various things that we need to learn, and not everything is bad. Television is something that changes our life and the way that we are having fun right now.

In my opinion, it is more comfortable for office workers to spend their time in an enclosed space. First of all, because in an enclosed space, it is easier to concentrate on their desk work. Companies need to achieve their missions and earn money in order to pay their employees. For this reason, it is necessary for companies to provide their staff with a comfortable work place. Some people think it is not good to communicate with other members if employees stay in their compartment desk. But I can override this point, because there are many opportunities to share ideas by using mail or business meetings. Staff can communicate by using these tools or they can plan meetings. I think that is more effective for people who do not have enough time. Sometimes some people spend invalid time chatting with other members in open spaces. Moreover they can consider their ideas and present them to prepare for a staff meeting beforehand. For all of these reasons I think it is more effective to provide enclosed spaces for employees.

I will point out my view regarding the question whether I prefer working in cubicles or in an office with a more open design. At the beginning, every employee needs to be able to carry out his work. Thus, the colleagues must behave appropriately in order to create a conforme atmosphere. If this is the case, I do not see difficulties in offices whose design is more open, but rather advantages. Referring to this, the team spirit of the employees could strengthen and they could stand by their colleagues to compensate for their individual weaknesses. Additionally, the atmosphere would be more communicative and the personnel would feel more convivial. In contrast to this, the circumstances in cubicles are sometimes better, because office work matters a bulk of movement and a lot of conversation about various issues. This can be irritating for an outstanding person, who focuses on another task and hardly concentrates. Taking all this into consideration, I safely assume that this question can only be answered individually as it depends on the colleagues you have at work.

We are living in a society in which the number one cause of death are cardiovascular related diseases which are in terms mainly influenced by factors like activity and nutrition. This poses rightfully the question whether the national government should consider a mandatory sport membership in a sports club? Starting of with the legitimacy. Of course such a policy is considered to be a huge intervention in both parental autonomy and the freedom of the concerned child. However one can argue that in health related issues such interventions can be justified as it is already the case in other health care issues and preemptive medical examinations. Another often overlooked challenge is that new policies can result in social injustice and discrimination. Applying this to our case one notices a need for at least partial public funding of the activities or sports clubs in order to legitimate it. Also a social stigmatisation of untalented may arise. Looking at efficiency we have to ask us how well would such a policy induce the desired result without costing too much. Looking at costs might be quite simple if the policy shows any effect, expressed in lowering hospitalization rates at all, the net saving of health insurance costs already finance the regulation. However one has also pay attention to any bureaucratic challenges entailed by the supervision of such a regulation. Another argument against this case is that most cardiovascular related diseases only arise at a certain age and school children are virtually unaffected. The only thinkable benefit would be the building of healthy habits at a young age and the establishment of more prominent role of sports in our society in general. As you can see a similar regulation entails many potential consequences. And one important question remains unanswered, is the intervention in our children's freedom worth the possibly small benefits?

Dear town council, Although we all know about the downsides that the use of a mobile phones in public places or even in shops and restaurants can cause, such as distraction and accidents, the use of theses objects in my opinion should not be prohibited. In spite of the facts related above, there are many advantages to using mobile phones. Letu00B4s take the use in public transport as an example, we can take a long journey in some transport, and with the help of a mobile, we can work on things during this path. Observing now one example in a restaurant, imagine that you are a very occupied person, as I can imagine you guys from town council must be. If you didn´t have the help of these mobile phones, how many dinners and lunches would you have to cancel to attend an appointment? These technologies are here to help us to live better and more efficiently, so there is no doubt in my opinion that mobile phones should keep being allowed in these places . Even more, we can see our rights to be free to do whenever we want, as along as we don´t do something bad or disturb other people. To summarise, I believe this thinking of yours is completely equivocated, and should be revised before you make it public.

I think the more important thing is to be healthy, but I think you can't be healthy if you are not rich. If you want to be healthy there are many ways to achieve this, such as through exercise, eating healthy food, or following an influencer on social media who can teach you to be healthy. I think all these ways need a lot of money and time that you can't invest if you don't have money. I don't think we can view these two in a separate way as I said before, those two terms need to come together. If I can choose one of them, I will choose to be healthy because if I am healthy, it's because I am rich. In our old age we will face a lot of diseases and in this world where money is the most important thing, you need it to pay to cure your illness. That is why you can't be healthy if you are not rich.

A teacher is a critical factor in the process of education; if we have a bad teacher we may be hurt by him, and if we have a good teacher he will help us, but if we have a great teacher, then we will be inspired by him. The question of whether you prefer a teacher for several years or having a different teacher every year is complicated; we can't just answer yes or no, it is not that simple. My opinion is that it depends on two things. First and foremost, is he inspiring and compatible with the students? If yes, we can move on to the second question. Is he able to teach one class for several years? If the answer to the questions is yes too, then I think he can teach the class for several years. But to be honest, I believe that having one teacher every year is the best choice. Why? Because I had many great teachers over the years, if one of them had taught me for several years, then I would not have been able to know the others, which would be a disaster, because I learned something from each and every one of them. Their words are still in my mind, I can still hear them. To summarize, no, I do not think that having one teacher for several years is a good idea.

As one of the users of Write and Improve, I would recommend this learning tool to everyone who wants to study English writing. It is a useful and helpful tool, especially for those who are learning English on their own and are trying to check whether their writing is correct or not. When learning another language, it can be difficult to determine your own answers. For example, it's easy to learn reading and listening by solving a set of questions and checking the answers. Writing and speaking, on the other hand, have multiple correct answers due to the richness of expressions. The best way to check your writing and speaking expressions is to take lessons from a native English speaker, but it is costly. With Write and Improve, students can learn English in a more convenient and economical way. Write and Improve has the ability to determine the accuracy of sentences, but it can be difficult to understand why a sentence is incorrect. Sometimes students don't know enough to correct the sentences and need help figuring out why they are wrong. Therefore, I think this is one of the weaknesses in using Write and Improve. However, this great tool can help English learners who want to improve their writing skills.

Hi, Long time, no see. Regarding my favourite movie that you are asking me about in your letter, I think my favourite movie is '12 Angry Men'. I like this film. There is a lot of speaking in the scenes, maybe you think it is boring, but I recommend you watch it and then you will find all the dialogue is very impressive. It tells you about 12 members of a jury who need to discuss and find out what happened in a crime scene. In the beginning you will find it boring to listen to something that sounds obvious, but in the end you will be influenced by a man in the film.

I do like to exercise and I usually exercise at the weekend. But I don't want to spend my money at a gym because sometimes I feel tired and if I register at one and don't go there, it'll be a waste of money, for sure. So I often ride my bicycle at the park near my house instead of going to the gym. When riding a bicycle, I can also get some fresh air. And when I get tired, I can just sit on the sidewalk and watch people doing some exercise too. I think it's really nice.

I think it is better for college students to live with their families during their college years if they can commute to college from home. Firstly, it is more economical to stay at home and students can concentrate on their studies. Many students go to college to study, but some students are more into part-time jobs. It's hard to find time to study your major while working part-time. If you stay at home, your family will be there to support you. Secondly, living alone can be hazardous to one's health. Many students tend to eat irregularly and sleep poorly without the constraints of their families. To avoid this situation, it is a good choice to spend as much time as possible with your family. After finishing school, it will be more difficult to stay with your family. Probably all of you will start working, and some of you will have to go to your hometown by order of your company. Therefore, you will have to move and live on your own, whether you want to or not. For these reasons, I think it is better for me to stay with my family.

My one and only reason for learning English is to escape from my country. I want to establish myself in another country that doesn't have a monarchy and a dictatorship or a country that truly listens to the voice of all people. It is because English is a language that is used all around the world and if you need to go abroad or go to study in another country English is useful and you must learn it. If you don't, you can't live in another country. But my true feeling is that English is not as important as I always think. In recent months I have usually asked, why do I need to learn another language to live in another country? Why does someone not make a device that can translate one language to another language? Many people say it is hard to do such a thing, but I think humans can do such things. We need to abolish money that prevent the useful equipment to happen.

They have both benefits and drawbacks. First, let's look at the benefits. To begin with, students who live alone have a better grasp of their skills and self-control. They will recognize the difference between staying at home and starting to act on their own. This will also aid in the development of the student's self-esteem, allowing them to realize what is best for them as they mature into adults. It will also liberate them from the gaze of their parents, allowing them to experience freedom for the first time. The benefits of living at home with your parents at school are that you'll be able to communicate with them quickly and resolve any unpleasant issues that might arise. In a good relationship, students will feel safe with their parents. They will strive to help their parents by doing their duties. In my opinion, the university is a time when students must develop their understanding of the world and their place within it. They require their own space. However, students must have high self-esteem and never keep anything important from their parents to compensate for the disadvantages.

There has been a debate about video games. Some people think that they are helpful and fun, while others think they are harmful and may cause addiction. The truth is actually a mix of these two opinions. If we consider the first point of view we will see that it is true. Because according to recent studies surgeons who play video games are more likely to be skillful than surgeons who do not play video games. The other thing is that it can be a way to socialize, especially when played in teams. But let's take into account the opposite opinion. Video games, especially the ones that include violence, have a negative effect on their players' brains; and they reach their maximum harmful effect when played by children. The second bad influence video games may have is addiction. Addiction to video games is called behavioural addiction, it is similar to an addiction to lottery or masturbation, which makes video games a real danger, especially for children and young boys. My personal opinion is that video games are fun, but we should take care about what we let our kids play with, and how much time they spend playing; because kids do not know what is harmful or what is not, and that is our responsibility.

Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. In my opinion, this idea is absolutely reasonable. No one can deny that sports activities can undoubtedly do good for our health. Regular exercise can boost immunity. Regular physical exercise is not only good for physical fitness but also good for mental health. Research has found that students who exercise regularly are more positive and optimistic than those who don't. For all school children, doing sports frequently can help us improve concentration, which can help students gain better grades. What's more doing sports activities can improve students' team work. It can also enhance the relationship between students. So it is of vital importance for students to do sports activities. But there are different voices about whether exercise takes up time for study and leads to a decline in academic performance. From my perspective, it is reasonable to do sports at least three times a week. Doing sports activities three times per week is understandable. It can definitely help students resist the inactive lifestyle and form healthier life habits. Although not every student is interested in working out, they still should get regular exercise and get used to it. Take myself for example, I was a person who hated doing sports. Also, I am extremely fond of eating junk food, which led to my terrible health condition and bad grades. But everything changed when I started exercising. I work out more frequently than three times a week. Consequently, my studies and my physical health both improved. Above all, it has been proved that doing sports activities three times a week is of great benefit to students. And it is students' duty to take care of their own body and resist an inactive lifestyle.

If some tourists want to eat traditional food, there are restaurants where they sell Nacatamal, Vigoron and Gallopinto. For night-time entertainment in my city, there are different clubs where artists do jazz and hip hop shows. And for people who don't like shows and music there are theme parks.

Telling the truth is important, and you are told to tell the truth all the time. But sometimes we will have to lie for something good or to cover up something good for us. We call these lies "white lies." Telling a lie may hurt other people's feelings. That's what we know for sure. But is telling a lie that bad? We sometimes tell a lie before we even notice it. Telling a white lie is useful for not hurting people's feelings. Like your friend is getting married and is choosing a wedding dress. She loves it, but you hate it. Do you tell her that this dress is awful and choose one that she doesn't like, or tell her "You look great! But this one might be better." Things aren't the say we think they are. They are also used for comforting people. Telling your mother that her meatloaf is delicious when you hate the meatloaf. Telling your friend that she doesn't look fat in her dress when she asks because you don't want to tell her that she's gained a lot of weight and looks heavy. There are no rules of the game although Gould suggests that if a white lie requires additional white lies or hinders the expression of your personal needs then you should tell the truth. She suggests delivering honesty “with a side of gentleness.” It’s best, to be honest, to avoid having to lie again and again.

Nature is fascinating; that's why humans always try to get close to it. The problem is that humans use twisted ways in order to achieve this purpose; zoos are one example of these ways. A lot of arguments have taken place about zoos, and whether they are right or wrong. Let's take a look at the first opinion. It assumes that having zoos is a good thing, because people learn about animals. They get close to these creatures and interact with them. Plus, they argue that as long as the cages are clean and the animals eat properly then there isn't any reason to think it's wrong. The opposite point of view is opposed to the idea of putting animals in cages. They say that it is more suitable to keep them free in their natural habitat, and that keeping them locked up is decisive, even if we provide the right food and services for them. Both of these two opinions are valid; personally, I tend to lean towards the side that claims it's wrong. I do think that keeping animals in cages is wrong. When humans are being put in cages, it is wrong. So it should be the same case for animals. Animals have feelings too.

In my opinion, it is important for students to learn about music and how to play a musical instrument. There are two reasons. First of all, music classes support students in understanding not only the music but also the social context of why the music was created and loved. For example, court music in Europe has a lot of traditional manners and unique history. In those times, playing music was sometimes a way of gaining high status. Music is not just for fun, but it is a tool to obtain something or express one's feeling. In other words, to learn about music is to learn about our history. This enriches our knowledge. Second, it is difficult for us to study music on our own. Today, we can easily listen to a variety of music, but we rarely have the opportunity to understand it properly. Moreover there is a high cost of playing a musical instrument if we take a private lesson. Therefore, learning music is a valuable and economical opportunity for students. This is my idea for this topic.

Studying abroad is a beneficial opportunity for any student, and it is an experience that should be had at least once in a lifetime. And like any experience in the world it has advantages and disadvantages too; the most important advantage will be seeing other cultures and interacting with them. This interaction might be helpful, especially for people who are coming from poor countries, because it helps them see another world and other people, which may be a motivation for them to help their country more. The other advantage will be the trip itself. Travelling makes us see other people, other cultures, and other heritages. It is always great to see yourself than hearing about anyone. But there are always disadvantages too. First of all, it may be hard for some students to travel and be in another country with other people. This change of environment may cause a negative effect on some students, especially the introverts. Not everyone can handle this kind of change. As I said earlier, studying abroad is a great experience that should be had at least once in a lifetime; it may be one of the most beneficial experiences one can have in one's life.

In today's world, there are plenty of schools which require students to take various classes. Some of them focus on improving their students' knowledge and abilities at science, others base their syllabus on art. I completely oppose that schools require younger students to learn music. I have two reasons to think so; first, students should have free will and second, music may not be their cup of tea for some of them. First and foremost, no education center can require students to study music since this step is absolutely contrary to students' right of choosing freely. They should opt for their classes on their own without any interference. Let's suppose that school authorities have an opportunity to select students' classes instead of their own selves. In this regard, how can we expect that these students will be free adults in the future? Next, according to statistics and based on past experiences, I can unhesitantly state that some students are really good at music, however, others are not. As an inborn instinct, a human cannot be adept at everything. He or she has some special abilities or interest in different areas. Seldom do we run into some super students, whose IQ is most probably astronomical and who can do everything wonderfully. However, setting aside these kinds of heroes, most of our young children can do something well or badly. In a nutshell, authorities at schools do not have a right to make music lessons compulsory for students . Students should take their own decision freely.

Some use music for fun, others may use it to heal their heart. You can use music every time in your life, no matter what you feel.

It has happened to all of us, forgetting to add salt to food one time or another. When we tasted the food, we felt like it had no taste, although we added all of the right ingredients, but it felt like the food did not have taste. If we think about it a little, we can consider that this situation is similar to life without music. It may be a small part in our lives, but it is an effective one. Many times in our lives we have felt sad, angry, or maybe a little depressed; most of us listened to music in these moments. Some of us did it because it helped them to relax, while others did it because it made them stronger and more focused. Music has this magic power that can make our psychological status better. I cannot find a better example from life than the one I mentioned. Music in life is like salt in food; if we forget to add it, we probably will feel like we do not taste it; whether it is life, or whether it is food.

Hello Chris, How are you? I hope you are fine. We did not see each other for a long time. So, I would like to ask if you would like to go to the science museum next Saturday with me. It is in the vicinity of my home, so I would say we can take the train to the museum. So, we need 15 minutes and we will then be there. I think the museum will be perfect because we are both interested in science and there will be so much different stuff about the topic of science. This will be a good day when we go to the museum together. The museum opens at 9 a.m. so I would say we can meet each other at 8.30 a.m., at mine, and then go together to the museum. Now, you will maybe ask if you need something, but you do not need anything. I have all that we need so you do not need to bring anything with you. So, this will be all. I hope you will write me back as soon as possible and I look forward to a good answer.

Our forceful and rhythmic emotions are expressed through music. It's the sound of our hushed voices. Music is similar to food, air, and other necessities. Without music, we wouldn't be able to create anything. Sometimes music makes us feel better, occasionally it makes us feel emotional, and sometimes it makes us act erratically. Life would be emotional, monotonous, and everyone would look alike. Everything looks the same, and every word sounds the same. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Nobody expected it to be rhythmic. Everything would be done on a regular basis. And it's the most uninteresting aspect of the situation. Everything would be the same: we'd be emotional, our conversations would be emotionless, and everything would be the same. People gradually discover sounds. After that, they learn to combine sounds to create music. Finally, music will be in our lives again. Eventually, we got music. Everything will be like now. Rhythmic sounds are always in our life.

The population of the entire planet is increasing rapidly and the people who live in the many rural areas become more and more affected. The residents of the cities are more interested in changing their standard of living and this situation has become a crucial problem for the medical system. Most medical doctors think of a successful career and want to reach their goal with people living in a good environment. So they decide to leave their birthplaces for urban places. In every country there are two kinds of human settlements: the cities and the villages. While the opportunities that a city offers rise quickly, the variety of educational and technological things that a village could give you decreases dramatically. Therefore one of the most determinative shift shifts in the life of a man who wants a great career would be to leave his old village for a new town. I believe that medicine gives us a chance of victory for our body and mental health. A medical doctor means more than a simple human. Doctors help the entire world with their passion and hopefulness and that could be a reason why they long for more opportunities in their doctors' careers. In fact, this situation could be a big problem for the people who choose to spend their life in a village because every man needs the best medical system and it could be realised with the most prepared and smart doctors. So this point would be solved with similar salaries and a digitized and high-performance medical system. Every country should create a favorable environment for every occupation.

Music is always with me in my daily life, such as when I wake up, eat lunch or dinner, and good sleep. So, I think that music is important for our daily life. Even if my mood is very low, the right pop music played cheering sound for me. Also, music makes us relax and is a cure for daily tiredness. When we work or study in the daytime, we are always forced to listen to uncomfortable sounds, mechanical noise, people's voices, etc. But listening to music can cure our tired heart and take away our stress too. For example, when we eat lunch while listening to classical music, we feel very relaxed and have a feeling of happiness. For these reasons, I recommend that we listen to music in our daily life. Also, we sing a song with our favorite song. It is a very popular and cheap stress release, as Karaoke that can communicate with other people. I think that music must be in our life.

Today, music is omnipresent. Never was it easier to tune into your favourite song, whether you are working, are playing it in the background while dining, or during your daily commute. However, this begs the question whether one can listen to too much music. We all know the first signs of hearing a song too often, the inner playback in our head. The more serious symptoms can be significant effects on our daily lives in the form of productivity loss or demotivation. To answer the question of whether we can listen too much, we may first reckon the query of function. For some, the main intent is getting into a mood or emphasizing current emotions. Others see in music an efficient memory-aid, reliving the past. However, these functions seem to lose efficiency and effect if one listens to the same song too often. Instead of being associated with that one specific memory it becomes the song playing in the background at all times. That is why I advocate a more active and memorable way of listening to music and songs which get passively picked up in our daily lives, for example in the gym, on the radio, or at a party.

Music is part of my life because music expresses the need of your body to move it. For me music spreads the happiness and joy to share something. Each time there is music people react, some come to you and others go away. You can use music to create your environment with your style and a category of people you would like to be surrounded by. Music must be different according to your mood, depending on your energy needs. Sometimes calm, sometimes very excited. Life needs energy each day, but this energy must be expressed differently. If you are excited about for example because you have received bad news, you would like to calm down and become relaxed. I think you would be interested in listening to classical music. The same will be true if you have very good news and you would like to have the mood of a winner. I think you would like to listen to rock! I can't imagine life without music because it would mean I would be dead!

Do we need music in our lives? The answer to that question is a simple yes. I do not know why, but everyone is used to listening to music. There are some moments in our lives where music is more important. Many people have a special kind of music for a particular moment or situation. It can vary from person to person. For someone, sad music can be necessary to deal with a difficult moment, for another person, it can be music that will make them shake their body and dance a lot, who knows?

I am pretty sure that life will not be the same without music, indeed it will be very boring. Can you imagine taking a trip without music or even when a couple break up a relationship? It will not work. So, to sum up, I think music is part of humanity . It has been keeping both men and women happy and it helps them to deal with their feelings.

Music is everywhere, everything has a frequency, so that means all we are a kind of strange music but the main purpose of answering the questions is to justify why music is important.

Music can transport us the music when I listen to, the music can transport us can make fell us and remind us of specific things from our past or a simple good memory. When I listen to music I feel very good, but I have to mention that it depends on the music that I listen to.

Music is simply the bridge between the natural world and the spiritual world, and that's the reason it is written in the Bible that God inhabits the praises. Music is one of the ways we get connected to God; that's why we feel so good listening to good songs. Yes, it seems strange or even pretentious, but there is a clear difference between good and bad and we can all see this. That's the reason Homer used an illustration to say that some mermaids were singing to lure Ulysses and his partners to their island aiming to hold them there, and the message behind this part of the tale is really important because it is telling us that the goal behind a song is its qualifier. That said, music is really important in thousands of ways and sometimes we remember good or bad things because of a song which brings us positive or negative remembrances. In conclusion: without music, life would be a mistake and this is maybe the only thing I agree on with Nietzsche.

Music and the sensations associated with experiencing it are deeply rooted in Western culture. How big is the impact these mysterious sounds have on us? Do we necessarily need them for our well-being? Presumably, all of us have experienced the healing power of music at least once in a lifetime. When you feel under the weather, depressed or really anxious, it could be tremendously curative. It has been scientifically proven that music can cause an immense improvement in our mood and, mixed with exercising, can help us avoid depression. For God only knows how long , music have been used to sanctify human life. Ancient people, just like the modern ones, used music for rituals to give an impression of divinity. It may seem quite foreign, although just think about what people experience during a concert of their favourite music band. It is kind of mystical, isn't it? Music has been part of human culture since the dawn of time. I think everybody would agree that it has a tremendous impact on our life and makes the pain associated with the awareness of our finitude a lot more bearable.

Music, in my opinion, is really significant in our lives. Because music can serve a variety of purposes, like making us laugh, altering our ideas for the better, healing humans' minds, bringing people together, and so on. The ability to cure human minds is crucial. There are numerous things that could happen in our lives, and we could have a difficult time at times. Even though we are going through a difficult period, we can go on if there is music. In our lives, the function of putting individuals together is also a crucial one. Singing a song or dancing to music with others is not only entertaining, but it also brings people together. People can enjoy singing a song even if they are unable to speak with one another. These are some of the reasons why I believe music is essential in our lives. Also, I believe that without music in your life, your enjoyment of life will be halved.

Nowadays, more and more rural areas are beginning to experience an incredibly disagreeable issue: the lack of medical doctors. This void is due to the fact that many doctors are convinced that the salaries working in remote rural areas are too low and not satisfying enough. Thus, most of them prefer to begin their career in large cities, where they have got the possibility of earning more. This choice is understandable. The process of becoming a doctor is anything but easy: you have to study hard and commit for a long time. Hence, it would not be fair for a doctor to receive a low income. Were I to be a doctor, I would not accept myself less than a $5000 salary. Therefore, the unique solution is the following: raising the wages of doctors in rural areas, too, taking them to the same level as those of doctors who work in cities. Moreover, doctors who choose a rural area as their definitive workplace should get some extra money for that, because the choice of living in a village to help people renouncing all the comforts of the city is rewardable. This was just my humble suggestion in order to solve a problem which is spreading fairly fast and which has to be urgently overcome

Music has always played an important role in our life, since our forebears' times. It has often inspired men and women, making them brave and able to face many different situations. For instance, armies in the past used music to encourage them against enemies during the war, and it has been an inspiration for the biggest leaders around the world. It is also very important when people need to relax and escape from normal life. There are a lot of melodies that are able to make us feel in different ways, like sad, happy, and scared. In my opinion, living a life without music would be totally different, leaving our lives with no emotions and feelings, and human beings would not be used to living in this manner. That is why we will never be able to remove it from our lives.

In my opinion, the office is crucial for an employee's mind and for the results of the company because the environment could influence the workers and the increases or decreases of the business, which depend directly on their productivity. I think that it is very important to have an open design office in which there are no walls separating the workers. The employees' energy, their focus and mainly the teamwork could be influenced by the office. First of all, the environment should offer workers strength, willingness and team spirit. An open design of an environment could influence people to establish collegial relations. Also the office would motivate the employees because they should be more competitive with their colleagues. Moreover, owing to the lack of walls which separate the employees they could create a happy workplace with their capacity to make friends or to become colleagues with closed relationships. On the other hand, enclosed workstations create stress, anxiety, nervousness and tiredness for employees because they spend all their time alone in their office and they fail to exchange stories, opinions or experiences with their colleagues. A bad point for this kind of environment could be the lack of motivation generated by the absence of time spent with the others. As a consequence, the employees will come to work without enthusiasm and they will not be productive. Their way of thinking and their capacity to work should be influenced by all of these. In conclusion, the positive trajectory of an employee could be influenced by an office. This space should transform a stressful and unpleasant experience at work into a motivating, lovely and friendly one.

In fact, you have many offers to travel any place. If you can imagine it, you can go there. However, summer seems the shortest season, because you enjoy it a lot.

Do we need music in our lives? This is the question. Are there times when music is important? I'm sure, for example, in the times of the cold war when music helped soldiers to fight their enemies. They didn't give up because of music. How does music make us feel? There are a variety of types of music, some of them make us happy, other ones make us sad. But definitely music plays a huge part in our feelings and emotions. What would life be without music? We can't say exactly, because people have always been making music. They were making operas even in ancient Greece! That's why life without music can't be as good as it is with it. That's why I'm pretty sure that we need music in our lives.

I think the answers will lead us to a discussion from a political view. I think if the government do a lot better in their job then no matter what area you work in, you will receive a lot of money. The problem is there are still areas that are not as civilized as the city. I think it is not just money that may affect the doctors but in the city you will have more fun than in the rural areas. For example, in the city you can find a place that can cure your tiredness, such as a movie theatre or gym. This kind of place may not be found in a rural area. Let's look at the education problem. In my country students who want to be a doctor need to work hard in their studies. As you know, in the city the education is better than in the rural areas. I think that is why we don't have many doctors in rural areas because we don't have people to go back to work in their home.

I think no walls separating employees from their coworkers is the most effective for work rather than enclosed stations. I think so because in the office we need to work together and if we separate from each other it will make employees think they need to work by themselves, not work together. And, I also think there will need to be more space than usual because if you provide more space, it will make employees think they have enough space to think that they not imprisoned in the office, which will make them work better. No walls separating will make employees work together and not need to walk to reach each other. I think both employees and employers need to work in the same room if there is a small business. No one in a company needs to have a room to separate themselves from each other. If you have a separate room it will make you think you are more important than the others, which will lead to bad for the business.

I think that music has been made an important role in my life. My reasoning is as follows. Music can make us feel better. There is a variety of music in the world and each one has different effects. For instance, if you listen to calm music while you are studying, you may concentrate on this and your grade will rise. If you listen to powerful music when you feel sad, you will probably retrieve your courage and become a braver person than before. Thus, music is significant in our life. If you remove music from our everyday lives, you will feel lonely and sad. Also, musicians and other people who are interested in music or instruments will lose their hobby and will feel bored every day. For these reasons, I consider that music is necessary for us and never be able to remove.

In my opinion this kind of requirement must be abolished from school. I think it is not important to have this to graduate from school. In my school this requirement doesn't prove anything. All students fake the proof and the school doesn't do anything about it. In my country schools do a lot of things that I think are not really important. This type of requirement is one of them. The school said it will make students know how to work but they don't say what the benefit of this requirement is. The education in my country is one of the worst in the world that is full of things that don't suit for studying. They study hard but not effectively and the school is full of garbage things. Actually, I don't think it will say anything if you do it or not. As you might know that in school there are many teachers that have the authority to approve volunteer work and each of them doesn't do it in the same way. For example, one teacher will approve this work but another might not. It leads to why volunteer work does exist in the first place.

This review describes Write and Improve, a new writing tool for learners of English. This tool provides short leveled writing tasks for language learners. Students get immediate feedback on their mistakes. Much of the feedback is basic vocabulary and grammar mistakes which is very useful. The second type of feedback is when students don’t answer the questions or follow the task instructions even if their English is accurate. Both types of feedback are useful to students before they consult the teacher. The biggest problem is that the cost is 2.50 pounds per student per month paid BY THE TEACHER. Sorry, but this just does not work in most educational contexts. At a university, the student must pay for their materials and the teacher has little or no budget. I signed up for one class for one semester with my research budget but that was a one-time thing, regular teachers including me are not going to use this service. They need to find a way for teachers to assign students to buy a semesteru2019s subscription. I remember English Central had a similar problem at first but they figured it out. I hope Cambridge can figure it out too. Overall, I would recommend using this site for pre-intermediate and intermediate students when you have full use of a computer lab or students have their own devices with good wi-fi connections. You should try the free version. At the moment I cannot recommend the paid version for teachers but I hope they make some small changes to make the paid version more useful.

Yes. There are so many moments when you need to hear music, for example, when you have a bad day. A way not to think about it is with music, or if you want to work out music is an excellent way to warm up your body and spirit. Well, depending on the kind of music that I listen to, it makes me feel one way or the other. I usually listen to music while I walk, but also I listen to it simply for pleasure or for going to sleep. Also, there are a lot people that like to play an instrument and it is their way of living. Life without music would be so boring and grey. Everything would be monotonous, and I think that people would be more lonesome and cold. I think that a human being needs music to live.

Good morning. I am writing to share my opinion about your latest proposal. I read in the newspaper about your new proposal on banning mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. First I would like to congratulate you for being so brave, you will be strongly criticised by those people who use their mobile phone excessively. I am writing to you to say that I totally agree with your proposal. I think we live in a time where socializing is difficult, people prefer to use their mobile phone rather than talk to other human beings. I sometimes went out with co-workers after work time. Most spent the whole night using their mobile phone, texting messages to other people instead of talking to a person not less than one meter from them. It is affecting our relationships in society. I am afraid the next generation will not be able to have a normal life because they will not have the same experience as we have today. Most of my happy memories are spending time with people that enjoyed spending their time with me. What worries me sometimes is how people are easily distracted using their mobile phone in public places. I saw a car accident because a pedestrian was distracted using his phone and crossed the street without looking at the traffic. This really scares me, when technology causes fatalities, I am glad to share my opinion with you. I hope your proposal can be accepted soon. Thank you very much for your attention mister town council.

I think all students should have to study music and all schools need to have music classes that have as many instruments as they can. I think learning to play a musical instrument will make students be able to find a way that they can enjoy themselves. The reason why they need to have as many musical instruments as they can is each student wants to play various type of instruments. Some students want to play guitar and some want to play violin. Schools need to provide many musical instruments to support all students. And why is learning a musical instrument important? It is because schools need to show the way of the future to students, show how they can earn a living. Being a musician is one of the ways student can earn a living. I think, not just music classes, all schools need to have classes just like repairing or building something. The important thing is schools need to have as many varied classes as they can.

The process of personal growth is often related to music, every guy is used to listening to lots of music, especially in times when they suffer because of the end of a relationship. These are some of the most important moments when young people listen to music, above all music with sad lyrics. Luckily, we listen to music also when we are in a state of excitement, and we want to escape from reality. Music can make us feel happy, but we can also have a feeling of melancholy memories when we think of a person we have lost or we miss something that we would love to do. Some people say they could not live without music, and they are always looking for musical novelties. I think they would rather die than give up to music. It is difficult to image the world without music, and I think life would be a lot more boring with no poetry and I am sure that there would be someone who would invent it. Music is something related to human nature.

I think moving away and living on their own is a better because I am the kind of person that wants to live by myself. I don't want to live with other people. Then I think moving away and living on my own is suitable for me, better than living with my parents. The important thing is in my country there are no universities that are near my town. Then whether I want or not I need to move away anyway. Some people might want to live with their family because it is cheaper than living on their own. I understand that and it is an important thing to consider when you need to move away. If you can't afford to live on your own, you need to stay and live with your parents but it is difficult in my country to live like this. As I said before, in my country there aren't enough universities in every corner and each university in my country has a different quality. Then, like it or not, if you live in the area that has no university to attend, you need to move away anyway.

Although some argue that which health and money would be valuable, in my opinion, health generates a significant portion of our lives and provides us with productive days. This essay will analyze the statement and give a logical conclusion. First of all, human beings can no longer live without being healthy. Once they start having physical issues, it will be the highest priority to undertake medical treatments. Most patients would never think that they should earn money as much as possible, if they were in a serious situation. Therefore, they should keep their better bodies and mental status. People can consider how to earn more money once their body conditions settle down. Additionally, they can create effective ways to make their life more immesurable due to the fact that they are healthy. Furthermore, having a productive life will make one's life enriched. For example, some might spend free time with their family and others might see the tremendous view from a mountain. without money and they can realize how critical living healthily is. In conclusion, although more would be an essential part of people's life, keeping a stable mental as well as physical balance produces a great deal of benefits. I believe that being healthy outweighs the importance of money.

Even more than two thousand years ago, when Plato was working on his masterpiece The Republic he knew that in his ideal state there would be music as one of the two basic subjects of the education of the youth, together with gymnastics. Music is something like a flashlight in your pocket. Even in the darkest times you can reach out for it and light up at least a little bit of your journey. I believe that I should be behaving depending on my rational brain and that I have to nurture my emotional brain all the time. However, music is about feelings. I have known since I was a little kid that music is not just about the feelings of the song but that you can express your own feelings as well by listening. It was Nietzsche who said that life without music would be a mistake and I can't disagree.

Do we need music in our lives? The simple answer to the question above is yes. I cannot imagine a life without music at all. Without music, life is meaningless and has no color. Music is essential for me on any occasion, for example, when I am driving my car from home to work and vice versa, or when I am studying or doing exam preparation. Music has been a need for humans for many centuries because music plays an essential role in people's life, it is medicine for the brokenhearted. Life without music would be boring. According to some scientific research, music brings peace and tranquility to people's minds. Music helps us to stay sane in our difficult times. Music brings positive emotional brainwaves to our minds, which help us to stay calm and relaxed. That is why in every spa center, you will hear music playing in the background because it can make you calm. I live my life with music. I cannot live without it.

I would like to tell you about autumn because it's my favorite season. For me, it's the most special season of the year - the leaves are falling down and it's getting colder. But I would like to tell you a bit more about it. First of all, it's good to know that autumn is also called “the golden season“. Why? It is really easy: in October, all leaves which are brown and gold are falling down from the trees. The second fact is that these days are the last days where the sun's shining with its whole power and the sun is golden too. That's why it is called the golden season. Why do I like autumn? Well, especially in October, as I said the sun is really nice and all the leaves are falling down. In my opinion, a second reason is that the temperature is really nice. It means that it is not too hot, like in summer, but it is not as cold as in winter. So for me, it is perfect!

Many people believe that books will be replaced by digital devices in schools and universities. In my opinion, widespread computerisation is a good change because it can provide enormous benefits. The first and foremost pro is that it can reduce the rate of tree logging and deforestation. As many forests have been knocked down for the production of paper, using a computer or phone will automatically reduce the usage of books and it can be the best solution for this global issue. As a consequence, it can totally have a good impact on the creation of a sustainable environment. The second advantage of using computers or tablets is that they are more compact and portable than books. If an individual possesses a good internet access on her computer, she can search for any information through the numerous educational websites and digital dictionaries. Therefore, it is not necessary to carry a lot of heavy books to university. Consequently, students can enjoy their university lives more by using convenient digital devices. In conclusion, replacing computers and tablets instead of paper-based materials in schools is a good transformation for a better lifestyle.

Life is not only a meaningless fight to survive, it needs more. It needs something to bring beauty and purpose and I personally believe that music plays an important role in this. Music is one of the most popular ways to express our emotions and thoughts regarding a lot of real-life matters. In fact music is so important for us that every single civilization in the world has its music, with its particularities and expression. Music makes us feel better about life, about ourselves, and even the reality. Sometimes, the best medicine that we could take is a good song that will improve our mood. In my opinion, life without music would be an error. I am not able to imagine a world where music is not present in daily life, helping with emotions and giving meaning to relationships.

I think music is something really special. Music has a long history: all people who lived before us made music. So in my opinion, music is one of the most important things in life. For example, when we are in a bad mood, music helps us to get happier. Another point is that music helps you to calm down when you are stressed. There are a lot of other reasons why music is good for us, but I think these are the most important facts. In our lives, we often listen to music. Scientists say that we listen to music about five hours a day. Speaking for myself, I would say that I listen to music about one or two hours a day. Why? Especially in films or adds, we're listening to music without realizing it. In my view, life without music would be really quiet and boring. That would makes us unhappy and depressed. In my view, music is one of the most important things in life.

I certainly think that doing some volunteer work is really good for society in general. Everyone should spend a part of their life of doing that. On the other hand, I do not think doing volunteer work is something I should receive graduation for. I think when you graduate it is important to focus on your knowledge or your work. Doing your own project or things like that are more important for graduates rather than being a volunteer. Being a volunteer is really good because you help people or a company and that is really generous work. However, you have to devote your time to it and when you study hard it is not that easy. Time is fundamental for studying and doing your work at school. As you have to do homework, write essays, learn to pass a test, study to get to another school, you do not have much time. And the year of graduating might be a bit stressful. In conclusion, I think that completing a certain amount of volunteer work should not be a requirement to graduate and that is because it takes your time to really focus on graduating itself.

People are divided on the purpose of information resources. Some people think books should be replaced by electronic devices such as notepads and gadgets, while others consider them as valuable items that convey the culture that was present at the time of publication. In my opinion, the existence of books will be preserved from now on. It is obvious that technology plays a significant role in our life. With the advancement of technology, it has become easier and faster to connect people and their culture and communicate in business. In other words, it wouldn't be possible for human beings to live a day without technology. On the other hand, there has been a great variety of things even though they are no longer latest. One of those representatives can be books. Not to mention books provide immeasurable benefits for the young generation to the elderly. For example, some people would remember that their parents read a different variety of books when they were little or younger. It can be said that reading various kinds of books can lead to raising not only the imagination but also communication skills. Therefore, thousands of works have been published all over the world. In conclusion, although the power of technology is indubitable, books produce a great deal of merits for our community. I strongly believe that books play a significant role in this modern society.

Music appeared a very long time ago. Music is important in our life, it can make us be less stressed and make us feel happy. It makes our life better. There are lots of kinds of music: rock, jazz, blues... Each kind of music gives you one different feeling. Rock and jazz make you feel excited. Blues music makes you feel comfortable. Country and folk mix exciting and light music together. People listen to music when they need to relax. Life will be boring without music. Without music, there's no high point or low point in our life. A big part of relaxing activities will have disappeared! You won't have many things to do. I listen to music every day, so music has become my friend. Without music life will become smooth, boring, and not interesting.

Music has become a friend of all of us, and you can also become a musician!

A long calm life or a short intense one. I think that living a life that is worthy is the principal goal of any human being. So, I would prefer a short intense life that is worthy instead of a long nonsensical life. The principal reason is that I want to travel to a lot of different places and know the culture and life there. I also want to learn as much as I can and create precious moments during my lifetime and if these reasons mean living a short but intense life, I prefer creating memories and living the day every day. I have always wanted to know different parts of the world because I am really interested in cultures and customs from different parts of the world and how behaviours or ways of living from one city to another or one country to another change is fascinating for me. Thus, I would love to live travelling and living experiences in my life. Another reason why I prefer an intense short life is because I like to learn and know a lot. So, I would like to learn as much as I can in different fields of science or life. I do not mean how long I can learn, I just want to learn and try to comprehend the world around us. I would definitively prefer to live a worthy life than a long life. I want to live a life that can be an inspiration for everybody or at least for people around me.

University life is different when you live alone or you live with your family. Both cases have pros and cons, but, to me, the best option is living with family. In my experience university could be stressful and most of the time you don't have enough time to do many activities so if you live with your family, it facilitates a lot of things such as you don't have to pay attention to expensive bills or making food. that, when you live with your family you have more time to focus on your studies and you don't have to pay much attention to other things. When you live with someone who cares about you, university life is easier to deal with. In conclusion, if you have the opportunity to choose between going or staying with your parents during your university degree, you definitely should choose the second option because your university life will become easier.

As members of a society we sometimes are asked to step up and help other people or the community around us. In some institutions, like our high schools, it's done through mandated volunteer work. Is it right? Must students be obliged to do volunteer work in order to graduate? Can the words obliged, mandated and volunteer be written in the same sentence? In our everyday lives we are surrounded by the problems our society faces, when we turn on our TVs or connect to the internet we see a lot of people struggling to have something to eat, places devastated by storms and flooding, the famine in Africa, etc. Being aware of all that is happening, it's obvious that something must be done, so it's our responsibility to give support for those in need and sometimes the best way to do it is through volunteer work. We have to find ways to encourage volunteer work and our educational system has the places where we can nurture our individuals to care for the problems of our society. Since kindergarten our children must be aware of its complexity, respecting their ages and understanding capability of course, in order to be ready to take action when it's needed. As previously stated, of course we need citizens willing to help our society, but this involvement must be achieved with education and not obligation. The obligation is in the hands of our institutions that can encourage students using win-win solutions that connect those in need with those with the resources and responsibility to help.

If you want to make something interesting, you will need to listen to music. I can imagine a life without cars, but a life without music is very difficult to understand.

Everybody has listened to or played some music at least once in their lifetime; there are so many people who have had the opportunity to enjoy a concert or sing a composition on a stage and of a stage and from all of this it is amazing how people can connect through music and can share different emotions through different melodies. Furthermore, it is well-known that music can stimulate our mind and can nurture our soul; after all there's always a song for every occasion, such as when we are feeling under the weather or having a really difficult time, there are some songs which either make us feel a little bit more relaxed, or can raise our mood and motivate us to keep going. It is important to remark that music allows us to feel all emotions that we experience in our lives. Apart from that, we are able to connect our mind and physical coordination when we dance to the rhythm of the music. At the same time, we can feel relaxed and happy due to the fact that we liberate oxytocin and dopamine which are often called happiness hormones, as a result of those we can get benefits for our physical and mental health. Besides, music is vital to make memories with those who we love and care for; we hold bonds through music and every time we listen to that melody we can remember a special moment, such as a birthday, a date, a wedding, a dance, or just a loved person's smile. On the other hand, a long time ago Nietzsche said, "Without music, life would be a mistake," and I completely agree with him. If we didn't have music we would miss a way to express our feelings, we wouldn't be able to fully enjoy a great moment, or we wouldn't be able to put our sorrow in words and notes. Finally, I consider that music not only enriches our lives and minds, but also allows us to create memorable moments and convey our overflowing emotions.

Music was invented a long time ago, and music has played a really important role in our lives from time immemorial. Nowadays, music is important in our lives, you can see music is everywhere, in the supermarket, in the coffee shop, and on the street that you go to school or go to work on. On the farms in Japan, you can see the cows are also allowed to listen to music because they believe when cows listen to music the cows become more relaxed and they will grow adequately. Those are some examples of music in our lives. You can see somehow music has become a part of our lives. Music can also help us feel more relaxed and comfortable, which is why music is very popular, and there are some studies that prove music can impact children in a good way and help improve their brain effectively. Music can also help adults and old people improve their mental and physical health, help them to be able to go through hard times and gain more force. In my opinion, without music, our life is boring and stressed because music is a part of our life.

Today's world, studying at university becomes more and more significant for the young generation and it seems to be a most efficient way to learn about life. To my way of thinking, studying abroad is much more preferable in as much as that it contributes to younger people to be wise adults in three ways as follows. The first and foremost reasons for my choice is that many students do not have a chance to learn how to manage money. For instance, they do not get used to pay bills for electricity or distribute money to other necessary items. However, a university student has to pay attention to make compulsory payments, otherwise he or she has to burn the midnight oil in real terms. Another reason which absolutely deserves some words here is that staying at home during university years means beating a dead horse. I mean, studying at university teaches young brains something about life not only for landing jobs but also becoming a social, conscious person. Additionally, it paves the way for taking these opportunities and for having fun to take decisions without any interference of parents. On the other hand, sitting next to lovely dad and mom provides the same lifestyle as being a student at high school. Lastly, it will be worthwhile to study away from sweet home since it accustoms both children and parents to live separately. For parents, this milestone causes them to be able to travel without any responsibility. For students, they can find good jobs in other big cities while interning in big companies. In a nutshell, it is the time to live freely and take their own decisions even though they might be wrong. With the aim of learning life easily, students should study abroad. Otherwise they will miss the boat.

Dear Head or Member of town council, About your policy to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, I think it is not wise to make this legal. I don't know why you are thinking of banning the use of mobile phones because I don't see the reason in the letter you gave me. If you write the reason on it, I still think it is still not good to ban it. It against our right to use it. I think if we don't use a mobile in an illegal way, I can use it wherever I want and you have no right to ban it. I encourage you to reconsider your policy or if you need to show us why this thing came to your mind, you need to tell us more about what the problem is that you have with using mobile on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In my opinion, I think you need to provide wifi for free in public, not banning us to use our phone. I am still waiting for your aspect of you and I think your think you aspect will need to be worth me considering your point about your policy. If you don't have more information to give to us, I will consider your policy is against our right and I think you need to reconsider your dictatorial policy. If you do not reconsider, I think we can't accept your new policy and I will do whatever it causes to stop you making this public.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that music lessons are taken in a very relaxing way in Spanish schools, since most young people actually cannot read a music sheet or play an instrument. Consequently, not many people work in the music field, and those studies get to the luckiest people. On the one hand, learning music is a productive activity for spending time, in contrast to playing video games or watching TV, since the learner acquires an ability to concentrate. Furthermore, he could get a musician titulation, besides you won't need a university degree to get a job. Moreover, creativity develops faster, which is an essential part for future jobs. Think of Mozart, he started to play piano at the age of five, and when he went to his first concert, he had composed his first song beforehand. On the other hand, music studies require a lot of time and not everyone is patient. Also, music needs constancy to go on with it, so students must love the area. Another crucial point is money, which is necessary to access studies. Most current singers and musicians have learned music in a very intensive way, and that is what has led them to follow their dreams. To summarise, I think music is important anyway, even if you don't understand musical notes, because it plays a huge role in our life.

It is an important subject and it is also controversial because a lot of people have different ideas about it, but in my opinion I believe that money is very important in our life. I am not saying that it is the most important, but to have money makes your life easier because you can have many things that you can't have otherwise and it also involves things that you need for your health. For example, if you have a serious disease and for that disease you need to buy very expensive medicine and you have no money to buy that, then you are going to die because you cannot afford it. I think that every person must have the necessary things, but there are other people that criticise you when you have aspirations to have more money. They say that you are greedy because you want to have more money. I know that money is not everything in life, but money can solve many things in your life that are very important for your health. Both things are important because you need health to make money, but you also need money to have good health.

English is very important for everybody because it is the way that you have to interact with other people, and if you have a job where you have to travel and be in other countries, then you are going to need to communicate with others. I am a software engineer and it is very important because all programming languages are made in English and I need to read a lot of English. Personally, I need to learn English because I want to go and live in another country. When you speak English or another language you realize how many opportunities come to your life because you are going to have the facility to communicate with anyone without restrictions and many companies are looking for that. They are looking for people who can communicate with others and are able to work without gap. When you hear a person speak in another language it is very strange, but at the same time it is very impressive because those people have studied a lot to get that new language that not many people are willing to learn. But this kind of thing is a reason for you to feel motivated, and you also start to learn a new language.

More and more learners have involved themselves in acquiring various types of language skills these days, compared to the past. Some argue that studying a foreign language is simply a waste of time. However, in my opinion, learning new things such as a language generates an essential part of a person's life, learning new things such as language generates an essential part of the person's life. To commence with, not to mention learners can have an easy way to contact diverse cultures as well as people from all walks of life. If they are familiar with the local language, they can try to understand things, such as manners, rituals, etiquette, and so on. Following on from this, to give an example, tourists who already have knowledge of the local language and destination in advance can make the trip more enriching. Additionally, one's career chances would be broadened. It is likely that people who have a particular knowledge of languages can make effective use of it. For instance, they would be surprised a number of things that they can expect even if they go on a business trip to another area that they are not willing to go. That can lead to gaining life experience and they could accomplish it without the skills. What is more, learners can spend a productive life. Largely, learning a language will never end and make learners give up easily. On the other hand, once they keep challenging the task that would not be necessary, they can be more confident in themselves. To establish a time schedule to study, they can be more self-disciplined. In conclusion, although there would be no point in learning an international language for some people, I am convinced that the way provides us with valuable chances to make one's life more effective. Therefore, it would be advantageous to learn a language.

Dear Sir/ Madam, I am writing this letter to you because I wanted to express my opinion on the new decision you will be trying to implement and with it I hope to change your settlement of banning the use of mobile phones in some public places. As we all know, our phones have become a part of our everyday life, an object most people cannot live without. I am not judging because I also find myself in that category. I certainly understand why the town council has decided to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport, in shops and in restaurants, but I also consider that it is a bit of an exaggerated decision. I opt to believe that the main reason why we use our phones so much is because we try to make the best out of our precious time, and our phones can be of great help for reaching out to our close ones who may live away from us, so the only time we really get to talk to them is while on a bus or when buying groceries. Furthermore, I strongly agree with banning the utilization of our phones in restaurants due to the fact it might be a great change and people will have no choice but to socialize rather than using their phones for more than half the time they spend at the restaurant waiting for an incredibly short dopamine rush from a notification they just received. Thank you for your attention and I hope you will take my letter into consideration. Yours faithfully, Florin

In my opinion, it is important to tell the truth. I don't think it is acceptable to tell a lie. Of course, it may hurt my feelings if someone tells me the truth but I always prefer them to tell me the hurtful truth rather than a cheerful lie. When I have a reflection from anyone, when it is the truth, I think if I know them, then I fix what I have done wrong. It will benefit me more than just pretending I haven't done something wrong or lying to me. If you do that I don't know what I'm doing wrong. If I don't, then it impossible for me to correct it later. This situation will make something worse the next time. That is why I think it will be good if you just tell me the truth. I have watched a movie recently about a family that didn't tell the truth about one of its member's illness. They gave the reason as to not to harm her with the truth. I think it is a kind of culture in Asian families to hide the truth. I don't think it works for me, as I said. I really need them to say what illness I have because it is my life. I think it is bad for this culture that interferes with my life using an excuse such as it is for your own good. Why is it good if I don't know that I was wrong?

Hi Billal, what's up?! Last week, we had a school trip. We went to the Iztaccihuatl volcano park, it's a really cool mountain to have a holiday. There is a zone with cabs, another place to have picnics, you can climb the peak if you want, and there is a lot of snow everywhere! We rented a picnic area and did some group activities before having lunch, after that we climbed until the middle of the mountain, and we took a lot of photos from that place. Finally, we had a talk about the importance of the parks. I really enjoyed hiking in the place, it was a challenging activity. Not all of my teammates reached the goal, but it was fun working in teams to climb the peak. Bye!

Many students and their parents get in a dilemma when it comes to allowing their child to study while he's away or making him stay back home and continue his higher studies from a local university. In my opinion, students must stay with their parents and pursue their education from their home university as it guarantees a safe and secure environment for them to study, while also allowing students to be financially independent thus helping them to concentrate on their studies. It is a known fact that parents love and care for their children and ensure no harm comes their way. This parenting ensures a safe and secure environment in which the student can focus on his studies. For instance, a close friend of mine went to Canada for his higher studies. Soon after reaching there, he started to have difficulty adjusting to the new environment and also started feeling homesick. Hence, he had to quit his studies midway and return home to his parents. Due to this complex of feeling insecure in a new and an unknown environment, some students find it difficult to stay away from home, for extended periods. On the other hand, students who live alone, away from their parents, and study, often have to worry about their extra expenses as they have to pay for the accommodation, food, study material etc. They are compelled to work in a part-time job. This is not the case with those students who stay home with their parents and are able to focus on their education. For example, almost 90% of Cambridge University students living in college hostels complained of not getting sufficient time to complete their assignments and tutorials, which has negatively affected their grades. As a result, students who stay home are able to devote more time towards their coursework, since they do not have to work part time to pay for any the above expenditures. In conclusion, in my opinion, students are far better off staying with their parents while they are studying. This way a student can better focus on his lectures and get good grades as his parents are close by to take care of him and he does not need to worry about paying for any extra expenditure.

Music I like listening to music very much, every day, when I have a bath, have breakfast, do sport... The music makes me feel better. There are different kinds of music and there are people who like only one or two kinds of music, but there are other people who like all kinds of music. When you listen to music, you feel different senses. There is music which makes you feel happy, sad, melancholy, or makes you move your legs. There are moments in our life, like when we celebrate things at parties, we look for a kind of music for this moment because the music helps us at that time. Music is a natural thing in our life, there is music when birds sing, when you walk into a forest, you listen to a river, the wind, etc... Music is life and must go on. I hope you agree with me.

If I was asked about the life expectancy, preferring having a 100-year and calm life or having a shorter lifespan but much more fatigue, frankly, I would rather take the first one, having a long life and living as cool as a cucumber as there are two main reasons corresponding to family and individuals. To begin with the first reason, I am convinced that the ultimate journey of each person is to build a beautiful family. Furthermore, spending more time taking deliberately care of our children as human beings is also considered as a magnificent habit of a human being, thus, the more time we have, the more care we give to our children and the more joyfulness we gain in return. Additionally, if I am blessed to live until that age, I will hold my spouse's hand, take a stroll in our garden, evoke our good old days and thank her for her sacrifices for our family. Moreover, I can imagine the distinction between living a long calm life and a short intensive one. From my perspective, I presume this is about the grief when passing away too soon to see our children grow up, or even worse, witness our beloved ones struggling alone for the family livelihood. If I were in this circumstance, I would not forgive myself because of my impulsive incidence. Importantly, I prefer a long lifespan coinciding with being patient as this is my temperament, influencing others on seeking a meaningful life and, literally, encouraging society to be better.

In modern society, the passive lifestyle has reached its peak popularity. There are various reasons for that. As a result, many believe that mandatory exercises three times a week must be introduced in educational establishments, including both schools and universities. And while I do agree that people should be more physically active, I am opposed to the idea of doing it forcibly. To begin, it is obvious that most children and young people prefer to watch TV or play a video game in their spare time, rather than spending it outside playing with peers or merely taking a walk. The consequences of such decisions include obesity and related illnesses. Thus, physical activity is needed in order to reduce health problems and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, according to various studies, exercising multiple times a week decreases the chance of developing diseases like diabetes, blood pressure as well as cardiovascular conditions. In addition, being active is said to improve psychological health and reduce stress and depression. It is also believed that playing sports helps to relax mentally, therefore, increasing study performance. However, I strongly disagree that exercising must be obligatory due to the following reasons. First and foremost, making anything compulsory decreases pupils’ and students’ interest in participating in it. As it is accepted that young people see such actions as a limitation of their free will. Hence, their motivation plunges. Secondly, during the PE lessons, teachers compare studentsu2019 accomplishments to each other, rather than comparing their results individually. it for others who may have a good background in physical training can adversely affect an individual's self-confidence and lead to mental disorders such as stress, depression and physical discomfort. In the final analysis, I believe that being physically active is essential in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Although I do not agree that PE lessons must be compulsory. From my perspective, exercising and playing sports give better results when individuals themselves show interest in participating.

The majority of people have a belief that we should always tell the truth in our society. In my opinion, we can skip telling the truth to others to have good communication with them. Unfortunately, there are both pros and cons of both statements. In this essay, I will illustrate with relevant examples to elaborate further. To be honest, it is not easy to tell the facts all the time in society. While speaking genuinely, you may face struggles in the initial phases but, in the future you will have a better relationship with each of us. In addition, you never feel any guilt inside when you are honest. Furthermore, people will also appreciate your loyalty. For example, we have to be truthful to all our friends and family, which builds trust in their heart because you are with them their whole life. It hurts, but we stay true to them. However, telling the truth is going to be risky at some times. Certainly, we have to lie to escape from critical situations. Moreover, to make others happy you will tell a lie in certain situations. For instance, the office is not the safest environment to tell facts all the time. It builds a negative impression with staff, which affects your work badly. At certain times, you have to skip to make a healthy and prosper interaction with all your colleagues. In conclusion, we have to tell the truth to our friends, relatives and other applicants. At the same time, you can lie to strangers. At the end of the day, you have to maintain good and healthy relationships with each and everyone.

I believe that young people shouldn't be forced to do sports activities although it's healthy and necessary for them . These days especially young people are not doing sports activities anymore because now the lifestyle is becoming more and more sedentary . Our lifestyle has changed a lot in the last few decades . Young people are not interested anymore in sports . They'd rather use their devices such as mobile phones and computers than go outside and play football or basketball. Teens need to play sports because they are developing and this would help them develop more healthily . It has been shown that teens who do sports at least 3 times a week develop more healthily and happily . These people are very important because now teens start developing their muscles and doing sports is going to help them to become more muscular . Sports could help children develop their social skills and be able to make friends . Socialising is necessary for the mental health of children. These days children have forgotten how to socialise because the electronic devices keep their attention and time . Indeed, the times have changed but children mustn't forget about sports and socialising. Indeed, it's very important for young people to do sports but they shouldn't be forced because they are going to lose their interest in sports . Instead children should be encouraged to do sports activities, like advertising more in schools, organising more activities such as football championships , basketball matches or running competitions with prizes. If we take these measures we will be able to increase the interest in sports among young people. They would love to do sports if they found it interesting and engaging. They are the new generation , aren't they ? If we did something the situation wouldn't be like this. We should do something, shouldn't we ?

The start of a school year is always fun. You reunite with your friends, which you have not seen in a while. You meet your new teachers as well, and most importantly, you write your goals down for the new year. In school we have several subjects. Some of them I am good at. While others need some improvement. Let us take a look at them, and find out my plan for the next year. I love languages, whatever the language is. Learning languages is always fun and superb, because it gives us the chance to communicate with other people in other parts of the world. But, of course, there are some subjects that I do not like that much, in short, they are chemistry and physics. It is not that I do not like the practical aspect of them, because it is very interesting. Their theoretical aspect is boring. I think that this aspect needs a lot of work this year.

It is crucial to go on a vacation once in a while, because it helps us release the tension that we all suffer from in our lives. Some of these vacations are remarkable, maybe because of the place that we went to, or maybe because we were so tense back then, and the vacation was necessary for us. Today, I am writing about one of these delightful vacations. Two years ago, I went to Spain at Christmas. This holiday was the best one I ever had. I went to Valencia, it is a beautiful city on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. The most amazing thing about Valencia is the mixture between the past and the present. We saw monuments that belong to the period of Muslim rule. I also went to the Mestalla stadium, which belongs to my favorite football club, Valencia. This was the highlight of my vacation.

Health is the most important thing in our lives. If our health is poor then we will not be able to enjoy life anymore. We have all seen wealthy people who suffered from untreatable diseases and died. The paradox is that their money couldn't help them. Exercise is a huge part of healthy living. It is crucial to do sports on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis. Sport is vital for our bodies in so many ways. But, is exercise the only thing that we should do? The answer is: absolutely not. Sport is essential, but it is not enough. Cutting harmful habits might be more important than exercise. Eating healthy food is critical as well. The worst unhealthy habit ever is smoking. The problem is that it does not just affect the people who smoke. It also affects their surroundings. It is proven that smoking kills millions of people every year, so we have to cut it out of our lives. It is necessary to eat healthy food in order to keep our bodies and minds healthy. This includes fruits, vegetables, and grains. Eating healthy food also means that we should not consume junk food daily.

Learning to play instruments can be a wise way to spend your time - it improves memory and exercises your brain to focus better. Studying music, combined with testing your abilities to play, has quite a few positive outcomes. To start with, the majority of students like to complain about lack of enthusiasm and action in schools, as well as no place to expand your creativity. What could be a better place than a music class? The music itself has the power to form new passions or even relationships. Studies have shown listening and playing have an amazingly surprising impact on one's brain. In a music class, when you meet new people and share your interest, you can not only make new friends but also develop a better understanding of how sound works. It can be useful for physics students! Moreover, having a music class in between other lessons can help you to feel more focused after. After all, music classes should be about discovering new genres, artists, and instruments, which not only develops the brain but is also relaxing. With a more stable and quiet state of mind, students are proven to perform in other classes much better. Thirdly, learning to play new instruments can cause one to uncover new passions, which, in the future, can result in finding a new job or just impressing potential partners with one's abilities. All in all, I think music classes are a perfect opportunity to try something new and come upon people sharing similar interests. Nonetheless, I understand how some of the students are against it, arguing they already don't have enough time for basic classes. My opinion is that the classes should be extracurricular, in order to actually gather people who want to learn new skills.

Unlike travelling in the past, it is easy to travel today in our modern world. There are many kinds of vehicles, cars, airplanes, ships, and trains.

When talking about vehicles, these two things are the most important . Safety is first, and speed is second. I also think that the shapes of the vehicles will be different too. The purpose of these changes will be to make them more comfortable and safer. I tend to believe that the roads will be different as well. I could not imagine the changes that are going to happen to the roads, but I do not think they will be the same.

Music could represent many things, depending upon who is listening to it. To a lot of people, music represents a way of expressing ideas, feelings, and culture. To others, it is a way of entertainment, or could even represent a career. Also, music can be a way of life, and it involves many other jobs and activities behind it that are complemented with music. So yes, music is definitely important. It makes us feel energized, relaxed, excited, even sad sometimes. As history shows, music is related to some of the most important events, such as protests, war, or a way of intimidating your enemies. Music is one of the most effective ways of communicating, and without it, probably the whole world would behave and express itself very differently. In conclusion, if you think about memorable moments that you have had in your life, in probably a few of them music was a part of it.

Considering the unhealthy lifestyle of students and the importance of exercise, I agree with the idea that students are forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Firstly, many students these days do not do sports activities actively, while a few decades ago, it was ordinary for students to spend their free time doing sports, as there were not many other options. However, with the emergence of technology, many young people started to play games and be on social media rather than moving their body to do sports. This change in the attitude of the youth towards sports is certainly not desirable as doing sports while young is extremely important to stay healthy and live longer. Young ages are biologically most suitable for making their body strong as it is the time when body cells most proliferate. When people reach a certain age, making numerous cells is no longer possible and thus they start to decline. Therefore it is critical for people to build a strong body while young so that they can retain the good condition for longer. Considering how students are doing sports activities less and less, forcing them to participate in sports would be a great measure for the sake of students. Another point is that doing sports would be a good opportunity for students to build a strong bond with each other. Many sports require people to team up and compete with the other teams. This characteristic makes students learn about the importance of cooperation because otherwise they would not be able to win the game. In addition, since team members have to be cooperative, even the team members were strangers to each other, they would eventually be able to be friends. Moreover, doing sports could affect other aspects of students' life positively. It is known that by doing exercise, people feel refreshed and they can focus on study more than when they are not. Thus, overall improvement, including their physical and mental condition, could be well estimated.

I believe that speaking English has always been important because it is the way that you have to communicate with other people. Speaking English is as important as it was in the past and I believe that it will never change. The difference between now and in the past is that before it was more difficult because you didn't have all the tools that you have now, and you had to find the way you had to learn English. Before you didn't have all the applications that you have now. For example, you have several tools that can help you to study the structure and grammatical tenses in English and you also have another application that helps you to communicate with other people and that can help you to practise your pronunciation. Today, you can search for web pages on the internet where they help you to practise your listening with podcasts. You have a lot of content in English that they helps you with the whole process that you need for learning English. But there are many people that do not want to learn English because they think that all the tools that we have now are enough to communicate, and it is not true at all because all these tools can help you in a specific moment but not in all cases.

Hi brother, I'm writing to you about my favorite film. This is Cast Away with the actor Tom Hanks. I like this movie because it is very similar to my experience. Love vanishes, the truth disappears, but life goes on and carries on with new meanings. Apparently, it is a romantic movie, but it isn't, I'm sure you will like it.

For me, music is the important thing in our life. I don't know what's going on without music some days. Music was created for everyone, for every single age, and music is well known everywhere on earth. People listen to music when they feel sad, happy, or when they are studying, or when they need motivation... there are many kinds of music nowadays. I usually listen to music about 3 - 4 times in my typical day. First, when I wake up to focus my mind after a long night. In my opinion, chill music is the best music for these moments, its slow melody is going to help you with more focus. The second time when I commute. I just want to listen to cancel out the noise in the street that could make you stressed. The third time when it is my workout, music gives motivation to complete all of my tasks. And the last one, before I go to sleep, a little ballad music makes me feel better after a long day. In conclusion, music is an important thing in life.

Hi Andy, How are you? I went to a music concert last week. It was the concert of my daughter's piano school. I was a camerawoman for the concert, so I had to go there early morning. The instructor's performance was great, and the kids were so cute. My daughter played well, but she fell after the performance. I was surprised, but she didn't cry, so I gave her a great cheer. If you want to listen to the concert, I will give you a DVD. I recommend that the playing of senior students were so good. Please let me know how you feel about it. See you next week. Kuroneko

Considering the globalization of the world, learning to speak a foreign language is more important than ever before. Firstly, most international businesses are run in a global language, namely English. With the help of technology and transportation, the market has now expanded from a nation to the world, and companies are making deals with not only those from the same countries, but also with the ones from abroad, which is possible only if they can communicate by using the same language. Thus to succeed in business, people need to learn foreign languages. Another point is that more cooperation with other nations is needed to solve global issues. Currently, the world is confronted with global warming, overpopulation, and numerous other problems. These are grave enough to threaten the whole planet and all living creatures. To deal with such immense issues, nations should have constructive conversations which can be possible with a smooth understanding available through a common language. Given that immediate actions for the planet are necessary, the necessity of learning a new language to discuss the solution is higher than in the past. Overall, the importance of learning a foreign language is higher than in the past.

Medicine is a noble specialization, it needs a decent, kind, and nice person to work within it, but doctors are also humans like all of us, and they need to earn money. In order to implement that, they work in cities, leaving the rural areas with a limited number of doctors, causing a problem. What is the solution? Before we dig into the solution, we should understand the reasons. It is obvious that cities are more profitable for doctors, and we cannot blame them for their desire to earn money. Yes, medicine is a humanitarian job, but that does not mean that they should earn less money than everyone else. If we thought about it, we can see that it is not just about the doctors. Rural areas are less profitable for most of the other jobs, because there are fewer people there, which means less demand for everything. Now, what is the solution? Actually, solving the doctors' problem in rural areas is part of the whole rural area problem. Legislation should be made by governments to encourage doctors to move to rural areas. They also should give them monthly incentives as a reward for their effort in solving this problem. We cannot blame doctors on this issue. It is the government's duty to solve these kinds of problems.

Although many people say that it is very bad for the health of children to play video games for a long time, for me, even if excess is never good, today video games are a big part of the culture and the life of people Video games will prepare the professional life of children. Rather than being without activity , this is a better way to learn how to manage a digital environment. There are many applications in their professional life, like how to operate a crane, or an excavator, or a fighter jet. Before now, when children read a lot, nobody was worried about this situation. Reading a book can be compared to this activity of video games. There is just one limit for the mental health of children when they do too much of something. Life needs to be balanced with other activities like outdoor activities like jogging or football. For me, you must encourage children to be the best in video games.

The shape and design of our work spaces are critical, and it is proven that these two things affect our productivity and psychological state during work. Some offices contain cubicles, which are enclosed workstations, while others contain open work spaces. So the question needs to be asked is, which one of them is better? I believe that the worst design for an office ever is the one including cubicles. Cubicles will make the employees feel like they are in jail, and their cubicles are their own cells. When the employee feels this way, you cannot expect him to do superb work. In order to make the employee more productive, you should make him feel like he still has some of his freedom, even though he has to work seven or eight hours per day. I think it is obvious that I do not prefer enclosed workstations. Instead, I love open ones, because it is going to give the employee a better feeling about his job, rather than him thinking about it like jail. So within the design of our offices we should send a message to our employees that this place is theirs, this feeling could help them be more productive and invested in their jobs.

People have different positions about animals in zoos. For me it is a difficult choice between the well-being of animals and the need for people to know animals better. All people can be against the freedom of animals and you must find a balance to give animals a good quality of life when they are in a zoo. Could you imagine a zoo with a big area where animals can be like in a wild forest? I think the whole discussion about zoos and the freedom of animals becomes less important if the zoo has adapted the conditions to keep the animals happy to live in this place. This condition will be the only solution to allow us to reconcile the animals' life and the need for people to discover these different animals in the vicinity of their home. I propose that all the zoos be adapted to each animal they want to keep.

I believe that there are activities a person should do at least once in his life. Public speaking, painting a wall, conquering a fear, and volunteering. Why volunteering? I read about some high schools which require the student to complete a certain amount of volunteering time in order to graduate. I really respect and love this idea, and I think I am going to send these schools a letter thanking them for this superb gesture. Volunteering is the best activity the person can do when he is young. It helps them appreciate the value of time. Today, most young people are spending an enormous portion of their time on social media, which is a total waste of time. When they volunteer, they will understand that their time could be spent on more beneficial activities. Volunteering can change their thoughts about several subjects as well. This happened to me, volunteering helped me see the world in a more gracious way. A complaint most arise arises from some students who do not want to volunteer, what they did not think about is that going to a school is a privilege, because not everyone can afford it, so they are lucky enough to be at school and I assume that if they thought about it for a while they would not reject it anymore.

Offices vary from each other mostly with designs and atmosphere surrounding the place. Do these two have any connection? Apparently, yes! People are herd animals - their work is more effective in groups or pairs. Open spaces in the office have many benefits, one of them being people learning to be more cooperative and trustworthy. Coworkers can get to know each other better, which will benefit in the future. While working on important projects, workers have to join forces and brainstorm together. Without the previous socialization with one another, the work wouldn't be effective. No walls in the office is a fantastic idea from a psychological point of view, too. Workers do not feel confined by the small, almost claustrophobic cubicles. It leads to a betterment of mental health and overall well-being of the employees. Interacting with others - from consulting and analyzing to telling jokes and spending time together - results only in positive effects. Happy employees equal quality work - that is why it is important to remember about the company's building design.

Many people like to study near their home to see their family every evening, but me, I prefer living abroad to discover new people and areas. The second choice is difficult because you need to change your habits. That is also the goal of studying, to have the occasion to do different new things and encounter new situations. I'm definitely going to study abroad because you learn through immersion. That's not something abstract, but very practical and concrete. This way of studying is better for memorizing situations and languages. You also have more occasions to meet interesting and open-minded people because this type of people like to meet people that are different from others. In general, these people are very courageous to be able to meet people from different countries. Often, these people have another way of thinking. They often have another skin colour, another religion, and other customs. The big advantage of studying abroad is to begin to think differently and to be able to travel and live all over the world. You will become a world citizen.

Nowadays, people have access to numerous information. The variety of human preferences is huge and vast. In my opinion, every person is unique, so everyone could have different options regarding his life. I tend to think that a calm and long life is my desire. On one hand, a person's behavior means a lot for his type of life. In general, people have done their actions depending on their attitude. I would like to argue that it is crucial to enjoy every moment. Furthermore, the most relevant aspect is to choose your own lifestyle. If it comes to my feelings, I will say that I appreciate a calm life because of my character. If you have an outgoing personality, you will probably tend to choose a more intense life. On the other hand, as far as I am concerned, in general, humans want a long life. I would like to argue that the longevity of life does not matter in a choice related to life intensity. If I aspire to a peaceful and harmonious life, I will have this preference despite its durability. Moreover, people feel their activities in a different way. As far as I know, the more intense an action is, the happier you are. Nevertheless, a calm and long life could offer numerous pleasant activities which can be equal with a short, but deep and energetic life. In conclusion, human preferences could be so different. A long and calm life can be always the best choice because you have the opportunity to make many extraordinary memories in such a lengthy and relaxed life.

It is never acceptable to tell a lie. Why do we keep telling lies anyway? It's a terrible thing to do and it's a terrible precept to live by. It's important to always tell the truth, always be honest with yourself and with others. When a person lies, she first of all is lying to herself and this is a terrible mistake. For example, when I first lied to my mom about what I was feeling, I wasn't able to make a connection with her, she couldn't help me with my mental health issues, so I kept lying but at the end of the day that was killing me inside because it only kept us apart. Furthermore, it's not a good choice to lie and in some countries is a crime condemned by law. With lies, you can destroy people's lives and this will come back to you way more stronger. We never like it when people lie to us, a fake person is never welcome in our environment and whenever that happens we feel betrayed and that person is not seen as a good person at all. In addition, honesty is an important value that we should keep in our thoughts and reflect about our attitudes towards others and the consequences of our lies, because it has serious damage and no one likes it.

Music is important, not only for pleasure, but also for entertainment. Everyone has to struggle in their lives. At such times, they need to reduce their stress. There are many ways to be relaxed. Among them, listening to music is one of the best ways to relax or to boost our mind. Moreover, we can feel and touch different ideas, different feelings, different rhythms, and different types of creativity by listening to music. It makes us happy, and softens our heart too. Without music, probably life would be boring or not interesting at all. In addition, there would be no place for composers or singers to share their feelings. Therefore, I think that music is essential for everyone. It helps us to be happy, to be relaxed, to get the energy for our life now and forever. And it will be one of the important parts of people's lives.

Approximately, all of us listen music on a daily basis, and everyone has his own taste, the common thing is that music helps us get through the day, and although some music might make us sad and a little down, it does help us in one way or another. When we were kids, our school had a music class in it. We all liked it, because it is not the kind of class that needs concentration, it was a little rest in our busy day. Back then, we thought that every school teaches music; later we found out that it is not true. So the question that pops in our head would be: Is it important to teach music in schools? I believe in the importance of teaching music in schools, but it should be an option for the students, because not all of them are interested, like they are not all interested in physics or math. When I was a student, the music class was mandatory, so I did not have the chance to take it or leave it. I might not be interested in music, but in my book, I think it is important for students to have the opportunity of learning music. Music is a tasteful form of art, and it is important to give the interested children a chance to learn it.

When we grow up, we start taking care of ourselves, because we cannot stay under the umbrella of our parents forever, and that is normal. It is a sign of maturity. While studying at university, some students move away and live in a different city away from their parents while others study in their home town with their families. So, which is better? In my book, I think the best idea is moving away during college. Yes, it may be hard at first, but that is an experience that will teach you how to live without someone looking out for you all the time. You are on your own, you will learn to cook, clean, do the dishes, and all of these tasks that you probably would not have known how to do before. It also can teach you financial independence, but it depends on how you earn the money. If you get it from your parents, then you will learn a little. but if you earn it by working, then you will be more flexible about dealing with money and such. The experience of living on your own during college is necessary. You should stay away from drugs and crazy things, but other than than, I advise you to go for it.

I'm curious and I like to learn a lot of things, but my favorite subject of interest is networking with social media. This next year I will improve my knowledge in this field.

Music is universal and it has some common language for all of us. Even if we do not know the words or it is written in some other foreign language, its melody catches us and makes us feel some emotions. I think music is another feature in our lives. Everybody has different tastes in music and when they have some situations, music will always be there for them. When they get happy, playing joyful music and having fun with themselves, sometimes they share this happiness with their close ones. When they hurt, or their heart is broken, they listen to music because it has some healing effects. Even in medical care, sometimes, doctors try to use music as a treatment for their patients' psychology. To conclude, I do not know what life would be without music because I have never experienced it, but I assume it could be boring and leave a big blank in our lives.

Most young students do not work out. That is why most universities want to force their students to work out at least 3 times a week. The universities want to make sports a must-do activity at school and if you do not do sport 3 times a week you have to do the year over. I think young students should work out at least 1 time a week. However I do think the rules of doing the year over goes too far even though working out is good for you, physically and mentally. That is why the universities should make sport obligatory 2 times a week. Firstly, because sport is good for you physically and mentally. You get in better shape and feel better. You also find more peace and can focus better at school, and also at home. Secondly, it should be obligatory 2 times a week, owing to all the students who struggle with their weight. It would be a great opportunity for them to learn about their weight and do something about it if they want to. If it working out is an obligation, there should also be a class to learn about food and how your body responds to food and sports. However, I do think making sport an obligation is too much for some students because nobody knows if 3 extra classes every week is something that is realistic since not everyone has a great home situation. Some students have to work after school or have to help with cleaning at school. So these students could get overworked. All things considered, making sports an obligation would be a great idea to make students feel better. But some students will get overworked and tired, because they have other things to do after school, which takes a lot of energy.

Music impacts our life a lot. It influences our emotions, such as happiness, sadness, depression, or anxiety. There are always suitable types of music for all situations in our life. Music plays an important role in our major life events, such as weddings, graduations, or birthdays. It creates more happiness or alleviates sadness. For example, joyful music makes us happier on our birthdays, especially when our friends and relatives gather together to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song for us. Sad music heals our broken hearts when we lose loved ones. Music reminds me of what happened in the past with both sweet and bitter memories, making my life more meaningful. Sometimes, music could be used as a tool to show love without speaking directly. In my opinion, life would be so boring without music. People might behave inappropriately since there is no music to guide their minds and actions. Finally, we should enjoy music as it has many benefits. We should spread good music with meaningful messages to others to enjoy. Music is indispensable in life.

Although many people say their best holidays were abroad , I prefer for me to be in a quiet, calm place where you can enjoy nature. I had a beautiful holiday in 2019 during the summer time when I stayed two months in the south of France in my birth village. Each morning I got up early to take advantage of the cool temperature just before the sun woke up. I went to the baker's to buy the fresh bread just out of the oven. It was delightful to walk in my village early. Before breakfast I had time to be in the garden listening to the songs of birds and other noises of the countryside. At 8 o'clock breakfast was ready and often the table was laid outside on the terrace just when the sun was beginning to shine. During the day we lived in the shade of the house alternating between reading books and cooling down in the swimming pool. The days finished at midnight in a cool temperature and with the songs of the cicadas.

Time flies. You can see how it's changing people and nature as well. One season starts and another ends. But have you ever thought which one of them is your favourite? Mine is definitely spring, and let me explain to you why. In summer it's too hot, and during the winter and autumn it's too cold, so spring is somewhere in the middle with optimum conditions. Of course, I'm simplifying now. The weather is not the only reason why I love this season of the year so much. But at this point I have to add it's really appealing to me. It's a beautiful time of the year. Everything is waking up from the winter sleep. Plants are growing and painting the world in green, with all those leaves and grass. Birds return from Africa, and every morning sing their outstanding songs to you. It feels like the whole world is joyful, and this happy excitement can be infectious. To cut a long story short, I love spring in my country. You should spend some time outdoors during that period, and if you enjoy being close to nature, as much as I do, you will fall in love with that season.

I think sometimes music is important because it makes us feel better and helps us to concentrate. I think music makes us feel all sorts of things, depending on what type of music we're listening to. For example, if we're listening to pop music, it can make us feel happy and full of energy, or, if we are listening to classical music like Mozart, it can make us feel very relaxed. I think life without music would be very boring and sad, because music makes us feel different and happier. I also think music is a very big part of the world because music and making music is a way for us human beings to express ourselves in a creative and fun way. Also, a life without music wouldn't be fun, because you can dance with music and sing songs, and all of these activities are really fun.

I would like to live a shorter life but much more intense because I think it would make me feel more alive. I do have a long, calm life and I don't think that's enough for me and just the thought of living 100 years like this it does not make me happy at all. I believe life should be challenging, overwhelming, thrilling and full of adventures. I should be able to have the biggest heartbreak ever, to experience an unforgettable breathtaking kiss every day and to have moments that will be with me forever. The best people in life are free to live like this, in an intense way. I would love to achieve all my dreams, do all I ever wanted at once because I think that's what life's about; love, being intense, dramatic, romantic, challenging and to be more realistic, it would be pretty boring to live quietly, just doing tedious stuff, which would kill me inside. I am an intense person and I love to feel emotions. That makes me feel alive. I would love to go to a concert of one of my favorite artists and sing all my favorite songs and dance, scream with all the potential of my lungs and dance until I feel like I'm breaking my bones. That's what I would love to do!

Sometimes people don't like physical exercises and prefer to stay at home to watch television. I think exercise is important for your emotional and physical balance. The first step is physical sport, which is important to maintain your dynamism and ability to move. If you don't do sport your body will become heavy and fat. Little by little, you will have health problems like heart attacks. You will also have difficulties walking because your heart will not have enough blood pressure to send blood around your body. Second, exercie must be part of your life to maintain good mental health. Your spirit needs to be solicited to interact with your body. If you don't do this, your brain can degenerate. In conclusion, human life is moving because your cells of the body must develop. That is the main reason why you must do physical and mental exercises. If you don't exercise you will degenerate and die.

Firstly, music is essential in human beings' lives. Even a child in a mother's womb before it has been born is able to react to a melody. There are studies which prove that playing Mozart's music to these children may help develop their brains and these kids will have brilliant minds. Although we do not put a sharp focus on the music itself, a background tune may have significant benefits for our ability to concentrate on a certain problem. Plenty of surgeons listen to relaxing music while they are in the surgery room since it has a relaxing music while they are in the surgery room since it has a flourishing effect on their work. To add more, a lot of people are prone to evaluate others according to the kind of music they are listening to. Only a style of music may connect people with the same feelings. We may see huge groups of people visiting metal gigs. They all share the same enthusiasm for that kind of music, while different group of people see metal music just as a discordant tune without any sense.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you as I wish to bring up the matter concerning the banning of the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I am speaking in the name of our community when I say that this idea is quite exaggerated and I also suggest that you should do the opposite and offer free wi-fi in some areas of the town. Firstly, as many students reside in our town, they will all need to use their mobile phones or gadgets to keep in touch with professors or colleagues. Not only that but human connection is necessary nonetheless. Since we all have relatives that live far away from us, we have to keep in touch. By banning the use of mobile phones in public spaces like these, the town's population will be distressed and outraged. Also, in case of emergencies such as a car accident, people will need to use their phones. Secondly, the banning of mobile phones in public places can bring up the rate of criminal activity. More people will use their phones while the authorities are not paying attention thus taking up the risk of getting charged with a fine. I do not suppose you wish to have a town that is renamed for housing criminals. Simply implying that people will suddenly stop using their phones is absurd in this case. I thank you for considering my opinion on this matter and I hope it helped you make a better decision. Yours faithfully, Anna Todd.

Music is one of the most enjoyable things in the world. Everyone listens to music. There are so many kinds of music and every person loves a different kind of music. Therefore, people do love music and music is important for them. Can people live without music, or if there was not any kind of music how would the lives of people be? These are the questions that everyone answers differently, but it is sure that without music people cannot live. If we want to answer the question, 'What would life be like if there was not any music?' we have to find someone who has never listened to music. However, there is no one who has never listened to music in his or her life. Therefore, without music people cannot live. People have been making music for centuries. A person who lived in ancient times listened to music and a person who lives in the 21st century is still listening to music. Thus, people have been making music since they exist. To sum up, without music people cannot live. They are always creating new music. And thus music is important for everyone whether he lived in ancient times or the 21st century.

I think that music is an important part in our lives because through music we can get joy and connect with other people. Music can also make you happy, for example, when you had a hard day at work you can listen to music and it will maybe cheer you up. Music is also socially important because people sing songs together and go to concerts together which improves their relationships. If there wasn´t any music in the world, I think the world would be a lot more boring because music is an exciting thing. And if you are really good at it you could also make it your job, how fun is that!? Without music a lot of people would lose their hobby and their passion. Music is also a big economic thing because a lot of money is put into the music industry, so that is also an important thing about music. So what I think is that music is important for our lives and our mental health.

Although people people consider travelling an action to go from one point to another point, I prefer to consider travelling an experience that starts from a point and continues throughout the journey before reaching its destination. In the future, we will rediscover the charm of the journey and not only the destination. Why? Because with the new environmental requirements, we will travel less far than before out of the obligation of reducing carbon emissions. We will also find the advantage of travelling to each place we visit. For me, this behaviour will create an opportunity to discover the whole patrimony of the area where we live. You will see the beautiful monuments but also boost your creativity. This attitude will considerably change the way of travelling. First, it will promote our own culture and stop us from thinking that everything is better in another country. Second, it will allow people to build with other people around where they live. For example, we will know there are delicious apples on the farm near your house, or we will be able to do business with people we meet at a fair in our area. Travel will become more human in the future.

Actually I would prefer a shorter but much more intense life. Although my life will face a bitter taste of life, it will be ending soon then I don't need to live so much. No matter if my life is calm or intense, I would prefer a shorter life. I don't want to live that much. I can't live until 100 in this country. I don't want to have my children then if my life extends for 100 years. I need to have a lot of money that can pay for my entire life. It hard to have such money in my country. I don't know how to get that money. These days we have a lot to spend on. If you want to live a better life that means you need to spend more money. My country doesn't have any finance to support their citizens, you need to live your life on your own only. You can't count on your government or country. I think there are not many people in this country that can live with happiness. Those kinds of people need to exploit so many people then they will have a lot of money, I don't want to be like those people. In my country there are many choices so I prefer to die early than to live longer.

Lying is considered a sin in many cultures and religions, and I believe it is a sin too, but each rule has exceptions, therefore, there are some specific situations in which lying would be a viable option. The first situation is in war. Imagine yourself taken hostage by your country's enemies during war time, and they investigated you, and asked you to tell them about your country's weapons, numbers of soldiers, and secret matters. It is a foregone conclusion that telling the truth here is wrong, it is deemed as betrayal. The second situation would be in marriage, and I do not want to be on the wrong foot here. Thus, I do not mean big or twisted lies, like cheating and lying about it. Instead, I mean small lies which would make her happy. For instance, if your wife was not attractive during pregnancy, and she probably will not be, it would be really wrong to tell the truth to her face, even if she asked. Lying in these kinds of situations is also crucial, because the truth will not be beneficial for anyone. Instead it will hurt her feelings and make her feel less confident about herself and her body. By my book, I believe that these two situations are the only ones that the person should lie in. Other than that, it is wrong.

There have been some rumours about legislation to ban the use of mobile phones in public transport, shops, and restaurants, basically, any closed public place. I am writing you today to express my thoughts about the matter, and to give you some suggestions. I believe that your idea is good, but it is a little bit extreme, and it is not a viable option. It is true that individuals are using their mobile phones non-stop these days, and it is also true that this excessive use is causing a lot of issues and accidents, but banning them that way is going to cause another problem, because someone may need to use his or her phone for an emergency, thus, a complete ban is not the best solution. However, we can all agree that the use of social media in public places is not necessary most of the time, the same logic applies to games. Therefore, we should ban these kinds of apps, which are not helpful at all. In this way we can have a suitable solution, which is not so radical. At the same time that we achieve the desired outcome. I really want to thank you for giving me the time to read my suggestion. I hope that it was helpful for you and I think that you are doing a great job.

This essay involves a delicate issue that I have been thinking about a lot before answering and after having heard other people's experiences. It seems a very easy issue and I doubt that people would prefer to be rich, but in a bad state of health. What I mean is that being healthy should be our main priority and all of us should take care not only of our personal state of health, but should also think about others' health. Being rich and wealthy is not so important as many people think, and all the cases of rich people's illnesses are a clue that making a lot of money does not make you happy. What people do not understand is that they should not push their luck, because they run the risk of losing what is the most precious thing: their health. It is true that people have no control of what life brings them, but they cannot spend their whole life looking for richness and wealth, we know very well how we risk getting down on our luck. If our destiny is to be rich and wealthy, we must just let nature take its course.

From the beginning of time people have tried to somehow find a way to elongate their life span. Things such as the philosopher's stone and witchcraft were invented for this reason. Even nowadays people dream of living over 100 years but is it really worth it? In my opinion, living a short but much more intense life can easily compensate for those 100 years of calm as it is believed that you need to live your life to the fullest. While being aware that your time on this earth is limited, you feel the need to cherish every moment. Having a short life reminds you that moments such as birthdays or celebrations need to be remembered and cherished properly. Secondly, living for 100 years could not only get tiring but also lonely. Having to see all your loved ones pass away can break your heart. Calm could come in handy when you're old but while you're at the peak of your youth, the need for calm goes away quite quickly. For example, a 20 year old regards calm as a need only during weekends while for a 60 year old person, calm can be crucial to their everyday life. To conclude, the sweet but short moments you live in a shorter life can be more fulfilling than when you live a longer but calmer life. The intensity of a shorter life is always more welcome than the boredom and repetitiveness of a longer life span.

Dear participants in the town council, I would like to express my opinion regarding the latest idea about banning the use of cell phones in common areas such as restaurants and shops, as well as public transport. I am actually aware of the environmental as well as biological risks of the pollution due to electromagnetic waves, and the very little worry people have about that. First of all because people do not 'feel' the electromagnetic waves, in the sense that it is a pollution that doesn't make any noise, or smell bad, nor is it even 'seen' as wasted material. Nevertheless, it is with no doubt acting on our ears warming, as the cell phone electromagnetic waves are of the same kind as the microwave, thus enabling our water molecules to 'twist', producing warming as a secondary effect. Unfortunately this kind of molecular movement sometimes creates headaches or even tumors (most of the times benign), especially in young people, as they are made of much more water than adults. For all these reasons I would agree with the council's initiative, for the 'precautionary principle' that would induce us not to use cell phones intensively before a clear scientific statistic is produced by our health organization. Anyway, before taking such a decision, I would suggest taking initiatives in order to make people discuss the problem with competent doctors. In fact I think that you need first of all to give the knowledge, then you can convince people to accept the rule.

Currently, few high schools presume students to prove a voluntary work to graduate. But does that just waste their time or does it promote the personality development of their students? Firstly, undeniably most students experience schools as too theoretical rather than practical. It seems to them that they learn something with a low impact for their future. Or do you have to acquire broadening skills - think about arts or sports - to apply to a maths degree? Therefore, volunteers could gain real-life experience, which would top the dry school material off. Additionally, students have to choose from a range of voluntary work that suits their interests best and learn essential life lessons such as communicating with others or being empathetic. Lastly and not less relevant is that students with a volunteering background set themselves apart from other peers. This enables them to gain benefits in an application process for university or a job. To sum up, I think that more schools should assume students to do volunteer work. On the one hand, this would broaden the horizon of the students academically and on the other hand personally.

These paragraphs contain the question whether university students should live on their own while they are attending school or whether they should live at home. I personally think that it is less laborious to study at home, because you do not need to look for another affordable accommodation and you can save your money due to missing rent you do not need to pay. To sum up, this is a great choice if your degree course is taught at your home university. Despite that, it is obvious that some prospective students move away because of their interest in a specific study field. Furthermore, you will mature quicker by managing your own life, that covers the daily shopping in a supermarket or arranging a doctor's appointment, and you will feel more confident successively. Moreover, it could be beneficial to study even abroad in order to learn a foreign language and to represent yourself as a person with international attributes. That would ease your job search after graduation enormously, if you would prefer to study in an international working environment.

Since a well-known magazine for English language learners has asked for reviews about useful resources for learning English I recommend Write & Improve with Cambridge whose function is to improve your writing skills step by step. If you open this writing tool, you can choose between various tasks which require a different level of English. After that, you start to write a text and hand it in after you finished. Subsequently, a review of your written text emerges and you can see what you have done correctly and where you can improve. Now you correct your mistakes and hand in your revised text to check whether it is right. On the one hand, this method requires a highly responsible and motivated student who seeks his mistakes over a long time, but on the other hand, it can be extremely unsatisfactory when you do not fix some mistakes. Although this tool is a good way to self-study, it is even better with someone's help in fixing some mistakes. In my view, every English student should use this tool or a similar for enhancing his writing skills. In particular you can learn at your own speed and focus on your developing fields. Nevertheless, it can be frustrating to seek mistakes for a long time, but then you need to go on.

People around the world plan their life differently based on their wishes. Two possible life plans that I feel deserve a mention are to live a long calm life or a short intense life. Firstly, everybody must live as long as possible to be able to fulfil every wish. Referring to this, there is no doubt that a long life suits best this life goal because the elderly spend more time on Earth and can look back at a long life span. If anyone pursues to reach that, he needs to live healthily and to stay out of any danger. Another life plan is to act less calmly and to do more exciting as well as dangerous things. Moreover, they wish to do more dangerous activities because of the adrenaline rush. In particular, some people feel more vital during these nastier situations and can relax from the monotony of their routine life. In addition, these people think that they should do anything that they want before they get too old to do it. I think that a more calm life would correspond to my expectations way better. In more detail, I am not a person that seeks exciting situations and I feel more comfortable in a structured daily routine. But most important is that I want to live as long as possible because I have several plans for my future.

Young people and sports Should sport be obligatory for young people? Many would argue that no. Others could see this from a different perspective. Let's try to take a look at both opinions. According to statistics every fifth child is overweight in the UK schools. " Just do more sport and eat less" some people could say. But it's not that simple. It's not easy to "just do sport." Young people can be disgussed by sport because of their early childhood memories. For example Harry was forced to do at least five sport activities a week, and not one was interesting, nor enjoyable, for him. Because of this now, when he can take some responsibility into his hands, he doesn't do any sport, because he thinks all of them are alike. On the other hand there are people like Sarah, who are finding their passion in their early childhood. Nowadays she is a basketball player in the national league, playing at least five times a week. Although she was not forced to choose exceptionally this sport, it has been found thanks to PE in school, where sports were changing almost every lesson. This had fortunately led to her outstanding success. Without a doubt she is a role model for many young ones. To summarize, this question is not as easy to answer as it may seem. Seldom do we see as ambitious young people as Sarah. But still her story tells us something. She could've tried all the sports in her childhood and nobody was forcing her to do any of them. Therefore she is doing sport until now without planning to stop. Other people don't have to be as active as her but finding any hobby in sports helps them in their healthy lifestyle. All in all, I'm certain that young people should try as much sport as possible, but forcing them to do what they don't like won't help the cause.

In my opinion, music has an important role in everyone's life. First of all, there are several kinds of music, and each one can have a different impact on your mind. For example, there are some songs which are made for sensitizing people, whereas other ones are made in order to lift the mood. Another key point to remember is that a particular song can be part of a special moment of someone's life; therefore, that song has a special meaning for that person. Some research studies stated that a song can really change a life; for instance, it has been proved that it can really help a person get out of a state of depression. In sum, life without music would not be as great as it is, since the rhythm and lyrics can really have a huge impact on people's mind.

Music is definitely important for humankind. It indicates how our lives are going from the past to the present. Through music and its lyrics, for example and its lyrics, forexample politics, religion, culture, and love. Music is one of the crucial parts of our lives, so it plays an important role in alleviating people's feelings when they encounter tough situations. In addition, it encourages people to show their true feelings in terms of afflictions or political issues. This is the reason why life cannot be lived without music. If there were no music in our lives, life would not have gorgeous moments and people would not have imagination or creativity to create magnificent lyrics or songs. As a result, it is doubtless that knowledge or religious teaching is difficult to convey to people. In my view, decisively, I cannot live without music because music always soothes my temper when I feel frustrated by my problems. Moreover, it helps me to have more concentration while I am working or reading books.

Although many people think that school in the past was better than today, I believe the needs of people throughout time are different and the manner to teach people must be different. For this reason, the school of the future will be more connected and more human. Access to information will increase rapidly and the teacher's role will need to be more interactive and based on the reflection of helping students to think. This last point will be crucial because the huge amount of information bombarding people in their daily life must be chosen and selected by people to make the best choice in their private or professional life. The school must teach psychology and a collective sport like balance of your life. The teachers must become like a coach to prepare their students to fight again their own thoughts and to be benevolent with their colleagues, teacher, and parents. Therefore the future school must be based more on knowing how to be than on knowing how to do.

I firmly believe that you should always tell the truth or at least do not lie. It is one of the rules from Jordan Peterson's book and I have been acting upon it for a while with great results in my mental health. Of course you can't push it to extremes. You shouldn't ignore the purpose of white lies. I still believe that children should believe that they are receiving Christmas presents from a little Jesus and that if they misbehave they will be taken by a devil. There is a complicated dichotomy in case of leadership. Your people deserve the truth but on the other hand they should be spared from some deeds of their own boss. It is about the morale of the team. An extreme example may be at sea. Sailors in the middle of the ocean on their transatlantic voyage with not enough food. Should the sailors be informed about the situation or should it be kept secret? Is the threat of a mutiny less important then the truth? The only hope of survival is to proceed and hold on with maximum effort. To tell the truth is the opposite. So this is an example when the proper solution is not telling the truth but simply to be quiet and, with that, not telling a lie.

Although many people think TV is only for recreational activities, I am convinced that TV can also teach a lot of things. Because there are many TV shows with different subjects, like science, religion, literature, nature... you have opportunities to know these themes better and to be able to talk about them. These TV shows can be the bases of study at school or university and at least the first step to raise the interest in a subject. With the development of TV Channels, TV is also an open mind on foreign and linguistic culture. For children it is a convenient manner to learn a foreign language when they watch movies or other TV shows. Proof of that is in the north of Europe where English TV channels are better developed than in the south of Europe, people speak and write English more fluently than people in the south.

Music is a way of expression and can influence in people's mood making them experience different senses. Without music, people would not have a filter to express and share their feelings and thoughts in peace because music allows people to show their personal sides Music is important because it can determine the mood in a place or the formality of an event because depending on the music played, people can behave in one way or another. Music opens a wide way of opportunities to experience new sensations in different places and getting to know people with different manners. For example, the behaviour at a concert is not the same as the behaviour at an opera. Music allows people to experience those kinds of feelings and environments because of its different styles, and the best part is, it is not necessary to be an expert. Life without music would not allow people to create and find a place of expression, and they could not develop their creativity. To conclude, music is one of the best resources for people's expression.

In my opinion, it is imperative. As we see, the more modern their life, the more people are lazy. And there are negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, particularly many people don't intend to change their lifestyle unless it comes to limitattion. Therefore, I think all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week because it has many benefits for them. Sports activities have great importance in your life. They help you to be more healthy than before you do that, drop pressure and suffer from less variety of health problems. Suppose that you worked continuously for 5 days, I dare say that you would feel tired. And then some people will reward themselves with a cup of tea or a cup of coffee. But they don't < u00B4 > that it has negative effect on your health like lost memory, dark eyes, etc., although it helps you to be conscious for a short time. Instead of using it, you should do exercise. Because it has more benefit than drinking tea or coffee, such as being more alert, flexibility, increasing performance and so on. Sometimes, doing sports makes us create ideals. Scientific research shows that people who always do exercise rarely suffer less from health problems than a lazy person. Why should students or children do exercise 3 times per week? Simply, children have to learn many subjects and under pressure from their parents, their teacher or even their classmates. Therefore, they need to do it to drop them, stretch their body, relax their face, etc. On the other hand, it makes students create healthy habits, and they enjoy their lifestyle and find smiles after the stressful class time. In conclusion, sports activities are important for our lifestyle. Scientists research that people who love sport always love themselves more than the others and they also suffer from various problems involving too much health.

In my opinion I think that medical doctors need other colleagues to do their job as well as needing the best equipment possible. Another reason is medical doctors want different kind of services to live. NA,. these services in rural areas are not enough for them. Fewer people live in rural areas than cities. According to experts you need a doctor more in the city than in the rural areas. In think to solve this problem more people would have to live in the villages and they would have more services and improve their equipment. Even if rural areas are far from cities that's not a problem, because they can have one doctor for almost a hundred citizens. To sum up, the best solution is to increase the population of the rural areas, which will make more doctors want to live in these areas, therefore this problem will change in the future.

In my country, Myanmar, there are only three seasons, summer, winter, and the rainy season. All of them have their own beauty and characteristics. And if I have to choose my favourite one, it will definitely be winter. I really hate hot days. Also, I don't like being wet all day. Therefore, winter is the only season I feel comfortable in. No matter how cool it is, I love it. Besides, both my birthday and Christmas are in winter. So I usually get many presents and this is one of the reasons why I love winter very much. Moreover, I always go hiking with my friends in winter. As we all get Christmas holiday, I can meet with all of my friends, including those from other towns. And going hiking with them is always adventurous and fascinating. And the most important thing is that I met my first love in winter. And it was very sweet, although it was just a one-sided love. And for these reasons, winter has become my favourite.

Most medical doctors want to work where they will make much more money. Why is that? What a naive question. Of course they want to work in the cities. They want the money and the patients. It is something different to care about a farmer who works long days and nights in fields than about your client who is a city office worker. The question of how to solve this is the proper one. I think that for some medical doctors money is more important than the work and for others it is vice versa. So we have to focus on those who prefer money in front of easy work. On those doctors we can focus our attention through benefits based on working out of the capital. Of course this wouldn't solve the problem, only the symptoms. On the other hand, I am from Czechia and, to be honest, this problem is not really important for us. The employers are obliged to pay for health insurance for all their employees and it is free for those who are not working.

Even though it is one of the most researched and studied subjects, we can never know what is going to happen in the future. We can predict, but we can never be sure about it. Although it is unknown, people try to plan their future, and every one of us has his own preferences. Some people feel that it would be better to to live a long calm life while others consider a short intense life to be more appealing, so what is better? It is the kind of question where there is no right or wrong. If you asked me, I would not have a definite answer. Both of the choices are tempting, and have their own advantages and disadvantages. The first choice is tempting because it is a satisfying kind of life, you study, graduate, marry, have kids, then you probably see them entering the same cycle that you were in, except for some minor changes. Maybe it seems boring, but it is nice to be able to live calmly, and get old while watching your grandkids play and have fun. The second choice is a nice one as well, because you just live twenty or thirty years, and do the things that you love, then die calmly after achieving your goals. I believe that I would choose a mix of those two, even though I cannot really choose anything.

In my opinion it's a shame that they must complete volunteer work in order to graduate. I think that all students have to do some volunteer work because they want to not only because it's a mandatory requirement. I believe that young people today waste a lot of time doing nothing. All day they are connecting on smartphones or playing games. Instead, they could help other people or do something for the community. I hope in the future young people think about how they spend their time because it is more useful to help other people than to stay connected for hours on the Internet. Finally, I think that this high school is doing a good thing for the community demanding students complete some hours as a volunteer. I'm sure that young people learn a lot in their time as a volunteer and they will repeat the experience.

Health is important for human life. Doing exercise is one the most important things for a happy and healthy life. But there are also other important things, such as a good diet, for example. I, sadly, am not an athletic girl, but I try to keep in shape. I go running every day, weather permitting. I usually run and walk one hour a day. A workout is not enough to keep the body healthy, trying to eat only healthy food is also important. Eating healthily means eating as many vegetables and fruits as possible and delay all junk food and soft drinks that cause obesity, and in extreme cases death. Going to a gym may help weight-loss, but it is also an economical way to reduce stress just because doing a workout several times a week can improve the blood flow and make you regain energy and calmness, maybe after a bad day at work. In my opinion, thought doing exercise and eating well is a good thing from a medical point of view, losing weigh for aesthetic purposes is the worst thing people can do.

Nowadays, television is an important part of our lives. Television entertains, but, in some cases, doesn't educate. On television now, there are only reality shows that, in my opinion, cannot be educative, especially for children. If we want to analyze the percentage of educative programs in a daily TV schedule, we observe that there aren't documentaries or science programs that can involve young people watching television to learn something. Every year on TV, there are more and more cooking shows. They can be useful for learning some new recipes. In short, TV schedules ought to air more documentaries and cultural programs. Another opportunity is showing new films, and not always black and white films. TV schedules can also air reality TV, but not like this. Although reality TV is useful to raise the share of channels, it does not educate. I prefer to watch a three-hour documentary rather than reality TV!

In my opinion I think it's better to move away during your university time. If they move out of their home, I'm sure that those students will improve more than the students that are with their families at home. The reason is that you must make your own meals and go shopping every week, whereas the other students all think things are done by their parents. The responsibility that one student needs far away from his home is bigger than the other group of students. On the other hand, studying time is different when you are are living out of your home, because you need to be more organized. You need to have a schedule with all the tasks that you should do every day, you need to clean your room, the kitchen and the bathroom too. It's hard cleaning all the time and you have less time to study, but you will be ready for the future.

My favourite season of the year is summer. I love summer because first of all there is no school, so I am free. There is no homework, no extra work, no studying. I can play computer games and I can hang out with my friends. Second, in summer I can swim in the pool or sea. When I swim in the sea or pool , I have a lot of fun. In addition, water is good for me. Also, I like hot and cool weather. In this weather I need to cool down so I swim in the sea. Third, we can go on a vacation to the western cities of Turkey. For instance, Antalya, Bodrum, Muğla. We can go on cruise holidays. It is fun to go on a cruise vacation. Also, hotel holidays with an aqua park are very nice because sliding through the water park is an adrenaline-filled activity and I love adrenaline. Also, we can go abroad. To sum up, summer makes me happy, this season is comfortable and this season is my favourite season.

I disagree that computers and tablets should replace books in schools and universities. I know that computers and tablets are very convenient and aren't bulkier than books. However, students should use books because they can check the pages that bother them quickly. In addition, we can mark a colour directly on the pages and take notes on the pages of books directly. Currently, computers and tablets may do the same things, but we can't erase completely what you write in books and the books get dirty, which makes some people confident because we can see study records. Other reasons are that students should be familiar with print type than digital type. My opinion is that pirnt type expand expands our imagination and that's bigger chance than after becoming adult. Therefore books have more advantages than disadvantages and I recommend that students should use books in schools and universities.

In my opinion it depends on the kind of job, because if the offices have no walls separating employees, it's noisier if you need to make a call. On the other hand, if in the job it's necessary to talk with your partners, it's better than there are no walls in the office. In your office you always need your own space to do your job the best way possible. Without walls, creativity and communication will be better than if you have a wall and you can't see your partners. If in your job you need to be concentrated, such as being a designer, it's more useful to have walls to do your job better without distractions. Another reason is it depends on your boss because if he wants to see his employees, it's easier to do it without walls. I hope it's a group decision and I'm afraid that not always all the employees will agree with the same solution.

Dear members of the City Council, With this letter I would like to remind you of our constitution. According to Article Two of our Basic Law, every person has the right to act as he or she wishes. Therefore, your plan to ban cell phones on public transportation, in stores, and in restaurants is unlawful unless you can show good cause. Restrictions on our right to act as we wish are only possible if you have a good reason for doing so. However, you have not given such a reason, nor have you explained why you want to ban cell phones in the places already mentioned. As far as I can tell, there is no danger from the activities you intend to ban. Nor can I see any other good reason to enforce your idea. I can only assume that you are looking to patronize your citizens. It seems to me to be an idea aimed at preventing people from using cell phones in situations where a well-behaved person would not use these devices. However, while this cause is understandable, it is an impermissible restriction on our constitutional rights. Social norms should never be imposed on people by law. In the long run, such overregulation will lead to dissatisfied citizens and unrest. Therefore, I believe that you should refrain from your idea of regulating the use of cell phones in public transportation, restaurants or stores.

The reasons for many doctors to choose the big city is because they will receive more money and there are more doctors in the place, so it's more difficult to to work in a hospital located in a big city. Although it's easier to pass in a small city, the bad aspect is the salary that isn't good, the local people don't have good salaries and the government don't pay a fair price to live there. The solution is simple, the government needs to invest more in small villages to solve the inequality problem. If they do that the doctors will be more interested in changing the place and the health will be better, solving the problem of the big competitions in rich places, and the small places won't lack good doctors. Here in Brazil we have the same problem, which, in part, for a time was solved with a government program when Dilma Roussef was president, because they started to pay for Cuban doctors. Nowadays we don't have this program any more because the new president fired everybody.

Between the two possibilities I would like to have a long calm life for 100 years. I'm opting for this option because of my personality. I'm a quiet person, who doesn't like to do things hastily because acting like this can cause you to commit a lot of errors. Other than that, I see the point of having intense activity but I don't feel like I can afford and maintain this lifestyle, my body wouldn't be able to resist such condition and with age it will become more and more difficult to maintain an intense life. In the end, why do I choose a long calm life? Highlighting different motivations other than how my temperament is, other reasons for liking this type of life is that you can have the possibility to see the little things. What I want to say is that behaving like this can give you the opportunity to appreciate and feel the little gestures of the one you love and return them. Also, you can have the possibility to think deeply about nature and how it's complex, beautiful and amazing. I think it's essential to take our time to understand nature and creation better and deeply. I feel like I can understand a bit more the complexity and the depth of creation. The most important discoveries were made by analyzing nature and trying to copy its mechanisms. In the end, these are the reasons why I prefer a long, calm life.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter in response to the recently published proposal banning the use of mobile phones in public settings and I would like to express my disapproval of the above proposal. It came to my attention that public transport, shops and restaurants will be mainly affected by this newly created idea. To begin with, I would massively appreciate it if the Council would like to cast a bit more light for us on why they are thinking this would be a good move. A far as I am concerned, none of the reasons we have been presented with were supported by any scientific evidence. Therefore, I am demanding the town Council present the public with their backup with scientific arguments. Moreover, neither I nor anyone in my family had been ever approached and asked to give our own opinion about the topic. Should our local representatives not be more in touch with their people when it comes to making such drastic changes in our lives? Do you think this is the right way to treat your citizens? Well, I must strongly disagree with you, then. And finally, to sum it up, I would like to propose organizing another meeting where everyone who might be affected by those changes was able to express their views.

Although people think being rich is the most important thing in their life, I am definitely sure health is my first priority. The first report is when people have lost their health definitively or just temporally, they become a lot more sensitive than people that don't have health problems. It is always good to reflect on this priority when you have a small health problem, like you break your arm or just have flu. When you are obligated to stop all of your activities and you must stay at home. At this moment you can say to yourself: even if I were very rich I couldn't become healthy like I want to. Nature is stronger than you and you need to be patient. These situations improve your humility and are the best way to understand the higher value of life compared to only being focused on money. Life is a balance between your health and the need to have money to live. It is important to take care of yourself. Good mental health is the first step to being healthy.

Music. Not a thousand words could portray its inner self. Music has played and always will play a tremendous role in our society. It is the backbone of our modern civilisation. Moreover, it enables us to communicate with people around the world. Its beauty has brought us together and unites us all over the world. Could you imagine a world without music? I certainly cannot. Whether we are having a bad day or we are desperately seeking some alternation in our life, music is always the right answer to it. It enhances our emotional state and combats stress. Additionally, it makes us feel worthy and unique. We just live in the moment. So, as I already mentioned in the beginning, I would not want to live in a world without music. We should be grateful for music and be cheerful with it every day of our life.

MY NEW SCHOOL YEAR The fundamental purpose of this report is no other than to get to plan my new English school year by specifying the most important objectives I would like to have achieved once this year comes to an end. Let us get straight to the point and tackle the heart of the matter. The areas of my learning I am pleased with the most: It is fair to draw attention to the fact that learning English is a need for everybody nowadays beyond doubt whatsoever. When it comes to studying English I cannot help but say that my most highlighted strength is no other than my writing skills, and so I want it to continue being this way. In that spirit, my intention is to keep on exercising it. The areas of my learning I want to improve: With regard to my weaknesses, not only do I find it difficult to express myself speaking English but I am also aware of my difficulties to understand some different accents, such as is the case with the Irish or Scottish one. Should there be any way which contributes to making it easier for me to understand them, I would be delighted to explore it. It is crystal clear that being able to understand all the English accents is what strikes people the most. Achieving my goals: It goes without saying that once I overcome my drawbacks concerning the usage of the English language, I will be more confident when using that language whenever I find it appropriate and it will also encourage me more to continue studying it for good, as we never stop learning. I am well aware of my needs to strengthen my weakest points of learning, and, by doing so, I will surely overcome my flaws. In a nutshell, I would like to conclude by pointing out that by performing all of what I mentioned above, I will manage to improve my English level rapidly.

Although my pen friend likes to watch police films, I prefer films with adventure and initiate people to know how. That is the reason why my favourite movie is Wind. The subject of this film is sailing to win the America Cup. There is a lot of suspense, like a police movie. The story of the movie is very interesting because you follow all the different steps before the win. The first step is when the Americans lost the cup against New Zealand. You will be able to analyse why they lost and you will see the interesting tactics of their competitor. The second step will be the recapture of this title by the American team.

Generally, music is very important in our lives. Music is a cure. When I was a boy, I listened to rock a lot, now I listen to pop because it is better for my good mood.

Tomorrow, I will be listening to the second album of AC/DC and I think that tomorrow evening I will have listened to all of the best songs.

In recent decades, the health of students has started to decline. An inactive lifestyle, accelerated by the negative impacts of video games and streaming platforms, has resulted in higher obesity rates. One burning question has emerged: Should we force school children and even university students to participate in sports activities at least three times per week? This essay intends to make it abundantly clear that strict regulation is not a solution at all. There can be no doubt that the physical state of myriads of children has worsened due to the rise of globalization and digitisation. With thousands and thousands of children addicted to video games and social media, the allure of going outside is comparatively small. This has certainly changed over time. The leisure time our parents and grandparents spent in their childhood seems to be worlds apart from ours. Few people would dispute the fact that exploring the wild is an integral part of growing up. There are those who argue that kids should not be put in a risky situation. Helicopter parents are instantly watching every single step of their beloved offspring. However, in that way they are indirectly hindering their child's development. Kids need to spend time outside. It is widely believed that children need to make decisions on their own to make independent decisions which thus enhances personality development. The proposal of forcing children to do sport activities is quite similar to the approach of the autocratic regime in China. In order to counteract the "feminisation" of society which refers to the up-bringing of a generation full of spoiled only children, the government has implemented a sport scheme. However, we - as members of a democratic society - should set a good example. In conclusion, children should not be forced to do sports involuntarily. These initiatives would not improve the situation overall. We have to counteract these recent developments by supporting children not to use their smartphones all the time and instead take a walk outside. All our problems would diminish within a second.

Dear town council, I am writing in reference to your idea to forbid the use of mobile phones in public. I disagree with your opinion and will state my arguments with the help of examples. Firstly, mobile phones are used by most people for keeping in touch with each other, for working activities outside the office and to inform themselves about the daily news. You will probably reply to this in the following way: Everybody is distracted, because there is so much activity in their mobile phones, and social communication decreases in public. NA,. new technologies, like mobile phones, computers or headphones, to name just a few, are part of our today's culture and too relevant to ban them. Furthermore, you forget another important aspect: social network use is increasing and especially among younger people. Its advantage is that people across the world - even the most distant from each other - can interact with each other. It is known by most that this is a relevant factor of globalisation, which enables us to act together for the first time in human history. But the winning argument is that the use of mobile phones saves a lot of time. If you needed to search for information for ages, you would get a result in a much shorter time span now. Time that could be used to go outside or to do engage voluntarily. Therefore I strongly recommend declining your idea of banning mobile phones in public. Yours sincerely, Jan.

Music - A part of your world The majority of people have different opinions about music and its forms. Some don't actually enjoy music at all. The question is, are there times when music is significant and vital, for example, for our psychohygiene? Is it sometimes required and necessary to listen to music? Certain people believe that the shape of sounds is highly calming to our ears. The sounds may make us feel better and pleased, even when we listen to them passively and don't really give attention to details such as the words of the songs. Owing to that, it is clear that music may reduce, for example, stress, depressive thoughts, wrath, sloth, and many other wrong emotions. What would life look like without music? Depends on what type of a person you are. If you don't fancy music much, then you'd be probably just fine, but if the case is the opposite, you might be in trouble. In conclusion, it is highly considered by humanity that music is an inseparable, necessary, essential, and fundamental part of it and that it makes us feel great.

First of all, nowadays, listening to music is becoming a habit for every human that is living on this earth. Also, there are different times that everyone listens to music. For example, some people like listening to music before going to bed, and they feel relaxed at that moment. Furthermore, some people like listening to music when they are studying. For this reason, they feel more concentrated on their studies. Besides that, some people will prefer listening to music while doing housework. Listening to music gives them more energy to work. Also listening to music gives people a sense of space in their lives and so more people want to listen to music. For instance, some people listen to music when they are sad or anxious to release their pain. However, some people listen to music when they are in a good mood. Indeed, everyone who is living on this earth has a specific goal for listening to music, such as listening to music while studying, doing housework, or bad moments.

I know that some people need music in their lives, while I also think that not all people need music in their life. First of all, music is not the only way to make life better. For example, my hobby is running. Thus, when I have time or need to feel relaxed, I usually go to a gym and run by using a treadmill, while I don't listen to music when I have time. In addition, my husband also has hobbies other than music. He is a person who feels happy when he makes new programs. Additionally, music is not necessary for everyone to live life. There are many essential things for our life such as sleep and food. However, we can live life without music. In fact, a long long time ago, people lived life without music. Thus, I believe that music is not needed for our lives.

I just discovered the tool named "Write and Improve" recently a month ago. This tool is easily reached whatever device you use. You can use this tool from your computer, mobile phone and tablet. This tool will encourage you to use their program for improving your writing. You can start with an easy one that is not too difficult for many people to surrender. I think that is why they need to start with something easy. In these days there are a lot of tools that can help people with writing skills but if you start with the hardest ones, many people will turn that software off. If you are familiar with the easy ones, then they will recommend you to go to the next level that is a little bit harder than the previous one but this level is not that hard. I think this tool provides a lot of different levels so you will find the level that suits you. And they have other modes such as Ielts, Toic and other tests that are well-known by a lot of people. This is the best future that a lot of people use. I have tried around ten practices and I think it is quite similar to the real test. If you find a tool that can help your writing skill, I think "Write and Improve" is the best choice you are looking for. You will find what level suits you and then practise and then go to the next level. And they also have a test mode that is like the real one.

Living an unhealthy lifestyle leads to unhealthy people and being inactive is a main reason for health issues. Nevertheless, should we really force university students and school children to do sports activities three times a week? Nowadays, students are already stressed out at school and university and often while writing exams there is not much free time left to include sports in the daily life. It would be really stressful for some students to start forcing them to do sports because it does not fit in their life. When forced to do something, the activity becomes less fun and can sometimes not be enjoyed which leads to demotivation. Furthermore, what would the consequences be if someone does not do sports activities three times a week? I think it would be unfair to punish someone because they were studying instead of working out. On the other hand, sport is great to help with physical issues and mental health problems and considering the current state some of the students and children are in physically and mentally, sport activities would be a great way to help them out and to decrease obesity and depression. On the whole, sports activities are excellent to create a work life balance which is often missed by a lot of students, especially when they study a lot. In addition, to stay healthy in the future you need some sort of activity during the week if you do not want to become ill when you are old. In recent years the number of obese children has increased which is also caused by a lack of movement because today most children play video games which is why motivating them to do more activities would be a good idea. Last but not least, if one finds the right sports activity, it is often a lot of fun and afterwards you are more likely to be happy because your body sends out endorphines. In conclusion, I think forcing students and children to do sports activities three times a week is not the right way, but to change something is necessary. Sport needs to be more integrated in school and university which would also make it more comfortable for students to integrate sport in their everyday life. For example, there could be more sport lessons in school, more free activities and maybe a whole new subject concerning a healthy lifestyle. In college taking part in a sports course could be obligatory and there could also be more options. Often, at least as problematic as the lack of movement are the eating habits some folks have which is why working on that would also be a great improvement of young people´s health and providing a subject in school about it would be the best way to do it. Still, the sports activities should be fun and not forced but it is important to consider making it obligatory and including it more in school and university.

In my opinion, all of us do need music in our lives. Music can be important in a lot of different situations for different reasons. For instance, some humans are used to listening to music on public transport. In this case, it's entertainment and the music makes the way shorter. For other people, it's a way to put some thoughts into words, and to express them, whether they are of joy, sadness, or of any feeling which the music highlights. It can also be used to celebrate, in clubs, or at more intimate events like a party among friends. We can definitely see that music has a lot of different utilisations. Personally, I can't even imagine life without music. Evidently, I know that some people don't need to listen to music daily and feel very well with that. But globally, music is one of the seven major arts which relies the humans and their culture between them.

When you start learning a language, you are going to find that each language has a certain volume of resources on the internet. Some of them have a small number of resources because they are not that popular, whereas others have a huge number of them, because it is an important language. English is a great example of the second type. If you tried to learn English on your own, you will be confused at first, but I believe that I can help you a little. Writing is considered to be one of the most difficult skills in any language, since it needs correct grammar, punctuation, and a good vocabulary. Another problem you would face is the need for someone to correct your writing, and most of the times that is not available. Write and improve solves many of my writing problems, and the website includes a huge number of writing tasks, divided into three main categories: beginner, intermediate and advanced. After finishing the task, the site will refer to your vocabulary mistakes and major grammar mistakes which is very helpful. The best thing about Write and Improve would be that it gives the English learners a chance to write every day for free. I have been using Write and Improve for months now, at first I practiced the intermediate tasks, but I improved, and now I am writing advanced ones.

The world has changed and plenty of countries are becoming more open. Inexpensive flights allow us to fly all around the world. Tourists and business men have this opportunity, but when they are in different foreign countries, they must be able to exchange with people. Mastering a foreign language like English is essential. Now we have a lot of possibilities to learn a foreign language. You can watch TV to improve your language and also a lot of foreign websites teaching language are available.

Dear town council, I received the information about your idea of banning mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. You are willing to hear our opinion regarding that statement, so here you will hear mine, considering different aspects. Given that, banning mobile phones in public spaces would have such a positive impact in relation to human capability of socializing with each other. Especially in public transportation, why do I think that? Well, nowadays everybody who is travelling alone spends most of their time looking at their screen or are listening to music in order to avoid conversation with anybody around. Its appalling to see how addicted we are to our technological devices. With this idea in mind we could undoubtedly see a change in our behaviour within a short time But if we think about it, banning mobile phones can be an outstanding concept for extroverts, who are likely to begin a conversation with others. Nonetheless for introverts it could sound like the most dreadful idea, some already find it terrifying getting on public transportation but they are able to accomplish it thanks to the phone. On the other hand, banning mobile phones in restaurants will be easier to implement owing to the fact that most of the time you go accompanied. It goes without saying that reducing time on our phones will not only make us realize how nice it is to have a simple conversation with a stranger but also remember how life was before technology. I hope to hear from you soon. Laura Manuela

TV is undoubtedly the thing that has brought the different parts of our society together, and it has made people more conscious about the world in which we live. The TV texture is the same since it has been the same since it appeared over five or six decades ago. This structure has been criticised a lot, because many people have doubts about whether TV tells us the truth. TV should entertain the audience and all those people that watch it, for example, when they are having lunch and dinner. This is the reason why it is easy to watch some programmes like "talk shows" and "quiz shows" where the guests are invited to give their opinions. The power of TV education is something that has already been discussed over the last few decades by well - educated opinionists, and as I see it, TV can be useful to educate the ever - expanding audience that follow its programmes. However, we must point out that the relevance of TV does not depend on only the subject, but also on the manners and education of the opinionists. The most important thing is to pay attention to the cultural level of the cultural level of the opininists, irrespective of the subjects treated.

Music is an indispensable part of our spiritual life, it helps us express emotions. When we are sad or when we feel bored, it can help us feel better. If you feel sad, you can play a happy song or your favourite song, it will affect your emotions, it will make you more positive. Or when you feel happy, you also play your favourite songs, it can help you feel happier, or when you have feelings that are hard to take and you don't want to share them with anyone, you can play songs that match the mood and you can feel less bad. On the other hand, music is a means for musicians and singers to express emotions through its lyrics and melody. In addition, we can see in movies that music also makes a film come alive and makes a film more thrilling, thus attracting a larger audience. So, life without music would be very boring, if life without music would be very boring, lack of emotion,...

Although people think paper books won't be replaced by ebooks, I believe readers will be sharing their time between both of them. Because they are two different experiences. With a book it is a pleasure to touch the paper and feel its grain and its smell. An ebook is very practical, you can bring more than a thousand books with you, you can copy and paste expressions and sentences to make a presentation, you can show this book during a meeting ... all that is very convenient and cheap. But there are also disadvantages. You need to have electricity when your battery is empty. You don't have all books in a digital version. In fact, when you are relaxed and in your library, you like to look for books and take time to see them. Often your eyes are less tired after reading paper books. During those times you usually read a book, but when you are at your office you prefer to use digital ones because it is more practical. I think ebooks must be easier for students to use for preparing lesson But when they research any information from the past, paper books will be unavoidable.

Are you musical? Have you ever thought about how important music is for most people worldwide? How often do they listen to it or why do they listen to it? There are many moments in life in which music is our unique companion. For example, when we travel by car. However, there are also many other situations when we enjoy music together with our friends, our family, or even unknown people at live events such as concerts. Music is important to help us pass the time while we wait for something, to make the most of our free time, to cheer us up when we are a little bit down, or to celebrate when we have a good reason. The sound we listen to and the lyrics of the songs have the power to change our mood, to make us feel lively and energetic or to calm us down. Personally, I can't imagine the world without music. It'd be like a forest with nothing but bare trees. There would be lack of rhythm to make the world go round.

In my opinion, studying music should be an obligation in all schools. I have this opinion because music is not only an art, but also a way to improve the brain's neuronal connections. All around the world there are studies which demonstrate this. Psychologists, doctors, musicians and several other professionals get these same results: studying music is one of the best things to raise the brain's capacity. Music also can help people to socialize. It is very difficult to find someone who does not like some kind of music. Whatever the style of music it is, there is somebody singing. I imagine that music, in fact, is something really good for the brain and for the mind. Best of all is that music is not only a kind of art which almost everybody may learn since childhood. Children almost always like music, singing it, hearing it, or simply appreciating it. That's why I agree with the idea of applying music for all students, whatever their level of learning at schools is. In my city, almost all schools have already introduced this essay in their classes. I am sure that it only has the goal of improving several aspects of the students' lives. I had the happiness of learning music when I was a child. In my school, those classes began when I was 10 years old. Since I started getting involved in this these essay, I have never forgotten how good it was for all my whole life! And since I discovered the amazing world of musics, I have never given it up anymore! So, here goes my suggestion about this essay: Dear teachers, always when you can, teach music to your pupils! For sure, if you can do that, you will all contribute a lot to the complete mental development of many people in the world!

Most people work for the money. If there is a chance to have a higher income when doing the same things, then who will give it up? Nowadays, most medical doctors choose to work in cities rather than work in the rural areas which don’t have enough doctors. It is all because of the differences in incomes. As we can see, some people who live in the rural areas donu2019 t have enough sources of medical. When they need to go to the doctors they have to go a long distance, which is okay when it is not urgent. But what about the urgent times? We are not able to predict all the accidents, and many people have died because they were not able to get their treatment immediately. With that much being said, what is the solution for this problem? Some might say that governments can distribute more fees to the hospitals which operate in rural areas. But I think that does not make sense. the people who live there are absolutely not as many as those who live in the cities, if the government distribute more fees, it might not be fair to the others. Then what should we do? I think that we can improve the transportation there. By shortening the time they have to spend going to the hospitals, the chances that they can get treatment immediately will be higher. At the same time, people who live in the cities won’t feel unbalanced because they can use that transportation too. Apart from the medical problems, there are actually lots more problems in the rural areas like this, and I think our governments should face the problems or not just keep ignoring them. There are lots of solutions actually, and it only depends on whether the government wants to do it or not. The authorities definitely know these solutions, too, but they don’t care because solving these problems cannot bring them much benefit. Even though reality is cruel, and it will take a long time for problems like these to be solved, we will continue to try our best in order to solve the problems.

I think it is still important in a country that doesn't use the English language in its daily routine. There are a lot of books, movies, and other things that you can access if you can understand English. There is a lot of work in the world that require attendance to better understand English language. And if you are a lover of another language or if you really want to understand a language other than English, no matter what your reason is, then the other foreign language is still important to you. Nowadays, we have no device or something that can translate a language that we don't know in a correct and immediate way. If you know many languages, it will help you to access other content that doesn't exist in your own language. No matter what reason others tell us for learning a foreign language, I still think that it is always important to learn another language you aren't familiar with.

No, I think computers and tablets are not completely going to replace books in schools and universities. I think it is quite a bit easier to read a book than read on computers and tablets, especially when you do research and you need to read a lot of books at one time. In my university, there are a lot of books that are very old, when I read these kind of books I think the hard cover versions are better than the digital versions. The important point is if we need to replace books by computers and tablets you need to give them for free. You can't tell students that they need to buy these and not give them money. That is why I think they are hard to replace, especially in this country. This country has no policy to do such things. If we still have a dictatorship government then I can assure you that you won't see the day that education is the primary consideration in this country.

Music is the best thing we can have in our lives. This thing can make us feel better every time. Firstly, when you are sad you listen to music, when you are happy, or mad, you keep listening and that makes you forgot every problem in your head. All the sadness goes away if you listen to the right song. Secondly, if you want to live in another realm, where only happiness exists, you have to listen to music. Even your friends do that, even your parents or your grandparents. Music is a guide in your life. A life without music makes no sense. Every time you listen, you are happy instantly. Do you think that is a good way to live? I think it is the best way. You need to listen every day. Also, music can improve our motivation or can make us more productive. When you learn something or when you want to be more productive you need to listen to orchestral music. That improves all your skills and makes your brain assimilate everything you want.

My favourite season of the year is autumn. Autumn in Japan is the best season for food like sweet potatoes. Autumn is also the season of autumn leaves, which I think is the best season for sightseeing. I love to see the autumn leaves around Tokyo station. I think the autumn leaves lining the road from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace are wonderful. Every autumn, there are a lot of people to see them. Also the moon is big and shiny and very beautiful! The weather is pleasant with around 20 degrees. The air is cool, but the wind is bracing, and the sky is blue. Spring in Japan has a similar climate to autumn. However, spring in Japan is a difficult season for hay fever sufferers because of the high levels of cedar pollen. I wish that the fall lasted longer, but in the past few years it has gotten shorter and shorter. If autumn were longer than now, I would go to travel.

Dear Ivan, My favorite film is Cast Away, with the actor Tom Hanks. I have three reasons. The first reason is that love sometimes is very strange, almost a tragedy. The second reason is we don’t know what the tide will bring us each day, which is true. The final reason is maybe the most painful, we don’t know how to accept the misadventures of life. This is part of the suffering of human beings and their life, but it’s necessary to know when we must accept that. I forgot to tell you, the music and landscape are beautiful. My favorite scene is when Hank made a bonfire. I recommend you should watch it.

To talk about the volunteer work that has to be done to graduate from some high schools, we have to figure out what volunteer work is first. In my opinion, volunteering is working but not for pay. Maybe for learning experiences or just because of their passion. No matter what sets off this decision, volunteering should be good for everyone. But actually, something is going wrong now. Volunteering should be done by people who want to do it. However, some schools set up rules that require students to go volunteering compulsorily. In that case, students do volunteer work with a completely different attitude. They are not really there to help any more, and they just want to finish their jobs as fast as they can. Undoubtedly, most of the quality of their work will not be as good as we expected. It is a difficult problem to solve. If we change the compulsory rules with rewards, the quality will not get higher because most of the students will still finish their work at the lowest requirement. And if we make the lowest requirement higher, their parents will start to argue that it takes too much of their time doing these meaningless things so their kids cannot study well. The best way I think to solve this problem is to cancel the rule that requires students to go volunteering. The students who really want to help will still go by themselves and the others who don’t have that kind of passion will not have to waste their time. There are lots of things that cannot be done well by setting up rules. Many factors have to be considered, whether psychological or not. All is all, this is my opinion about volunteer work.

Motivating children to do regular exercise Today's biggest challenge is in child education and parenting and how to motivate children to do regular exercise. In recent years, the number of doctors reporting children with health problems such as obesity has skyrocketed. The number of young people taking up sport is also ever decreasing. So, schools should provide their students to take sport classes, three times a week. Firstly, most of the time parents are not able to take their offspring to the soccer club or tennis club. They are too busy with their work and come home after dinner has already been served. Undoubtedly, schools are the perfect solution for this, their students could simply stay at school for three extra hours a week and take sport classes. This will help enable children to exercise regularly. Furthermore, it will not cost any extra effort from school or the parents; the students were already in school, so they do not have to be brought or something. Secondly, as already mentioned in the introduction, there is an increasing number of teenagers who suffer from health problems, because of their lack of exercise. They may not be motivated or empowered by their parents, but this is the part where college comes into play. As with the first argument, schools simply need to coerce and motivate their students. This can easily be done by providing their students to be able to take gymnastic classes three times a week. In conclusion, schools should enable their students to participate in sports activities, since there is an ever increasing number of young people who suffer from health issues, because they do less sport. Furthermore, not every child is able to do exercise regularly. Schools could easily help these young people by providing their students to take sports lessons three times a week. Students should not be stupid and drop it.

As a current pediatrician who looks after the health of all kids, I couldn't agree more. During these recent years junk food and gummies have became the most crucial food for kids, and because of the certain amount of restaurants of fast food, this habit of eating unhealthy food has became bigger. Now that there's more technology that surrounds us and that a lot of kids are into video games all the time, the best we can do for children is put sports activities at least 3 times per week, because if they keep having an inactive lifestyle and still eat junk food, the number of problems and illnesses they can have in the present or carry to the future are extensive. I think that the fathers of this kids are not very conscious about the type of life their kids are living with such bad habits of health and food. If parents are worried about their children, they can do some things to avoid the problems that a younger kid can get, like a heart problem, once he's older. Some of the things that I recommend is putting the kid in an extracurricular sport, or if you have the opportunity to do a sport that you can do at school after classes you could choose that option. Doing an extracurricular sport helps the kid to have a more active lifestyle - in addition to the sports activities 3 times per week - and to become more healthy. Although we want children to start having a more active lifestyle, I would also recommend for them to change the type of food they're constantly eating and that isn't healthy for their body; food like juice that has a lot of preservatives and sugar, chocolate that is in almost every cookie you find, etc.

Music was born as a form of communication. Over time, music changed with the abilities and the evolution of communication. Music is a way to promote ideas, to send messages, to fall in love, and to fight against enemies. In my life, music plays a fundamental role. I usually listen to music when I feel alone. Music is a companion of my magic moments. Several songs have a special meaning for me. When I hear those songs, I live special moments of my life in my mind again. Music is an opportunity to meet people and to have new friends. Nothing is as special as attending a live concert. A life without music would be the same as a life without colours. My favourite music is dance music and hip-hop. My mother likes lyrical music and my father likes rock music.

Based on some TV programs, social media and other kinds of entertainment, you should pursue the idea of living an intense life as the most ideal option even when this is something harmful to our own bodies or to other people's feelings. They say it's your obligation to give yourself the best of this world and all its pleasures as well. On the other hand, living a long and calm life is sold as something boring, old-fashioned and even meaningless, which is not the case at all but, as a marketing product that doesn't receive enough attention, this kind of lifestyle seems not good or even wrong. That said, it is clear there is a kind of bias on our platforms of entertainment, aiming at something that can be money, blindness and other shadowed goals. Personally, I would prefer to live a long and calm life rather than an intense and short life because time is something highly precious for me and I do not want to waste it filling emotional needs but, achieving meaningful goals. Aiming to explain in detail those meaningful goals, I'll be more specific now. They are: raising my children with love for the Lord Jesus, learning more and more about Him and consequently improving my personal features. I know that some of those last mentioned are not good and that's why I want to improve them.

My favourite season of the year I do not have a favourite season, I like all four seasons. But it is true that we can enjoy each season in a different way, doing enjoyable activities, both indoors and outdoors. When it comes to having fun, I am very sure that summer is the best season. People can go outside without being afraid of bad weather, storms or facing a pouring rain. There are plenty of activities available, such as playing sports, camping, taking a walk, or even swimming in a river or lake. Being a member of a country club could be a great idea if you have a hot summer season in your region. The summer season is also nice because we can keep in touch with nature. It is a nice time to have ice cream, juices, and tropical fruits, such as banana, papaya, melon and cold watermelon, which is such a delicious fruit.

Human always keep developing every second, that's our instinct. Since our ancestors' era, we've already possessed that feature. Our ancestors had an intense life because that's survival instinct, they had to forage, find a place to sleep and hunt or they would be hunted. Today, some people presume that we don't need to do so anymore as we've got everything we need already (foods, stable accommodation and even places for entertainment) but I don't think so. We're human and humans always want more in a positive way. Personally, it's not wrong as curiosity is good, learning new things is good. I love an intense life more than anything else. That's why if you ask me, I will definitely choose a shorter but much more intense life rather than a long, calm one until 100 years old. As I have said, to keep moving forward is our instinct. I believe that's a special feature God creates especially for humans. Furthermore, I love the intensity of our life. I always think it's the gift which life gives to us. Every time I come up against a challenge or sticky situation, maybe I would feel sad or have some other negative feelings at first, but after that I know it was a positive experience and feel very proud of myself. After all, challenges help us grow. I learn a lot from those hard moments. In summary, I couldn't live even a day with a life that is so calm or monotonous, every day being the same, I prefer an intense but short one.

Life choices In modern society, people can easily live to 100 if they live healthy lives, but most people do not live until they are 100 years old, which means they have chosen not to live wholesomely all the time. Understandably, it is not possible to always think about the future. Firstly, humans are animals, thus they are not so able to think of their happiness in the future, but of their present peace of mind. So, people are not not always able to take bright decisions and there is nothing wrong with that as long as they enjoy their lives. I would rather have a short pleasant life in which I had a lot of fun than a long dull life and live to 100. Secondly, looking back to the first argument, nobody will get happy about living a long wholesome life without any pleasure. Everybody would rather have a shorter life in which they have enjoyed life and they can say: "Wow, my life was awesome man, I do not regret anything," instead of having a dreary life and saying, "Well if I had walked 10 more steps every day, this would not have happened" In conclusion, I would rather have a short, but joyful life than a long but drab life since I will be able to look back at my life on my deathbed and think, "Wow, what an amazing life I had."

The effective room arrangement depends on the jobs that employees usually deal with. But I prefer types of workstations or cubicles because I usually have to focus in my jobs on doing equations or programs to do many cases of simulations if the functions work well or to improve them or to find what the wrong points are. But after doing equations or programs, we have to discuss the results if they match other parts of the product. So we also need open rooms. Considering the above points, our office should be open design to easily ask or discuss something with other colleagues. But it is better we also have a space which has some enclosed stations to focus on our own jobs. Employees must use laptops to easily move to their desks according to the tasks they need to deal with.

My favourite season is winter. It's the best season in my opinion, the cold is better than the heat. This entails that there are fewer people in the street and the world is calmer. There is more rain, which is so relaxing, and one of my leisure activities is reading while it is raining outdoors. It makes me engrossed in the reading a lot. Also, it is the season when there are more events where the family is brought together and there are more ad hoc meals, and the city is lighter than the rest of the year, and the people are happier and they help each other. It's a good time to make a list about your goals for the future and to see all that you have succeeded in during the year. And finally, hanging out with your friends in your house and seeing films or playing board games while drinking and eating is the best way to spend the afternoon.

MY REASON FOR LEARNING ENGLISH The number of reasons why I want to learn English are almost endless, but there is one that has me totally absorbed. English is the most common language in the world, and despite the unrest around the world, I think that a good knowledge of English will let me have a conversation with a large number of people. Although I do not like its grammar and the different ways of making the sentence structures, I must acknowledge that English is an interesting language and it is useful to reinforce our ability in thinking in an alternative way. Also, English has been singled out as the first language for international trade, and all those who take over the control of a company or a firm, have a deep knowledge of it. As I see it, when your level of English is high, you have the authority to manage all the international sides of an issue like politics, economics, or psychological problems. We must not bury our head under the sand, English is the language of the future.

There are four seasons in a year, and each season has different characteristics, so some people will like different seasons compared to some others. Me, I prefer summer. Why? The first reason is I love swimming, especially in hot weather, and summer is the hottest season in the year, which is a convenience. Second, my favourite food is cold and sweet junk food, and it is best to eat cold food in hot weather that makes you sweat. One more very special thing is I don't need to go to school in summer, which makes sense to all students! As I have a summer holiday, of course in summer, I can go swimming and eat ice cream. I can also visit my grandparents and meet my cousins too, which is really fun. I don't know if other people like spring, or fall, or winter, but I like summer the most.

Many people believe that the best holiday is to go to the beach with good shade, but there are many destinations to go on holiday to. According to experts tourist office more than 80% of people prefer to go close to the beach in summer in order to look for relaxation and good food. The problem is that a lot of people think the same, therefore beaches are crowded. My wife and I prefer to stay in contact with nature, far from any crowd. For this reason on our honey moon we decided to go to Costa Rica. It was the best holiday we have ever had in our lives. It is amazing, we were walking through the jungle looking for wild animals. In spite of the animals being dangerous you can see them if you stay quiet. To sum up, it doesn't matter what the place is where you to go, the most important thing is who are you going with.

If you had asked me two years ago what the meaning of music in my life was, I certainly wouldn't have given it the importance that it deserves. Nowadays, two years later (and a Covid-19 pandemic in the middle of it), I can say that music has saved me. When the Covid-19 pandemic started, I needed to move back to live with my parents and keep myself locked up inside our home for safety. It was a really difficult time for me, because I had gotten used to living alone and there was a lot of fear in the air. This episode took more than one year and I needed psychological help to keep me strong until the end. In several moments, music was my only company and distraction. Because of this, I developed a rich taste in music, in particular for different musical styles from around the world, such as reggaeton, pop culture, R&B, Indian music, etc. Now, I'm sure I can't live without music and I'm looking forward to the next Doja Cat album!

There are several reasons to explain the problem. And perhaps it can be very hard to find solutions to it. Why do so many doctors prefer to work in cities where it is possible to earn a lot of money? The answer is there are several reasons, and one can tell some of them: First, those cities with many people are places where there are many more opportunities. If there are many possibilities, there will be much more money, too. Second, with more money in our pocket, it is possible to choose the best conditions of life. And so, things become a circle. Third, perhaps doctors want to work in the richest cities because there are more advanced technologies and research, and also more qualified people to work beside the health professionals. These are only some of the reasons I see for that preference. But, what can we say about the real situation of those people who live in rural areas? In these places, there are not enough medical professionals in the area. So, why don't those doctors want to work there? Well, the poverty is a huge reality. The places where those people have to work are simple and small, and they hardly receive enough research or support to continue doing their activities. In these smaller cities (or districts!), these or that doctor is usually the only professional to work during the weekends. In consequence, a great part of them work much more than they should. Perhaps for this reason many of them prefer to work in places next to great cities. How can it be solved? It is difficult to say that there is only one solution to solve this trouble. In truth, there are several points to be analysed. It is necessary that those little cities' professionals earn better payments. And also, governments have to pay more attention to those people who don't live in the capitals. It is also necessary to improve the structures and conditions of those work places. Perhaps after all these improvements, doctors can change their point of view and they will want to change the largest cities for the calm of the smallest villages!

Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? In my opinion, yes, today it is more important to speak another language, especially English, than to have a professional degree. It’s probably because of many causes, for instance: a) the size of the American economy, b) the international relations between the United States of America and the Commonwealth, c) several free-trade agreements or treaties subscribed by many countries around the world. Another reason maybe can be the American culture. It is fascinating how they have captured the imagination of millions of people of thousands of different cultures, through their music, television programs, movies, and video games. Of course, globalization is a strong influence on the economic relationship between countries, but it depends on the leadership of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Of course, the leadership depends on the advanced technology and military forces.

Medical doctors and cities A great issue faced by many cities is the absence of health care staff, mostly medical doctors, in rural areas. This problem affects both underdeveloped and developed countries. Medical doctors do not want to live in the countryside. But why does it happen? What leads to this situation in several countries, whether these countries are rich or poor? I guess there are several things that can influence it. One of them is that when a highly qualified professional like a doctor lives in big cities they earn more money. In addition, doctors who live in big cities can easily get educational updates such as MBAs, courses and conferences, which would not be possible if they lived in rural areas. Living in major cities can help these doctors make professional connections and this is very important for their careers. Maybe they would not be able to get these opportunities if they lived in the countryside. Despite the difficulty of setting medical doctors in the countryside, there are some possible strategies that towns can adopt in order to attract these professionals. One is to give them tax breaks to set up a new doctor's office. Another possibility is to offer advantages to newly graduated medical students. I saw an interesting alternative here in my country. Medical schools are being set up in medium size cities, known as regional centers, and this has been helping fix young doctors in those areas. Regional retention surveys have shown it is working.

Dear President of the Council: When it comes to improving the lives of all citizens, every decision is important and welcome. Your decision to ban the use of mobile phones in some places is excellent. However, I suggest only changing when it comes to doing it in some places, like shops and restaurants. I will explain why. Banning mobile phones on public transportation will be amazing! On the buses, trains or taxis, people need to respect passengers, and they have to maintain a pleasant place, in the maximum silence possible. Nobody would feel good if they are disturbed by those who don't speak low, don't want to do it, or prefer to listen to loud music. Banning mobile phones in this type of place is an excellent choice! On the other hand, I ask you to reconsider your idea of banning them in shops or restaurants. Think about those people who are working all the time, and the cell phone is their main work tool! They are in permanent contact with clients and several other types of people. They almost always do their tasks during meals, or when they go to a cafe, for example. If people are prohibited from using their mobile phones in restaurants or shops, it may have prejudice in their their work. So, I suggest you think better about the restrictions that this Council intend to apply for all citizens, if it's possible, of course. People will agree with me. And we believe that this, our point of view, if can be accepted, will improve the lives of all people. Thanks for your attention.

The best thing would be mix of two options. Living your life as a rock star or taking care of garden. At my age, I have a wife and two kids, life is more intense than you can imagine. Although it not like a rock star's life. Living your life much more intensely you can fell a lot experiences in a short time, but you won't have time to remember your actions. As well, you can get hurt if you do something like an extreme sport, and you will have to stay in hospital some time of your life. If you think a shorter life is better, your family will miss you for a long time, and you won't have children, because you won't take care of them in the future. On the other hand, if you prefer a long and calm life, you can make a lot of happy experiences many times with your family and friends, despite not having a Youtube channel showing your life but I'm sure that a picture book will be the best memory that you could have. Therefore, you can have an intense life from your desk, because on TV you can live a great experience such as watching a football match or movies. In my opinion, life is always too short and we have to enjoy it a lot because you should think that you can do very intense things and at the same time live a long time with your loved ones.

It goes without saying that when it comes to healthy living, there is a large number of things we can do to maintain it. My thoughts concerning that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would like to point out some paramount actions which should be accomplished by each and every individual who is willing to keep a healthy life. To begin with, drinking at the very least two liters of water every day is something pivotal if we want to get rid of toxic particles. Another issue to have under consideration is the food we eat. I cannot help but mention that we all feel attracted by tasty food. Nevertheless, the meals we rate as tastier are not usually the ones that provide us with the vitamins and appropriate characteristics. Fast food should be avoided as much as possible. Instead, we ought to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables in order to get fit. Nonetheless, we often find ourselves failing in the task of keeping fit, due to the fact that we do not usually count on the required time to fulfil that aim. Nowadays, we live in a deeply stressful world. Last, but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that our body is our most valuable treasure, therefore, it is essential for us to put it in the first place.

Offices workspaces Currently, office workspaces are a very important feature that can influence employee productivity and behavior. Choosing which design best suits the workplace is just as important as hiring the right person to do the job. Enclosed workstations can be very depressing and some people may view these cubicles as a threatening space that can betray their creativity. However, on the other hand an open design office should give the employees an idea that they can do what they want anytime, but just in case they are not familiar with that design. Open design offices have been used in several industries and countries for many years and since they started, they have been working, although it is very important that this kind of office be used in the right way. For example, it is a good idea to use an open design office for marketing, sales, advertising, or other informal businesses. But there are some industries where working in enclosed stations may be necessary, such as accounting offices, law firms and any areas where concentration and silence are an important requirement for the work environment. Perhaps having these two options is such a good idea as it would meet the needs of employees in just one office. I guess it is very common today. Office buildings are being built with these two designs. If employees need it, it will be available.

If I got to choose, I would prefer a long, calm life over a short intensive life. A precondition is I still have friends to spend time with and I am healthy enough to live on my own. One of my greatest pleasures is to read books. I read for hours and imagine living other lives. On the outside it seems calm but, on the inside, I experience an adventure. In addition, I like to learn new skills. For some weeks I have been practising my coding skills. Learning a coding language demands long hours of training. To sum up, I need time in life to follow my interests. A short and intensive life, I imagine, is accompanied with fear of missing out on something. And intensity involves good and bad experiences. I prefer to learn certain lessons in life from books rather than experiencing them. In a short and intense life, I would always be on the run for the next exciting thing. A calm and long life although includes adventures but also more time for reflection. I like the change between lively and calm periods in my life. Yesterday I visited my sister and was thinking about becoming a mother. It is a difficult decision since I cannot reverse it . Right now, I love my life as it is with my boyfriend and feeling loved.

Dear Town Council, I am a normal citizen in this town and I respect your opinion about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. But I have a reversal opinion about this law. I have been a worker in this town for 10 years, I often have to go a long way to work, so I think that I need to buy a phone for necessary situations, but the security on public transport is very low and I must be alert to pickpockets whenever I want to make a call. Therefore, I see calling with public mobile phones is a better choice, I can move to the place where there is a driver and bus attendant and it is quite safe. Second, public mobile phones on transport and in restaurants can support me in an emergency. I sometimes forget my phone at home and I cannot borrow other phones, so public mobile phones are my savior. Finally, the cost of public mobile phone's time is cheaper than private phones, so I can save some money with this. As a laborer, I need to accumulate as much money as I can, because the company only hires young men under 40 and will fire all the old workers when they are not efficient. As you can see, I strongly protest your law. Although there are some problems with public mobile phones like the installation fee, for we must put the phone on many roads, and the nuisance of being bothered by children, we can solve it easily by encouraging people to use it more, and we can teach children not to do this, I think that is more beneficial than banning public phones. In conclusion, public mobile phones are convenient, safe, and more economic than other choices. Sincerely, hang.

Today, there are a lot of music types in the world and the latest polls show us music is indispensable for people because it is the best option to make people happier Life is already miserable and depressing because everybody has problems in their life, and they want to feel happier. And music makes people's life less depressing because when they feel music, they go into a completely different world, which removes their problems, and they feel happier and less depressed. Life is unthinkable without music because if there is no music in the world people will be depressed and sad because there is no option to alleviate their concerns. I think music is a necessity for people's life because there are a lot of concerns in people's life. Music helps people to alleviate their concerns. Moreover, there are a lot of social media platforms which use music on their platforms for fun.

Choosing a university and a course to enroll in is one of the most important decisions in life. Students have to decide it taking into consideration a lot of reasons, among them whether living on their own or with their parents. I personally believe that living by yourself is one of the best choices for a student. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following paragraphs. To begin with, I think is crucial for students to pursue their own independence in this period of life. For a long time before this, college students are living in a comfort zone in their parents' house with food, housing, and clean clothes available. It can make them used to a lifestyle that is not real, and for that reason a period living alone far from home can be really helpful for their development. I am a compelling example of this, the best decision that I made in life was to leave my mother's house to go to college in another state. It helped to develop skills and habits that are useful nowadays. Secondly, living alone provides an opportunity to connect with other people and build lifelong relationships. Moreover, it can also lead to building a powerful network that will be important on a professional level in the future. For instance, when I was living alone in college I made a lot of good friends, they helped me a lot to pass through that new phase and become really close. Furthermore, due to being with me everyday, they became my second family and I can rely on them until this day which definitely comes in hand on a personal and professional level. To conclude, I strongly believe that living on their own is good thing for students. It will help them to grow personally and to build great relationships.

I think music is necessary for everyone. Even if you do not like some styles, I bet that you have a song in your mind that helps or has helped you somehow. When you are sad or happy, your playlist can tell, I am sure. And this is the thing, music has a great impact on our lives. The best romantic song was written because of someone. A person put all their feelings in such a way to express how they felt. And, somehow, when we listen to that song, we think about someone too. Or at least feel something. But why? Because music carries more than lyrics, it carries feelings. Another interesting thing: some studies reported the effects of music on neurological and mental diseases, showing that songs could affect our nervous system and memory. This is an amazing thing for more research about diseases like Alzheimer and dementia. So, somehow, the songs that you like and listen to have a permanent effect on your brain, even though you think about music like a random way to pass the time. And because of that, I am sure that our lives would be harder without the feelings expressed through beautiful lyrics. It would be harder to recharge ourselves with the beauty of melody and composition. Music makes us feel alive.

When talking about university life, the first thing we think of is being independent. Most of the students are of age and it is just the time to face problems by themselves. But, is moving away and living on their own a good choice? Here are some points. The most common problem is money, there has to be a place for university school students to live in, and a place to live by oneself might cost a great amount of money. So where does the money come from? Some families can afford another expenditure like this, but what about the others that cannot afford it? Of course the students can go get a part-time job, but since the college life is very busy, I think it will affect their studying or socializing. As a result, getting a job while learning in school is just putting the cart before the horse. And another problem is about time. When we are in college, there are lots of things to do, no matter the studies or the clubs or the relationships. Those are all very important for the college students and will take a lot of time. So, do they actually have time to do all the housework and do some dishes? In my opinion, they have to learn how to control the use of their time and it is possible to handle everything. So if the family can afford the money for living outside, maybe we should give it a try. Actually, there are many other things to worry about in college life, because it is a big break of life. We start to learn things not only for tests and we start to plan our future, maybe start to feel stressed out but that is just what we have to face.

My favourite season of the year could be no other than winter. When the weather is cold, I feel better, and I will tell you why. When the weather is warm, I feel annoyed. In the summer, my body feels uncomfortable. I can't have good food, I need to drink a lot, a lot of water... when the weather is hot, I cannot sleep very well, and doing sports is a great sacrifice. So, I always welcome winter. Lower temperatures make me smile. When winter comes, I sleep very well. I can eat several delicious things, I do not feel thirsty, and doing sports outside is amazing. While in the summer I have difficulties to wear some clothes, in the winter I can easily use several of them. So, I have all the motives in the world to love winter. During the winter, it is possible to travel to those places where the snow falls. Landscapes become wonderful! When winter arrives, and one is close to a loved person, there is a sensation of love in the air. In the winter, to be by the side of a loved person is simply amazing... I only appreciate the summer if I can walk along the beach. So, if the place where I live doesn't have beaches, I prefer winter, whatever the occasion is.

Most medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money, yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I believe medical practice is based on humanitarian values and medicine is always on the front line in the fight against health catastrophes such as pandemics. However, doctors often want to work in cities where wages are higher than in rural areas, and the reason is that doctors may have spent several years studying medicine, so they want to compensate the years wasted with financial profit from their work. Furthermore, nowadays studying medicine is quite expensive and challenging; hence all of these factors contribute to why doctors would want to earn a lot of money in compensation. In my opinion, this problem can be solved by strengthening the healthcare sector through enhancing the healthcare facilities in rural areas, and increasing the salaries for doctors who wish to practise medicine in rural areas. In addition, we can also encourage doctors to work in rural areas by promoting living conditions in rural areas where doctors can find a suitable environment to live and work in so that they can feel satisfied. On the other hand, in advanced countries rural areas are well equipped with hospitals and medical centres which makes little difference from big cities. However, in developing countries rural areas have a very bad healthcare system compared to cities and that is what makes most doctors in developing countries prefer working in cities instead. Finally, strengthening the healthcare system and promoting the living conditions in rural areas can bring about a hope for many doctors to practise medicine in rural areas.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion, it is a good thing because students at this level of education need to engage themselves in volunteer work in order to understand the meaning of humanity, collaboration and sense of collective work by which they can build their character and self-confidence. In addition to that, volunteer work inspires young people to learn about social responsibility; and I think that's how we build our communities. On top of that, doing volunteer work as a compulsory requirement for graduation can be compelling for some people and not for some others, but I believe it is a good thing. Moreover, through volunteer work , high school students can learn valuable skills that will help them gain work experience. Working as a volunteer would help students to develop their inter-personal skills; because they will work in an environment that brings together people from different backgrounds and expertise; so it is a really amazing opportunity for students to explore the world of volunteer work!

I live at home with my family and I commute to school every day. I actually like this. You can learn while travelling, listen to music - it is quite relaxing, before or after the whole day. It is just a 20-minute-long journey so it is not too far away. I like living with my family as there is always someone at home, and you are not alone for all the household stuff and you have time to study and so on. But I am also happy when nobody is at home as well. Then I can relax or study without being bothered. However I am an adult and I can handle all my studying alone. But some students are not responsible and self-disciplined enough to look after themselves and their studying. Then it is definitely not convenient for them to live alone while studying. I think that those students tend to be more rebellious and less responsible with their learning. But it is not always possible for students to live at home while studying because they might not live close to their school and they would have to commute far away to their school. Then students should be very self-disciplined and keep in touch with their parents to be controlled. I personally prefer living with my family but I think I could handle living on my own as well.

When I was in the elementary school, I used to have music classes once a week. Honestly, I wasn't the most dedicated student in the class neither the best one. It might seem that I didn't like this class, but even if it wasn't on my favorite classes list I'm a pretty defensor defender of musical education in schools. As with physical education, the musical education provides a complex group of skills that can be developed along the years, like keeping concentration, motor coordination and patience. Furthermore, this kind of class shows the students the cultural variety of rhythms around the word. Knowing this, the student can get to know about other subjects, such as history, geography and literature. When the students grow up, they become more independent and their youth requires them make new friendships. Music classes might help them to make a band with their friends or people who they have never met before. In addition, at difficult moments, like the end of the high school, the capacity of playing an instrument can bed them and make that moment easier to go through. Thus, I only see pros when the subject is having music classes at school or not. Even not being a musician nowadays, I can't live without music and I'm grateful to my music classes for showing me this adorable world.

I'm a fan of animated action films, a combination of animated films and action films. These films are interesting, and we can watch them at all ages. Of all those films, my favourite film is "Wreck It Ralph 2." It's about a man called Ralph and a little girl named Vanellope von Sweetz who travel in the world of the Internet. Both of them are game characters in the arcade and they are friends, and that is strange because they are from different games. But this film is very long, so I can't tell you everything now. " Wreck It Ralph 2" is really fascinating and meaningful. You should watch it, so you can imagine how the Internet world works and understand the meaning of friendship.

My favourite season of the year is winter. I think it is quite obvious if you live in a country that is hot as hell like mine, you will love the winter season. Although, in this country winter is as not cold as I thought winter should be, but it will be good to have some cold out there in the street. But I think the weather is hotter than before and I think maybe in 50 year time the temperature in the winter season of that year will equal the temperature in the summer of this year. I think all around the world the temperature is getting hotter. This is a serious situation. We all need to solve this problem quickly if we don't want to destroy our world. We need to reduce the temperature as fast as possible. I want to encourage all of you to reconsider when you do something that harms our world, such as establishing a company that exploits workers and does harm to our world.

Apart from that, you don't need to prepare anything as I will buy all of the ingredients. See you tomorrow, Best wishes,

In my opinion, nobody should be forced to do anything they don't want. One thing is very important: good habits need to be part of each person's life, no matter how they live, no matter how old they are. So, they'll begin to have a healthy life. Nowadays, it's obvious that so many people are not afraid for their health. A considerable number of people have acquired bad habits, which include eating fast food, processed foods, not going to the gym, low daily portions of water, etc. and all this is enough to make people have a bad quality of life. It's absolutely necessary to put inside the head of each human being that it is very important to care about the body. Mental, psychological and physical health. I think that it will not be a recommendable thing to force all university students and school children to do sports activities 3 or more times per week. More than to force them to act this way, it is important to show them how a good lifestyle can contribute to raising the level of productivity of everything in daily life. Will a professional or academic life be better? Of course, but not only that! By maintaining good daily habits, several areas of life also will improve. When we put together good food, sports, inter relationships, smoking abstinence, alcohol consumption control and many other things we must do to have a pleasant life, it's possible to live during much more time with good health. So, I think that it is not necessary (and it is not pleasant, too) to force somebody to do something that they don't want. Life always shows us that on many occasions, when we try to apply some habits in people when they don't like them, the results are not too good. After a period of time, some of these people usually practise old bad habits again. So, all their hard work will have been lost. It's better to bring solid, good argumentation, which will make people re-think their habits, and, so, they will be able to change themselves in a voluntary way.

They say music and mathematics are the languages of the universe. Everyone in the universe is supposed to understand the languages of mathematics and music. Despite having the same root, they have some differences. Math is essentially reasoning, whereas music means poetry, inspiration, and art. We need poetry and beauty in our, sometimes, grey life. Music is essential for our leisure, concentration, for remembering good moments, for inspiration for work, and for forgetting, for instance, some problems. It can recharge our energy with hope and inspiration to search for solutions for many problems. Music is important for our life. For children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Without music it would be impossible to dance and to provide action and feelings in films. I think life would be impossible without music. Even primitive civilizations compose music to celebrate peace and victory, to enjoy leisure time, and to offer a gift to God.

Although a majority of people like the summer season, when all people are on the French south coast, I prefer the winter season when the weather is bad in France, and you can fly to exotic countries where the temperature of the water is cool with a beautiful sun. I like this season because it is quite calm in these foreign countries. I prefer working during the summer season in France when there are a lot of people to buy my products in the south of France. I think that it is a better solution for me because I won't be on holidays surrounded by a lot of people and have a lot of traffic jams. For me holidays must be in a quiet place where there are few people. For example, this year I will fly to Venezuela in the month of February.

Dear council, I am writing to express my disagreement with the current idea that is being thought to be implemented regarding the usage of mobile devices on public transport and more facilities. In the first place and above all, using electronic devices in the previously mentioned places does not affect anyone in a negative way, in fact, people that take public transport for work or education displacement often use it for helpful purposes or entertainment, which should be taken into consideration as well since some trips can be long and dull. Furthermore, regarding shops and restaurants, people using electronic devices can be anything but harmful or disrespectful. For instance, people taking pictures of their meals or clothes could attract customers or advertise these places in some way, which in light of shop and restaurant's owners will not be seen as something needed to be banned. Last but not least, I would like to mention too that the attempt of preventing people of using theses devices, might only make the situation well worse due to the fact that people may rebel against it, it would be needed to implement new regulations and punishments... And if we balance the consequences, and considering that it is not one of the pressing issues in our city, the efficiency of this change may be sparse at best. I just desired to express my opinion and foremost help with the problem. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can offer aid with anything. I hope it was relevant information. Yours sincerely.

Some activities requested by schools from their students in order to graduate are very important because it introduces some values to students, and more, depending where these students are studying they would have a chance to interact with their community or do something relevant to contribute to their cycle. However, the way that it is presented and requested to students is not the best way to do that. Broadly speaking, I think schools that apply this philosophy to their educational system should think of another approach to justifying and motivating students to create and develop this sense of responsibility towards their community. Despite being considered a requirement in some schools, that is, this activity is mandatory, there are other ways to teach these values and their importance. A great example of this is extra curricular activities where students immerse themselves in the aspects that are proposed to them. I could list some of them here, to begin with students living with other family, for instance, on a farm or in a fishing area, and them helping these families with their daily tasks. Second, students can spend a few days helping out in parks designed to preserve forests and natural wildlife. It is possible to enumerate lots of different activities, whereas it is not necessary, because the idea here is the same, it only shows that are another possibilities to show students that volunteer work matters, even when it is not a requirement. So, to wrap it all up, I strongly recommend students and people in general do volunteer work. As a result of that effort we can experience a better environment.

Nowadays, video games are very popular among children. These games are very interesting. As a result, many children become addicted to them.,. some parents believe that these games can have a negative impact on their children. On the other hand, other parents think that they may have some positive effects. As for me, I don't think they may have good effects. There are many reasons why I say this. If children play the games, they have to sit for the whole day because these games are interesting. So, they don't want to stop anymore. It is not good for their eyes and their health. In addition, when they are playing games, they forget everything, like eating, drinking and sleeping regularly. In the long run, there may have many bad things on them. Moreover, if they play games all the time, they don't want to do anything else. For example, to help their parents, to do their lessons regularly, or to communicate with other friends. Therefore, I agree that playing games can have a lot of negative impacts on children. Thus, parents should control their children before they become addicted to the games.

Some people think that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. On the other hand, other people think that animals should live according to their nature. So, it is not good to keep them in zoos. However, different people have different point of views. I don't want to judge exactly which one is right or wrong. However, to be honest, I think that it is better to keep animals in zoos. There are many reasons why I say this. In doing so, the animals don't need to worry about their meals because people feed them regularly. Moreover, they can stay there for their whole life without any dangers. In addition, they don't need to worry about their health because doctors come and take care of them very often. And then, some people who come to the zoos feed them because they love them. Maybe some people will say it is not their nature and they should live freely in the forests. It might be true, but it is not safe for them because of hunters. Thus, zoos are the best place for animals.

There are many advantages to studying abroad. Students can have new experiences, learn about new cultures, and can get a lot of friends from different countries. Moreover, it is exciting and challenging because they keep in touch with different people. So, they can share their experience with their peers and they learn learn different things from them. In addition, they can improve communication skills by studying in foreign countries. And then, they are away from their parents, so they have to do everything by themselves. It helps to improve their skills. However, living in other countries might cost a lot in comparison with your native town. And they can have difficulties to communicate with the other people with different cultures. Another thing is that they may be homesick when they are away from their home. If they are ill, there isn't anyone besides them. So they might be lonely. To sum up, there are both good points and bad points of studying in other countries.

Sport is, with no doubt, essential for everyone, both for young and older people. Especially for students, doing a sports activity is very important because it allows them to be distracted from long hours of study and to free the body from accumulated stress. Students spend lots of time sitting in a class listening to professors or sitting in their own rooms or libraries studying or writing. Therefore, they need to move, not only in order to stay fit, but also to recharge themselves and gain the necessary energy to face the day. Lots of high-school and university students may think that training make them lose time they could use to study or to relax, by hanging out with friends or watching television. Anyway, watching a TV series, for example, does not help them to disconnect their mind and recharge their energy, it simply gives them the impression of relaxing, which is important but not so beneficial as training. Regarding younger students, such as those who attend primary or middle school, I think parents should make them understand the importance of sport, but without imposing on them something they don't like. Every child should be free to choose the sport he or she most likes and feels comfortable with. Going to the gym, attending fitness courses, doing a team or an individual sport, instead, helps them stay fit while having fun and in many cases also make friends. Despite the temporary fatigue, both the body and the mind will benefit from that. They can sleep better, they can study better, they can have, in short, the necessary energy to face a normal weekday. For this reason, many schools and universities are thinking of forcing students to do sports activities. Even though it might seem too much, I think it is the right choice. Students, however, have to be free to choose the kind of activity that most suits them in order not to feel discomfort.

Really, music is not important in our lives. In the first place, just to take this more seriously, we don't need music to eat, to think, or to drive to our jobs, but all our daily chores are more pleasant with it. Moreover, music can change our perception of time and it builds a connection that we made in the past. For example, don't you ever have a random thought with some music and suddenly you remember a situation very clearly? If the answer to that question is yes, you must thank the music. On top of that, music can change our feelings, recently researchers have discovered that music affects behavior and society. This is explained by harmony, because anyone can sense that harmony and understand it in different ways, thus being able to become more aggressive or calm, and it differs from one person to another.

In my country, there are just two seasons, summer and winter, and my favorite season is summer because the climate is really hot and you can go anywhere without being concerned about rain. The other reason is because I like to go to the beach and enjoy sunny days. When it is winter in my country, people must use their umbrella and it is a little uncomfortable to go anywhere with this kind of thing. Another thing that I don't like about winter is that you can feel the days are boring and sad because the clouds are grey and you can feel a little depressed. We just have two seasons, but I would like to have the experience of what autumn is like. I would like to see how the trees change their colors and how their leaves fall. On the other hand, I would also like to see the snow in winter, I'd like to practise some sports, like snowboarding and the like. Maybe I can go to another country and can experience these seasons.

Mobiles phones have become very important in our day-to-day life, and we use them very often to communicate with our family, friends and co-workers. I cannot imagine if people can give up using mobile phones one day, because every aspect of our lives has become connected with the use of phones. In spite of that, phone calls on public transport, and in shops and restaurants can be very disturbing to people around us especially at these places when people need some quiet. I guess banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants may not be the solution and it could be quite a strict decision if the town council plans to apply it; because simply people find it hard to comply with such law. What I claim to be the solution is raising awareness about how much disturbance and harm could be caused if we use mobile phones in public transport, shops and restaurants. Awareness programmes could include attention signboards and may even TV programs or videos on the internet to educate people about the proper way to use phone calls in public. People sometimes have to make phone calls to ask for help or an opinion about what to buy in shops or what to eat in a restaurant. Finally, technology in phones has made lives easier more than ever before through instant communication with our beloved ones, so it is very difficult to ban using it in public places, but we can always encourage people to be keep quiet when using phones in public places.

Since it was created, music has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. People sing when they are happy, exhausted, or depressed. They listen to music because it can release their pain or bring some new ideas to their projects. Music is being used as a way to convey our emotions, it boosts our confidence, removes tension, brings everyone closer, and removes the gap between people. Since people have had wisdom, music has been created in some tribes as a way to celebrate a special occasion and give chances to youngsters to make friends with others, and now it is representing the culture of one country. In my opinion, music makes me feel love, gives me a space to improve my imagination, and scientists have proved that music makes us be more focussed. It is unimaginable how the earth would be without music. Humans will suffer from mental illness, it will reduce the efficiency of creativity or innovation, work will become monotonous without melody or the usual sounds, and people might be less friendly and hate to communicate. So we need to protect and develop music.

Exercise is important for our health. If we are unhealthy, we won't get a healthy and happy life. Therefore, we should take time at least 5 or 6 hours a week for taking exercise. We can get a lot of advantages by taking exercise. It keeps our body fit and healthy. Moreover, it is good for our circulatory system. So, we should take exercise regularly because there are many good things, as I mentioned. If we are unhealthy, our life will not be valuable. For example, we can't do anything, such as work, can't give time to our family, and will be unhappy too. However, if we are healthy, we can do everything as we wish. So, health is very important for everything. And we should take care of ourselves. I think that taking exercise is more important than other things. To sum up, we should take exercise daily, even though we are busy. Because it is very important.

Although people like to talk with these co-workers , I prefer working in a room alone. I find working in a cubicle convenient because I don't have the noise of my neighbour that deconcentrante you me when I need to reflect or I am on the phone with a customer. Also you don't have privacy when you must phone about a private subject. Today there are a lot of open spaces to be able to manage your employees easily. That is between the management and the control of your employees. There are already problems between managers and employees about this type of organization of the work. More and more employees ask for a private area to be able to phone for a private reason, also to manage a small meeting on a web conference or with co-workers. That is also important for the quality of life and the need to concentrate on your work. Teleworking shows the necessity to have a dedicated place to work at home and at the office. Today with digital work, control of the work is easier and does not need to be in the same area. All of these reasons are in favor of the privacy of each co-worker and when it is possible to each have their own office.

Travel will be more and more different in the future. Because technology is developing with time. It helps people to save time too. Technology impacts on our daily lives, including travelling. Long long ago, people rode bicycles, carts, and so on when they were travelling. Therefore, they had to take time when they travelled from one place to another. In the Middle Ages, people used cars, buses, bikes when they travelled. Nowadays, there are many choices for travel, such as subways, planes, and public transportation. So, it is easy and saves time too. Maybe there will be more developments in the future. I don't know exactly how to improve it quickly. But, I think it will be better than today. Moreover, I think that using public transportation will be the same as usual. Because many people can't afford to buy their own. So, they will be still using it.

In my opinion, music is one of the most important things in our lives. Music can connect people. Its power we see in history, for example, in the First World War, where the enemy soldiers had a small period of peace on Christmas Eve. Generally, music can be used for treatment and as an aid for psychical problems, etc. Music is able to change our moods. It can bring joy to our lives. I think that without music our lives are sad, dark, and without hope. Music can help us to discover or find our limits. The limits in our mind, but it can also help us to overcome our physical limits. Music is a very important part of our lives, because it is the way we can show our feelings, sadness, and last but not least, our joy. We have to help our children to express their feelings through music.

Most of the time that I listen to music is while driving a car. I turn the radio on any time I am in the car. When I listen to pop songs, I feel like infomations are updated. I did not listen to music for a while when I was occupied with things, especially buying a home or preparing taxes. I was caught up with collecting information from the internet. I could not afford to listen to music. Even though I was listening to music all the time as if I did not recognized my colllegue talked to me, when I worked for a game developer.

If someone could choose and plan their life, I think many would. Choosing between a short intense or a long relaxed life would be a hard decision. Living a short but intensive life would be a good choice for many people because you could do activities like sky diving or climbing Mount Everest. You could not experience getting old or probably sick which often happens when people get old. Nevertheless, living a long life would mean you have a lot of time. You can plan your life just like your upcoming years and what you want to achieve. Personally, I would live a long relaxed life. I would like to spend a lot of my time with my family, finding the love of my life and spending many years with them would be my life time goal. I would want to study, find a good place to work and build my own house which often takes a lot of time. I would want to watch my children grow up and see them finding love, struggle with life and develop a career if they want to. I would love to meet my grandchildren and see how they cope with life. I am a very calm person and I like to chill on the couch watching a good film. If I had the chance, I would do this my whole long life.

I think music is important in our lives, because we can relax with it. I think music moves some frequency in our mind and that helps us to relax, or it helps us to feel good in our day to day. There are a variety of sounds or types of music, for example, there is classical music. This music is very beautiful because it uses different instruments and with it we feel very relaxed and we can focus on our work. There is also rock and heavy rock, this type of music uses different rhythms. There are scientific studies that say that rock music helps us to be in a good mood, however, if there wasn't music maybe we would be frustrated and maybe we could be angry with people. I think music has always existed since our ancestors, they made music to give thanks to their gods. Besides, they danced because they were happy. So music has always been very important throughout history.

Volunteer work is a basis of our society. That is part of human attitude, to be able to help other people. For this reason it is very important to teach students to improve their ability to help somebody by becoming a volunteer worker. That is so important for young people because in general they don't pay attention to one another. They are young and often self-centered. That project helps students to meet people without interest. They must take time to listen to people who have perhaps another vision or character. They learn how to negotiate and also to talk with people. This exercise is essential to practise soft skills. This skill is the most important part in your work. In their future work they must have the ability to interact with other people without aggressiveness. You must try to understand people in front of you. In this situation you will be able to build together a project for their future company. Volunteer work is essential for a student.

Music is needed in our lives, music has been giving us happiness and sadness. Even many artists have been making music and it has been the best inspiration for people. We have always listened to different types of music. There are even some that are medicinal, some have made me sleep better. Or some even influence our environment because people are influenced by it. Music can make us feel pleasure when we listen to it, also in some moments it can make us remember difficult times that we have lived, or it can also make us remember things that we have forgotten. While we are stressed, not listening to music makes us feel bad. However, if we listen to a pleasant song, it releases substances in our body that help improve our mood. I have listened to music while I work or when I want to be happy, even when I had trouble with my wife. And I sometimes like to learn about some themes because I know they have appeared in many types of music. Some of them were very famous and beautiful and others were horrible.

MUSIC: ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS IN LIFE If you have ever thought that we do not need music in our lives, I cannot help but say that you are absolutely wrong. For better or worse, we all need some artistic forms of expression to let our feelings go, and music is one of the most powerful ones, without doubt whatsoever. Unbelievable though it may seem, music is something essential for me. I would even assure you that I could not feel free without it as I am a singer and through music, I manage to express my feelings. Had it not been for the fact that I became a mother very early, I would have dedicated my entire career to music. Nowadays, it is just a job that I do from time to time, but not a full-time job, as I wanted it to be. That being said, I would also like to mention some other benefits music has, especially concerning mental health. Somehow, music connects with some parts of our brain, making us experiment with sensations. Maybe it is that power that makes music be used as a mental therapy as well. In a nutshell, artistic expressions are significant and pivotal for us as individuals as they play an extremely significant role in our existence.

Capitalism is the main reason behind this situation. People often want to work in places where they earn more money to support a better standard of life. The intervention of the government into the economy could be justified. After all this an externality and government could provide an incentive for working in these areas to solve the problem. Maybe a better salary or social benefit could be a good response. This could bring more doctors to rural areas and make a call effect. Incentives are always a good tool. Developing good services and cultural life in rural areas may be a good idea as well. Sometimes, doctors doesn't want to live far from the city because they do not find big opportunities for developing a professional career or maybe it is difficult to find a great work-life balance. There is no magic response but the key could be in the incentives. After all, people's response is linked by their own interests.

It is usually the case that many of us lie on a daily basis, without even acknowledging this fact. It seems to be a habit we have formed during our everyday conversations. This specific issue piqued my interest, therefore this paper shall contain my personal opinions on this matter. Undoubtedly, we perceive lies as a token of unreliability and untrustworthiness. Lies, once exposed, can make us feel anxious and tense. In worse cases, it may result in serious losses. Yet eventually, something called "white lies" appeared in our lives. A so-called white lie is when someone lies for good reasons. It could be lying about the death of your family member, about someone being in serious health conditions etc. I understand where they are coming from, however, I quite condemn lying in general. If I were to explain my point further, I'd put it like this - I find it disturbing to not know about something I'm supposed to. Then again, I'm not saying that I'm completely innocent. To be honest, white lies are especially unbearable. I'd rather know about my family's losses and cry about it than not know about it at all! I believe many people think alike, but nevertheless, this is a habit so hard to adjust to most of us can barely do it. Perhaps, this world was meant to have lies to be complete. To wrap things up, I don't appreciate lies, but as long as we don't manipulate this power, we could still live harmoniously with their existence!

In my personal opinion, I do think that it would be more beneficial to have more than one teacher each year. The reason for this is that every person is different, and learns more effectively in different ways, meaning that more variety of teachers would be a better option. On the other hand, it is a good point to have the same teacher following and mentoring a student. The advantage is that this specific teacher would know the students weaknesses and strengths better, being able to help in a more personalised way. I guess the more beneficial way to solve this problem would be the option of having different teachers, but all of them should follow the students for more than a year, ideally, for the whole school period. But again, there's no right or wrong, it depends on the student. This question was very tricky. Before asking that, why not get to know the students better and make an analysis to find out which way each one of them would learn better?

In recent years, the active lifestyle of young people has sharply decreased. It is proven that moving your body and doing sports activities often leads to a long healthy life. The main question is if students and school children should be forced to do sports at least three times a week. In order to keep everyone healthy, activities are needed. The body needs different movements to stay fit and active. Many studies show that movement and flexibility decrease with age. Therefore older people should do fitness every other day. On the other hand, newer studies have found out that young people are losing their fitness and flexibility rapidly. This often correlates with playing video games or studying all day. With this information sport activities should be included in school and universities so that young people learn how to move their body in order to build and strengthen the right muscles so they do not get a bad posture for example. However, if something is forced upon you, you do not participate with enthusiasm or give up completely. A good idea would be to offer many different kinds of activities. Many school children like to play football. Other young people like to dance or run. Universities and schools should give their students three hours a week to do sports but should not force them to do anything specific. On some days one feels like going swimming or jogging and on other days they only want to stretch and do some yoga. It is important for schools and universities to listen to their pupils. When I was young I was forced to do specific sports and I did not like them. Now that I am at university and am not forced to do anything I really enjoy doing and trying out new things. I think this would work for many other young people, too, if they get the chance to try out different sports.

Working as a volunteer teaches people to be more tolerant and sensitive to one's needs and feelings. I believe that any amount of volunteer work contributes to young people's development as sympathetic human beings. Requiring volunteer work in high schools encourages students to give something back to the world. For instance, having to do this kind of work involves needing to learn how to better manage their time, alternating their studies with their leisure activities and with being a volunteer for an organisation. If at first it seems a little unorthodox to make it mandatory for students to do volunteer work in order to graduate, they must not see it this way. It represents a way of learning to communicate with other people from different social situations, thus developing oneself. Moreover, socialising with them, sharing stories and feelings, can evolve into meaningful relationships and not a burden students have to carry just to graduate. All things considered, requiring a reasonable amount of volunteer work to be done so students can graduate is a good way of teaching them some of the most important moral values of humanity.

Maybe the schools will be as usual. However, people will use technical aids more widely in the future. So, everything will finish quickly and it can save time too. In doing so, the schools can run more smoothly.

Dear Sir/Madam, First of all, I personally think it is unreasonable to ban the use of mobile phones in public. Here are the reasons: Firstly, we live in an era of globalization now; the popularity of using smartphones is one of the biggest signs of globalization. Today, every social activity is replied on the smartphone, and banning them sounds like rejecting the acceptance of the development of modern technology. Secondly, smartphones can make colossal contributions to the town's quality of life. For example, if someone takes pictures of the local landscape or local restaurants, and uploads them on social media like Instagram, this may help to attract more tourists to come. In this case, the economy of the town will be increased, and this money can be used for the development of the town, such as upgrading the infrastructure. The power of the media is huge nowadays, using them wisely can bring unexpected benefits. Thirdly, such a policy may diminish the town's reputation not only for locals but also for tourists. Locals would think this policy is ill-advised; they will either protest or leave the town. The tourists would think this policy is irrational, therefore the number of tourists will decrease. At this point, none of the situations mentioned above are good for the development of the town. In conclusion, I think banning smartphones is unreasonable in all aspects.

Before discussing this problem, we have to look at the function of truth first. Truth is the result of an explanation of an event; people use the truth to figure out puzzles or questions. But sometimes the truth is cruel; for example, it would be merciless to tell an 80-year-old patient that he will die soon. At this point, a lie or a white lie could make him feel more comfortable. My opinion is that truth and some white lies can make the world a better place. According to my own experience, one of my neighbours got divorced a couple of years ago. But they didn't tell their children the fact of their divorce; they told them that they were separated for only a few months instead. This kind of white lie would make it more acceptable for children than telling them straight about every detail about their parents' divorce. Another example is my friend's grandfather, who died 2 years ago. When he got cancer, he was 82 years ago, the doctor didn't tell him the fact, but he told my friend's parents because the doctor thought it would be too ruthless to inform an 82-year-old man that his life was about to end. My friend and his family spent a great deal of time with his grandpa and cherished his last period of time in the world. In the end, this old man died in happiness and without knowing the fact that he had cancer. Again, in this case, lies are more appropriate than facts. Because sometimes the truth is harmful and unacceptable, lies will make life easier at some points. In conclusion, lies sometimes can beauty this merciless world more than a cold - blooded truth.

Music has become a part of my life. When I look back on my life, music has always been there. When I was little, my mother always played records. I naturally became familiar with the classical music that my mother liked. When I was in my school years, I learned to play the piano. Doing exercises for the piano every day helped me in many ways besides playing the piano. I even played the trumpet in the school brass band. I experienced the joy of playing in an ensemble, which is different from playing solo. Now, I teach playing the piano to my children. I hope that I can share some of my experiences with them. For me, music is always there, like air or water. No matter whether I had a happy day or a bad day, I always kept playing the piano. Perhaps the time playing the piano was a time to face myself. Without music, most of my life experiences would not have been available. I cannot imagine my life without music. Even now, my son is practising the piano beside me.

Since the beginning of time people have used music as a way to reflect their feelings, the complexity of it classifying it as one of the finest arts. Nowadays, most young people believe understanding and learning to play a musical instrument requires a great talent thus refusing to do it of fear they might not possess the ability. To my mind, students should be encouraged to take up music classes in schools. The fact that some schools do not offer music classes at all, not even by choice, may be a result of one of the most common misconceptions: that music is for talented people. However, numerous scientific discoveries have contradicted this idea, demonstrating how studying music enhances the human brain's logical and mathematical thinking ability. This is the main reason why all students should study music in schools. To add more to the idea, learning to play a musical instrument may prove beneficial in developing young people's social skills. Acquiring the ability to play a melody develops one's receptivity towards their own feelings, helping them to better understand and manage their emotions. By accomplishing this, students will also be able to sympathise with other people and deal with situations they might encounter. This represents another important reason to study music in school. All things considered, students should definitely be given the opportunity to study music in schools, leaving aside the benefits, it can be very enjoyable to be able to make music that can emotionalize other people.

The topic that we are going to consider today is, 'What do we think about zoos, animals in cages, and animal parks...?' I personally believe that everybody likes animals, however, we have to analyse what the best way is to watch them. When I was a child spending a day at the zoo was something incredible. It was an amazing day, you were running from one site to another to be the first one to watch the monkeys, lions, or zebras with your face stuck to the glass or hanging around the cage. But when I grew up, I realized that perhaps it wasn't the right place for the animals because they looked like sad and old... they didn't have enough space to move around. Nowadays, we can find others locations where these wild animals aren't locked up, where they can run free and share different spaces with others species in a more natural environment.

Before answering this question, we have to look at the reason why university students and schoolchildren stop doing sports. There are two main reasons, either they don't have time for sports or are too lazy. However, the difference in conditions of countries can be an influencing factor too because children have different school times in different countries. In some countries like China, Chinese students have no time and energy for sports. They live under a huge learning pressure where most of their time is taken in learning time and homework time. According to analyses, the average sleeping time for Chinese students is 6 hours, which means they won't be able to have any free time for sports. If the government insists on asking school children to do sports at least 3 times per week, it will bring nothing but pain and stress to students. But school children in the western world have plenty of free time after school. At this point, I would suggest the government set up some PE lessons, so kids can do sports at school. I personally think that all university students should at least do some sports 1 or 2 times per week because they are already adults, which means they could manage the time between studying and working out. And in the adult world, I believe that a muscular body can boost your sex appeal and makes you look more attractive, regardless of gender. Nevertheless, although doing sports can not only build a prettier body figure, it also can lead people to a healthy life. But it doesn't mean students should be forced to do something; doing sports should be spontaneous. Because if the government force students to do sports, then they probably won't enjoy it, on the contrary, they might start hating it. In conclusion, although the idea of asking students to do sports is brilliant, but it can't be forced.

Many people say that the purpose of television is to entertain, but there are many more things than entertainment. Actually, television can be there to entertain, to educate, and to give information. They are three main purposes of television programs. In fact, people watch television for entertainment and information. Because they want to keep in touch with the world with time by watching television. On top of that, they can watch the weather forecast, movies, series, plays, international news and local news, health programs, live shows, and talk shows on TV. Therefore, television is not only for entertainment and pleasure but also to educate. In addition, I totally agree that it can also educate people. If you always watch movies on TV, you are just watching it for your pleasure. However, if you watch all the things on TV, I am sure that you will get useful knowledge from it.

If you want to know my honest opinion about the existence of music in our life, I say I believe that music is one of the most important and necessary things in our lives. Music has undeniable effects on our soul and our mood, and with music we become extremely happy or sad. And to my way of thinking, life without music can be very boring and passionless because music might improve our passion for life. So, based on these reasons music is very important in our life because it affects our passion or mood directly, and it can be inspiring. If we use music efficiently, we can improve the level of our mental health. Besides, scientists have proven that music has direct effects on the neurons of the brain. For example, if you listen to Bach's music you might solve physics problems better than before. Finally, we should use music in our lives and the benefits of music for our mental health.

I think that at some point music plays one of the most important roles in our lives. At first, suitable music played in the proper situation brings out our emotions. For example, if imposing music is played during an emotional scene of a movie, we are touched deeply. But if graceful music is played during a battle scene, we feel it is strange. Next, we can give some messages to someone by using music. Some write a message of love to someone and others express their feelings through music. That is such an effective means to pass messages that we receive them clearly or seriously. Finally, if there were no music, our lives would be extremely boring. Music enables us to forget bad things. That's why the world without music would be stressful. Thanks to music, we can now live happily. In conclusion, music is an essential element of our lives.

Hello. Regarding this subject I want to tell you that I like to sleep with the light off. Most of the time I let a little light open from the bathroom and that's it. I can't sleep well when I have a big light in my eyes. Regarding the noise problem sometimes I can't sleep if it's noisy. For example, if the TV is to loud I can't fall asleep. I think the best way to sleep is to be relaxed.

As I am not a parent myself, I can't really say in practise what the effects are on children playing video games. To begin with, I was a child who used to play a lot of video games. That's one of the main reasons why I got interested in studying English. Also, depending on the game we can learn a lot of logic, and even some geometry. I guess, playing a lot of video games had an impact on my levels of concentration when I was a kid. So I would say that there's a trade-off, maybe we should allow children to play, but there has to be a limit, and prioritising other activities, such as sports, reading, and social networking. Why not provide some educative games? It could turn the learning process into something fun, keeping the kids studying, and having fun at the same time. I guess that would be the best approach, and less painful for both parents and children. For most of our problems in life, balance is always the key to solving them.

Music is an important part of my life. If I think about it, every important moment in my life, music has been there. Music can sometimes translate what I can't express with my own words. It describes how I am feeling or what I am thinking. Music also creates a mood in certain situations. When I am working, for example, I like to hear music and this helps me to get focussed, or where I have to do a boring activity, like cleaning the house, music makes it fun. Music helps us to memorize some moments. Imagine a wedding, and the music that the bride and groom dance to, you'll always remember that moment because the music makes the moment special. Besides, music awakes in us a lot of feelings, and this is such a good sensation, whenever I listen to music that I really like, I feel better. I can't imagine my life without music, it would be so boring. Can you imagine a party with your family and friends without music? How would it be?

Hi Matt, It is the year 2022 and to improve my English first, I'm studying with Cambly. On this new platform I talk with native people, it is really hard because I don't understand some accents. I guess I will improve my listening skills. Second, I use "Write and Improve" to work on my writing skills; in the output field and input field I use the typical advice.

I just want them to play for a small amount of time, and if they play more than the time I allowed, I will not let them play anymore. I want to give them the positive effects and limit the negative impacts. They can play after school or when they have finished their homework, so they can get entertainment for a bit. When I was young, I liked playing video games too, but after a long time I thought it was boring and really expensive. So from that day on I never played them again. My son is scared of me, so he never asks or tells me that he wants to play that funny little game. But sometimes I know what he wants, so I give it to him. When I was angry he just played sports outside, but he knew that when I was back to normal, he could play that crazy little game on my phone!

Which is better, university students moving away and living on their own while they are attending school, or living at home with their family while they are students? I think it is up to the personalities and the condition of their family. Each of them has different merits and demerits. Therefore, there is no absolutely correct answer. The independence of a university student from his/her family may lead to growth in his/her personality. This experience helps him/her to live after graduation. However, it costs many financial burdens for them and their family. Some need to help their family, and it may make it to be difficult for them to study at university. If the students can't afford to live alone, they perhaps should live at home with their families. The less concern they have, the more they can live freely. It may lead to their growth. For the reasons stated above, I can't choose which is better, but I think they should select what they think is better so that they can study well.

I am going to start my explanation with a classic sentence: it depends. If the zoo offers premises in a good condition and space for those animals, it could become a great source of education and spread the importance of taking care of our environment. Taking kids to the zoo is a great way to connect them with wild animals and show them how important it is to preserve our natural resources. To be fair, I understand people who don't like zoos and to keep animals caged for entertainment purposes. Also, we have to face illegal traffickers of wild animals every day and zoos offering awful conditions to their animals. I guess, good inspections and punishment would be a good option to reduce and monitor those black markets. To finish, I have to say the key will always be good education to prevent many of those situations where ignorance prevails, or those situations will keep happening with no remorse.

The question of how to live your life bothers most people. Will you choose a long life but boring or an exciting but short life? For me, I would choose a short but exhilarating life. Living a short but intense life means that my life is full of surprises. For example, I may be travelling worldwide and face dangerous situations like an avalanche taking place while I'm climbing Mount Qomolangma. But I will eventually be fine, and these thrilling moments will be saved in my mind as precious memories. It is also possible that I would win a million-dollar lottery and get cancer at the age of 50. Even though my life might be short and miserable at the end, I still wouldn't regret having this kind of life. Because what I have been through in my life can be written as an adventure book that can be read by generations. However, there are still people who prefer to live a long, calm life. Living a calm life means your family will be extremely steady. You may marry a girl in high school and have two lovely kids. You will wake up at 9 am, return at 5 pm; the rest of your time will be spent with your family, and it will repeat itself day by day, year by year. Although your life might be boring, it's still worth spending it with the family. At the end of your life, you will certainly die in happiness. In conclusion, I prefer to live a short but intensive life.

The Power of Music We need to express ourselves to communicate. We have been doing it for ages and music, whether for enjoyment in listening, the emotional response, performing it, or creating it, is important for us. Music also can be really powerful. Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer can remember a song from childhood because music can help us to connect, even after verbal communication becomes difficult. Music makes us remember a special time in our lives, whether good or bad, it is the last thing our brain forgets. Music is important no matter what age we have and accompanies us through moments. I can remember the first concert I went to. I can remember the first song I danced to with my husband. I often remember my mom's favorite song now that she is gone. I cannot imagine life without art. Art and music are basic human functions because the desire to create cannot be avoided.

Beyond any doubt, the ideal state of affairs would be always telling the truth, no matter the subject. Life in such a society would be far different from what we know in our own. There would not be a confidence crisis and everybody could trust without fear. However, actually we are not prepared for such a pristine truth. Frequently people see themselves compelled to lie in order to comply with social arrangements or etiquette. Let's see some examples. If someone asks about their own appearance, the answer will be invariably positive or, at least, not entirely negative, although we know that it is not always the case. The same happens when we give opinions concerning feelings and performances. In these situations we tend to mitigate and ornament the truth, what is not the same thing as being polite. Politeness and truth are compatible. This confusion is a common error. You can do both. However, as previously mentioned, since we are not ready to remove social conventions when they collide with the truth, some small "white lies" end up becoming necessary. Using the same example above: if you answer "you are ugly," certainly somebody's feelings will be hurt. It is better to avoid that. Unfortunately, pursuing veracity at all cost does not pay off yet. Nonetheless, I believe that one day, when we have learned to be more emotionally mature, the truth will reign undisputed.

Nowadays companies are concerned about the work environment, and therefore, there is a debate about whether offices should be open or enclosed spaces. Open designs are superior because of promoting friendly work places and discouraging competition. A open-space office develops a healthy work environment. In fact, cubicles without walls encourage workers to co-operate between each other due to the lack of communication barriers, making the work environment friendly. For example, these open designs have allowed tech-companies to improve their performance and productivity. Another point to take into account is that open-spaces might reduce hierarchy levels between workers because of the concept of sharing the space. Some detractors of this open-office layouts claim that it could reduce productivity. Although being in contact with everybody ,without physical restrictions, could lead to excessive loss of time, there is a great deal of evidence in favour. For example, it has been recognised that productivity is linked with healthy work environments, and as a consequence, better work performance is related to proper team work. In conclusion, the concept of open-offices is superior to traditional offices because it promotes a co-operative environment and helps to reduce job hierarchies, and all these factors are reflected in high productivity. The future of architecture is open spaces, in public and private sectors.

To begin with, I will tell you some disadvantages, but before that I can assure you that this experience is totally worth it. Speaking about disadvantages, first you will have the physical distance from your family and friends. For some people, this being far from those people can create a big impact and sadness. Especially in the first months, you will feel this in a deep way. With time, things starts to get better, and you learn to deal with it. Another disadvantage is learning to deal with a new culture, food, and bureaucracy. After dealing with all those initial problems, you will learn a lot, get much stronger, and finally more independent.

The moment young people have to choose a university they balance their qualities and skills with what they would like most to work as. To my mind, it depends on the type of person students are that influences most their decision regarding whether to live on their own or with their family. It is a well known fact that moving away requires a broad sense of independence. Young people who live alone must singly manage their finances and learn how to better plan their schedule in order for them to cope with everyday challenges. Moreover, they need to cook and do the laundry individually without the help of a relative. On the other hand, deciding to remain at home during their college years has its benefits. Students can be supported by their families, who help young people with the house chores while they have more time socialise and a higher level of energy to put into their studies. What is more, it is less likely for students who live with their relatives to get homesick. All things considered, young people have to make an important decision when choosing where to continue their studies, thus they need every bit of support they can get from their loved ones.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that talking about university is difficult, since it is a crucial decision that students must take. They become adults and, as a result, independent people. I met some people who, despite the distance, are studying in crowded Spanish places, like Madrid or Barcelona. As a consequence, learners have to live alone or in student communities, where they share a room to pay less money. I agree that living without parents is going to prepare youth for their future life, and it is perfect if you want to get married or if you want to have children, but it is true that you must have a considerable amount of money in your wallet. Moreover, the student must be a mature person, because he has other responsibilities besides getting an exceptional degree and join a job. Looking at the other option, although it is great to have a bed, food and water completely free, and you don't miss your family, I think independence is a crucial part of people's life, so the sooner you leave home, the earlier you get independence and responsibilities. Anyway, I would choose the first option because, in spite of the amount of money, you can always get a temporary job to earn money.

Music is an immaterial element of human culture and society. To live with songs at different moments, for example, in a school class or at home moment. It helps improve emotional intelligence and social skills, beyond that mathematical ability and concentration. However, for some families there isn't this acknowledgement that active music or learning to play an instrument is essential for the whole formation of a person. Based on scientific indication, music contributes to development of a lot of important skills in children and young people. To learn a musical instrument or take a class is strong tool to achieve concentration and better results in math tasks, for example. The music class present in every school can try to deliver the basic fundamentals of education and to give seeds to shine the interested. The learning process sometimes focuses on "scientific subjects." This eyes put on second plan things relative to culture. In this side, music is only seen as fun, and we forget the science of the back play songs. Because of this some families don't care about music classes and some schools don't have this kind of class available. Music is more or less important for some parents or curricular projects at school. What a lot of people agree is that music is an interesting art for everyone to learn to develop more completely. Then, the music class must be present in every basic school, although some schools or families don't worry about this discipline.

In the past fifty years, English has become an internationally spoken language , which is extremely convenient. However , it doesn't mean learning other foreign languages is now useless. In my opinion, learning a foreign language these days is as important as it was in the past. Learning a foreign language is indeed a real asset for travel or work. Speaking foreign languages is a plus in a job market that is ever more competitive, especially when you want to work abroad. In addition, there are nowadays more and more colleges that besides asking for English-speaking students ask for German and/or Russian-speaking students. With globalization, being able to communicate with someone who doesn't have the same native language as you and who doesn't necessarily speak English is a real advantage. Secondly, beyond the usefulness of learning a foreign language, it is an excellent exercise for the brain. Specialists say that the more you learn, the more learning becomes easier. Therefore, learning several foreign languages is far from being unreachable. Furthermore, it gives exercise to your brain, which can be quite useful indeed.

My favorite season of the year is summer because of the warm weather, the school vacation, and the endless fun. I really enjoy the warm weather because it’s the perfect time to do outdoor activities. My favorite part of summer has to be the fact that school is closed for two months. During summer, you’re free to do whatever you want, not worrying about curfews or waking up early for school. Summer time is a great time to relax with friends and family by soaking up the sun at a beach or having dinner together. I love the hot and humid days that make you want to dive into a fresh and cold pool. When summer time starts, you can wear lighter clothes, which are much more comfortable. The weather allows people to go outdoors , too. The break calls for staying up late and waking up whenever you want to. Everyone works so hard during the school year, so they deserve that free time. Summer times are stress free, relaxing, and basically fun. You don’t have to worry about homework, projects, and studying for a test. One of my favorite summer pastimes is staying up late watching movies and eating junk food, and then waking up late and having brunch.

In this essay, I would like to consider the topic The School of the Future. In this day and age , we are living in a society in which technology is around us in many different ways. For instance, distinct gadgets and appliances are used in houses at the moment with the aim of facilitating our daily life, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, computers... We can also use these new technologies for working with laptops, tablets ... and so on in many different aspects of our lives. Therefore, school has to have these advantages thanks to technologies. Some lessons can be followed online and projects and tasks can be done by internet and sent in real time. Conferences can be realised in real time from several parts of the world. I think that we have to incorporate these advantages, but we can lose the principal aim of school, socialization. But we can't forget personal relationships, we are social animals and we have to be in contact with other people.

To be honest, I have never thought about whether I have a favourite holiday. To begin with, I will start writing about the first holiday that comes to my mind. Before the pandemic, I made a big trip to Europe, the whole trip took almost a month. On this trip, I visited Austria, Hungary, England, Poland, Germany, and lastly Portugal. The amazing thing about this trip is that I travelled with different people during the journey. Each friend had his own style and personality, which gave an exciting touch to the trip. I think that's the reason why this holiday was one of the most important ones to me. As an old quote says, 'Happiness is only real when shared'. So I lived really great moments, and most importantly, I was with my friends. So many stories and people we met during the trip. I was able to visit old friends which I hadn't seen in years. To finish with, that holiday made me know a lot about myself and going beyond my limits, physically and mentally speaking.

Listen to life's music. Are you one of those who can't live without listening to music? If your answer was yes, this article was made for you. Music has a huge impact on our lives, since it can change our frame of mind and bring different memories to us. For instance, when I go to the gym to have my daily workout I need my headphones in order to give my best. There are songs that motivate me and I feel powerful while I'm listening to them. At the same time, we can remember different moments or people with songs. In my case when I listen to Oh Darling Mama, I always remember those summers with my family in Las Bahamas. Personally speaking, if we didn't have music, life would be a lot more boring, therefore we should keep creating new songs and playing with new music styles.

In general it is not a good solution to ban something or the behaviour of people by using a legal rule. I prefer to convince people of the right behaviour. In this case the Town council would like to ban mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. The difficulty of this rule is how it is to be applied and controlled. The Town council must create a police squad to check if the rule is effectively applied ! This squad will be a source of tensions between citizens, and owners of restaurants. That also causes stress between citizens. It will provoke fighting between us where a police squad will be obliged to intervene. This situation risks degenerating! It will be better for the Town council to promote a preventive action. Each citizen will be an actor of this change. It will occasion to promote new values of conviviality in public areas. The Town council will also promote places where you can use phones. For example, a telephone booth where nobody will be disturbed. In fact this is a problem of education and well-being. The Town council must introduce information in a college class about a good attitude in the area with your phone or other technology. The goal of these classes will teach us how to live with other members of the public in public areas. This policy will be useful for other areas of living well together.

When a magazine contacted me to write an article about music, I suddenly thought of all the positive things that it has. In my opinion, we can't live without music. Listening to music has different relations. For example, there is a special link between music and mood. Because of this, we listen to sad music when we get sad or the reverse, happy music when we feel over the moon. Needless to say that there is also angry music, such as a Beethoven symphony that we listen to when we get angry. I would add how important music is in our life. All of us have different music styles depending on our stage of life. Have you ever found out about your changes in music? I'm sure that the music that you used to listen to when you were young was very different from now. In conclusion, I think that we have different genres of music in every moment of our life.

English is one of the most spoken languages in the world. Due to that fact, I think it is really important and useful to learn how to speak it. However, unfortunately learning English is not easy. The process involves months of hard work just to become conversational and years to become fluent. It also costs time, money, and sometimes can be deeply frustrating. But even so, I strongly believe there are a lot of reasons to learn English. Here you have some of them: First of all, I think a language is not just a tool to communicate, it is also a huge part of our identity. It is how we think and how we see the world. Therefore learning English allows you to be in contact with other ways of thinking. Secondly, you become more independent. If you know how to speak in English you can travel wherever you want without fear of not being able to express yourself. In other words, learning English can increase your confidence. Last but not least, the process of learning English is an ideal opportunity to make new friends from all over the world. You can find a lot of people who will be happy to practise English with you. To sum up, learning English is an amazing experience that involves many positive things.

It is a fact that nowadays there are many students who choose to study abroad, most of them in order to learn another language. If you are a student and are thinking about studying in another country you should know that this unique experience has a lot of perks, but unfortunately also disadvantages. On the one hand, in terms of advantages, apart from learning a new language, studying abroad allows you to learn about another culture, which helps you to be in contact with other ways of thinking. Furthermore, being far from home and your family, helps you to become more independent. Last but not least, studying in another country can help you to make new friends. On the other hand, regarding the disadvantages, you have to face a big challenge: listen to a foreign language 24 hours a day, which could be hard if you are not familiar with the language. Furthermore, unfortunately studying abroad requires money to cover different expenses, such as flights, accommodation, food, etc. In summary, I believe there are more perks than disadvantages, but you have to consider all of them in order to make a wise decision before moving to study in another country. If I were you I would grab the opportunity, as it may be once in a lifetime.

The first step is define what is true and what is a lie. That is extremely important because often we believe that it is too simple because people think that it is obvious. In fact there is no ambiguity when the situation is simple and the answer is black or white! After these details you can have discussions on this subject. Truth or lies are moral rules given be society to drive the relationship between people. That is a somewhat crucial rule because that is the cement of life in a country but there is no legal sanction of contact relations. These moral rules are taught at school and also by religion. When the people in a state are very educated, the rule is much better respected because people know that if there are no moral rules in the state, it will become an anarchy. For this reason it is important to improve the education of the people and teach civic education. This will be a guarantee for quality of life and a strong economic development. It is important to understand that life and economic relations are based on trust. Trust is an important value. Nothing can be built without mutual trust. Therefore it is important to tell the truth. But sometimes there is exception to this rule when you tell a lie to avoid critical situation For example when somebody is very jealous of another for a reason of pride, it is better to tell a little lie!

My favorite movie is Assassination classroom, it is an action movie, and it is an anime movie. There are also some comedy parts in the movie to make the audience laugh. At that time, there is a guy whose name is Koro, he has destroyed half of the moon, and now, he is going to destroy the Earth. But it is so easy for him so he feels bored and thinks about something more fun to do before destroying this beautiful planet. He become a teacher in the worst class, class 3-E, and promises that within a year if none of the students in the class can kill him, he will destroy the whole Earth. Through the film are all kinds of games that class 3E create to kill Koro-sensei (the name that the class gives to their teacher) They can not kill him, from guns and daggers, to bombs and traps. Through each failed assassination, they learned more experiences and became more mature in each of Koro-sensei's lessons, which were added into each game. The movie takes the audience through many kinds of feelings whenever they see the daring and elaborate plans of the 3E students. Through failed assassination, they discover their own potential, like a nerd girl becoming a potions expert, a forgetful class couple becoming a sniper, an ordinary student turning into a great leader. Each individual is a story of its own, waiting for viewers to discover. In the end, Koro-sensei is killed, the class was sad, they miss the day they studied with Koro-sensei, but just some seconds later, Koro-sensei appears behind the students, it turns out everything was fake, and the assassination mission continued. It is the best movie I have ever seen, it has a part 2 already but I don't have time to watch it, I hope that I can watch it soon, I recommend you watch it, it's very nice.

I'm the kind of person who sleeps in a dark and quiet room. Firstly, I don't like the light shining on my face while I'm sleeping, it is so annoying. Furthermore, those things make me feel like I sleep in the morning and that's quite ridiculous. If there is an enforced situation, I can't stand it because I just don't like it. Lastly, noise is another problem. I can't even go to sleep with music on. In addition, it can be a big challenge if I have to sleep in a house near a construction site.

One of the things that worries people most today is that in many rural areas there are not enough doctors and in the long run it causes serious problems. In the following paragraphs, I am going to try to answer because in rural areas I believe we are short of doctors. Mainly, the new doctors are more ambitious than in the past. They need to earn more money because they want to live better. It must be added that in the city , you can be promoted and you have more opportunity to research. With this problem, on the one hand, I consider that some means solutions to the lack of doctors are; the Mayor could pay them for a house in rural areas. I believe that it is a way to attract and promote a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, the government could create a subsidy for doctors in their taxes and in the future there could be laboratories for research in rural areas. In summary, I consider that I have taken some solutions for this big problem, but I really think that it is complicated to change their minds.

When somebody asks me what my favourite season of the year is, I do not have to think too hard. Speaking for myself, I strongly believe that winter is the best season of the year for a wide number of reasons. First of all, I know that most people think that during winter the weather sometimes is really cold, but I can't bear the heat. Moreover, the weather is not always freezing in winter. There are days when the weather brightens up, allowing you to enjoy the sunshine. Secondly, there are a lot of things to do during this season of the year, both indoors and outdoors. For instance, if you enjoy spending your leisure time outdoors, you can do winter sports, such as snowboarding, skiing or ice skating, among others. These are very exciting sports which, unfortunately, cannot be enjoyed in summer. Last but not least, Christmas in Spain is celebrated in winter. I personally love Christmas because you can spend a nice time with your family and friends. It is a very emotional holiday and one of the main reasons I love winter. In summary, winter is my favorite season of the year due to the fact that it offers you many beautiful things to do.

Hi Harry, How are you doing? I'm writing to you because I'd like to talk to you about my favorite film. Don’t worry, I'm not going to spoil it! As you know, I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson. I'm obsessed with all of his movies, but without doubt my favorite is "Moonrise Kingdom”. What to say about this masterpiece? I think the plot is exciting and the personalities of the characters are so well constructed that it’s easy to empathise with their feelings and emotions. Not no mention the cinematography of the film, which is amazing! Wes Anderson has a great knowledge of colour, composition, and lighting and has also a keen eye for detail. In my opinion, the film is so absorbing that time simply flies by. If you have some time on your hands I think you should watch this film. I'm pretty sure you’re going to enjoy it! Drop me a line and let me know if you’re going to watch it. By the way, do you fancy an outing to the beach next weekend? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Lots of love, Tina

It is undeniably true that the majority of adolescents are living a fast-paced life these days. The most competitive environment leads them to have less extra time to do physical activities for their health. Some people are convinced that teenagers need to put aside some time for leisure activities and do exercise at least 3 times per week. In this essay, I am going to explain why I agree with that statement by giving some suitable reasons and proper examples. To start with, it is one of the excellent ideas to maintain young people's health and physical outlook to be good and healthy. To be more specific, nowadays, people, especially young children, are dealing with stresses and tiredness in their daily lives due to their work, school and social barriers. In that case, keeping time free for doing sports and physical exercises can help them to get away from their daily stresses and tiredness, and enjoy the taste of freedom for a while. It can, moreover, recharge and refresh their energy for the next few days. Encouraging teens to carry out sports and exercises can also bring numerous advantages not only for their health but also for their performance in school or university. To illustrate that, doing the proper amount of exercises can measure a good circulation of blood in the body, which makes students be able to be more active and focused while they are doing their school assignments. Then, doing some sports; football and basketball, enhances students' teamwork and critical skills, which are vital personal skills that students are going to need when they enter the workplace later. To summarize, it is crucial for teenagers to make some time free to do some physical activities and sports in order to avoid depression and failure in their lives. Then, doing exercise is the best way to break away from the children's inactive lifestyles or run away from the screen.

It goes without saying that our workspace has to be a place where you could feel comfortable enough, so as to develop your tasks with as much efficiency as possible. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would mention that the way space is designed at one's work is usually claimed to be a substantial point in order to make us feel comfortable while working, and I could not agree more. Some conditions like illumination, proximity to your home, accessibility, partnerships, and so on, make comfort something possible for an individual. Nevertheless, some other factors can be nowadays claimed as significant like the case of design. Concerning this, we find those who defend an open design, pleading with the fact that information and ideas can be shared more easily that way, not to mention how much that enables socializing. Despite the benefits resulting from an open design, I cannot help but add that there are some jobs in which privacy is needed in order to achieve our goals. That could be the case of a writer, for example, or someone else whose job requires solitude for them to be focused. Last but not least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that our personality is also crucial when it comes to choosing a work atmosphere. The one you find suitable for you is undoubtedly the best atmosphere to reach your desired aims.

Hi Harry, Thank you for your last letter, it’s always good to hear from you! I'm delighted to know that you and your family are well. Guess what? Last week, I went to a music concert in Madrid. It was the birthday of my best friend, María, so I decided to invite her to go to a Justin Bieber concert. She is totally obsessed with Justin, so imagine her face when I gave her the tickets. The concert was in a football stadium and, although it was crowded, we enjoyed it very much. Before the concert started, we could hear the band warming up off stage. It was very exciting! Then Justin kicked off the concert with a great song. We were dancing and singing during the whole concert. What a night to remember!

I consider that learning a foreign language is quite important these days. Actually , we are living in a multicultural society, that is to say, a society in which different people from different countries live together. When people have to change their habitual home and have to emigrate to other countries for work , personal problems, or armed conflict... it's important to know a foreign language. The knowledge of other languages opens our minds, we are more tolerant and we learn to appreciate our own mother tongue. Learning a new language is the opportunity to communicate with other people in order to establish different kinds of relationship. Nowadays, we have many options to learn a new language and we have to do it. Technologies and the use of social media is an excellent way to start. Listening to the radio , watching TV, and reading in the language which you are learning is the way to improve your new language.

Rising obesity rates have been labeled one of, if not the most, severe public health crises of today. Other illnesses caused by an inactive lifestyle are on the rise as well, although they do not reach the same levels of publicity. To combat these emergent problems we should put renewed effort into the physical education of our children, instigating mandatory physical exercise as a promising approach in this regard. University students, as well as all other adults, should be incentivised to lead an active life. It is without question that children need to be taught about the benefits of an active lifestyle. The health problems we as a society are facing are a direct result of neglecting physical education and failing to prepare becoming adults for the challenges of increasingly sedentary jobs. Likewise, it is apparent that such a programme must not be based on pure theory. School children need to experience the benefits of physical exercise first hand - they have to do sports activities on a regular basis. To achieve this, schools should expand PE classes and complement them with other measures such as mandatory participation in a sports club, compelling students to do sports at least 3 times a week. In contrast, all adults - including university students - should be regarded as self-determined members of our society and have the right to refuse any physical exercise if they so desire. For them, incentives can replace obligations as a means to encourage an active lifestyle. Universities could consider rewarding participation in sports teams and insurance companies may offer lower policy rates to those that are physically active. In essence, the primary instrument to tackle public health crises will always remain the education of our children. They should leave school fit to tackle the challenges modern work environments present. For adults, incentivising an active lifestyle should replace compulsory measures.

I am a doctor, I work at a rural hospital, and I'm tired because I have a lot of work, the medical service is scarce here. There is only a small hospital for all people of the town. We are two doctors and seven nurses. It is very impossible to attend to many people. In fact, some patients need a special medical treatment such as surgery, but we don't give them this. The main reasons for this issue is that the place is not in the vicinity of the city, and many doctors do not want to change their place of home, and leave your families, and leave their families, although several times they make a lot of money in the cities, the life is not easy here, because there are no places to have fun, such as parks, museums, supermarkets etc. On another hand, the afternoons are very beautiful, you can breathe the clean air, and look at the mountains. I think that the solution is complicated, but maybe, the doctors could come to visit our hospital for some weeks, and to get to know the town and the nice friendly people. I'm not sure that they would like your place of residence. But they will have a great experience.

Music is always present in the most important moments of our lives, from the saddest moments to the most joyful ones. I daresay that music is something essential in our life. But the main question is: do you think all students should have to study music? First of all, I think that music has several benefits for us, apart from being enjoyable and a form of expression. In fact, according to different experts, music can help us to manage our emotions and feelings. Therefore there is a strong link between our mood and the music we choose to listen to. I strongly believe that music is a subject that should be included in the curriculum of all schools. Studying music should be as necessary and important as other subjects such as mathematics or science. In my opinion, music can contribute to the good development of our children. It is a creative way for students to express their emotions and a way to learn about culture and history. In summary, we need to raise awareness about the value and importance of studying music at schools. Therefore it is necessary that our governments make laws in order to implement these subjects. I hope in the future all students will be able to study music and that it will be as valued as studying mathematics.

The rural area can be a big problem because it doesn't give us enough comfort to work or live there, mainly if you grew up in the big city where this place offers many benefits such as electricity, potable water and you can buy anything either in shops or e - commerce with no problem to find a shop close to you, besides having a great control about wild animals. Firstly, the electricity suppliers should spread the electricity and offer enough comfort to live on a hot day or not. Secondly, the spread of the shops around the rural areas is important to increase access to goods and services. I don't mean they must create too many shops in order to remove the view of the rural area. But, offering specific point shops along the way.

A lot of doctors says that sitting and doing no sport is the new smoking and is really bad for you. This inactive lifestyle has many negative effects on health. This is why I would discuss if all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. I agree that university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. The first argument is that will help to become a better team. This means that sport especially a team sport in the school or in the university will help you and your classmates to become a team, because in some sports activities you learn to work together and be a good and fair team player, which will help in the end to form a better team in class too. The next thing is that it helps you to get more focused on things. Because of the motivation and metal strength that you need to do sport, you learn these skills which help you not only in the sport. These skills will also be useful in other parts of your life or important skills too for learning at school for exams and focusing on what you do or what you will do in the future. The last and the best point is that sport has a effect on your health. To be healthy some studies say that you should do at least 10000 steps every day. So it is important for everyone to do sport every day. It is not so important what sport you do. There is not so much difference in the effects. More important is that you do a sport that you like so that you are motivated to do your sport every day and do not give up after some days or weeks. These are my arguments why I think it is important for university students and school children to do sport at least 3 times per week.

It is argued that today's teens are the least active in decades. This statement can be sustained not only by the increasing number of young people with different illnesses associated to obesity but also by the worrying number of fast food businesses, which rises year by year. I believe we should all be aware of the negative consequences an unhealthy diet might cause us and try moving out of the comfort zones which we are so familiar with. Although it might seem a drastic measure, I agree with the proposal that teenagers and students should attend sport classes at least three times a week. I will sustain my view with the following arguments. First, the small number of sports hours in schools barely allow the teachers to enterprise some new activities. The coach is usually focused on following the school programme. If the number of classes are to be raised, he would be more willing to diversify the educational programme, therefore some nutrition advice or examples of exercises to be done at home might be of his interest. Then, the students could be determined to take part in additional sports competitions, if they felt they were prepared enough for them. More exercise means more self-confidence. Playing sports can teach students how to become a leader, a follower and how to work together to achieve a common goal. Another important factor is the self-esteem the teenager could improve, by reshaping their body within the sports room. Some might argue that if someone wants to lose weight, then it's up to him, but in reality is very challenging and it is difficult to stick to the plan if he is on his own. A class group engaged in sports activities would be far more effective and efficient, with visible results. Sports benefits for young people are undeniable and the entitled authorities should play their part in supporting them.

According to a recent survey, most people watch TV in order to be entertained. This survey also shows that for the majority of viewers the main purpose of TV is to entertain. But the first question we must ask ourselves is: can it also educate? In my opinion, I think that TV can also educate in different ways. On the one hand, there are countless documentaries you can watch on TV about different subjects, such as history, animals, or science, among others. TV also offers you a window to foreign cultures and, therefore, allows you to be in contact with other ways of thinking. On the other hand, TV can sometimes be used as a way to educate children. Without doubt, cartoons have the potential to teach them important things, such as values and life lessons. In summary, it is a fact that the purpose of TV is not only to entertain, but also to inform and educate people.

I don't hate my co-workers, absolutely not!, but, when it comes to choosing a type of workstation, if I could, I actually prefer staying alone. When I am doing my activities and there is no one next to me, my mind works smoothly and the results become better. Noise next to me can make me not pay attention to what I must. More than this: a great proportion of people don't talk with a low sound... They almost do this in a high voice, and they ignore the moment to stop the speeches and return to their own activities. This makes me feel annoyed, and I need to control myself: I almost always have the impulse to be myself: I almost always have the impulse of being uneducated. In a nutshell, these are the reasons I like working isolated from others. When I am alone, in a cubicle (not too small, of course!) or separated by walls, I feel I am more productive, my mind works better and staying far from the number of co-workers' voices takes me to more tranquility. When I am alone, I even listen to music while I am developing my tasks. (You must agree with me: Working this way is much more difficult if the place where you are laboring is full of people talking about several subjects unrelated to your tasks, right?). So, I will ask you one thing... if someday you want to give me an opportunity to work with your employees, please... let me do it in a cubicle, or in a place with walls separating me from my co-workers, OK? I promise I will have friendship with them, but, in the moment of working, I need silence, peace and maximum concentration... And my results will be the best!

From: Philip Subject: my favourite film My favourite film is The Last Holiday. It is rated 4.9 stars on IDBI and is also one of the highest grossing films in the USA. I just love the film because it is funny and the main character is having a great time at a luxurious hotel and eating luxurious food. There is an antagonist whose name is Kraken, who is a big boss of a big company and is really grumpy. He always wants to compete against the main character, but in the end he learns his lesson. After knowing that she is going to live a bit longer, the main character opens a restaurant that attracts billions of customers.

Today in Sweden, there is a huge variation between how much young people do sports activities. Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. First of all, it improves your learning. When exercising, the blood flows to your brain and the rest of your body. Studies state that you are more concentrated after being physically active for at least 30 minutes. This means that exercising during school will help focus during lessons and therefore lead to increased grades. Secondly, it helps to reduce the risks of mental illness. Mental illness is an increased problem in our society. Not only among adults, but also among children. Loneliness is one cause of mental illness which can be avoided by joining a team. When you join a sport team you will be a part of a group. You may also make new friends. Problems can be shared with a friend and make you feel better, and thereby improve chances of not being mentally ill. I understand that not everyone will agree at first. Why be forced? My answer to that is that now we see a problem with the inactive lifestyle of many children and to solve that problem, we need to make it easier to live an active lifestyle. So, how could we make it easier? To start with, I think it is necessary to force students to join sports teams in school because then they do not have any excuse. Children and teenagers will find new favorite activities that will last them forever. To improve learning, reduce risks of mental illness and to make it easier to live an active lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week.

The spark you need. Sports are fun, sport is teamwork and sports could be the spark you need. But today many people, like students and school children are only gaming and not playing around a pitch. This are repercussions because the health of those among us is getting bad very bad. So the youngsters among us need to be forced to do sports related activities for at least 3 times a week and this is why. The phenomenon of gaming has become an ordinary thing in today's society. But not all things it brings are benefits. Most of the consequences are bad, very bad. Firstly, teenagers who near the ages of 15 or 16 are having a bow in their posture due to staring for hours and hours at a monitor. Another aftereffect of watching the same screen for hours and hours is that more and more children and students need glasses with the result that the prices for glasses are rising speedily. We can fix these blights, watch how America did it. They invested a lot of money in activities related to sport such as a sports academy and not only for talented sportsmen or women. Secondly, the American government also launched a new government area that is focusing on the brain activity of humans during exercise. They see a significant result in health but also a great impact on self-esteem, so instead of people feeling more stressed they feel much more at ease. Perhaps you are now thinking after reading this why we don't have something like this here in Europe. Well, that comes from the massive cultural diversity here in Europe. But with effort I think we can overcome this obstacle and create an all sports based culture and personally I have a little hope that this will happen in the next few years and that the next generation will be the fittest and strongest generation that ever walked on earth.

I believe that efficiency should depend on the type of work performed by the office. For example, an accounting office is not the same as an advertising office. When your work is creative, the design of the space is an important part; colors, rooms to relax, having a meeting with clients or talking with other colleagues are important. You also have to think that some people work better in silence, others need music to be creative and all those elements must be considered in the design of the office. Now, if we talk about a more routine type of work, comfortable seating and a good coffee station are elements to consider. However, if we want to reach real efficiency in the design of the workspace, we must talk to the people who work in that office. For example: what do they need to be more effective in their work? How could this area be more comfortable to work in? Their opinion is important to determine if we missed a mistake in the design. In conclusion, together: workers, design experts, contractors must be listened to in order to reach an agreement on on design effectiveness.

Working as a volunteer, apart from being a requirement to graduate, is an exciting and worthwhile experience for all students. Therefore, I think that complete a certain amount of volunteer work has a lot of benefits for them. First of all, volunteering during high school allows students to develop and improve new skills. Furthermore, it is also a fantastic way to explore diverse career paths and opportunities. When it comes to choosing a field of study, volunteer work can help students discover what they want to be in the future. Secondly, volunteering allows students to support causes and help people and communities in need. In other words, they could make the world a better place. Thirdly, experiences like volunteering can help students to improve their mental health and emotional well-being. According to a recent survey, volunteer work can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Lastly, I know that not all students have the time to work as a volunteer. The life of most of them can be busy, if not chaotic. In spite of this, I strongly believe that this requirement is a fantastic experience for all students.

I believe that all students should learn about music and, I'm not saying this because I'm a musician and play saxophone, I believe that learning to play an instrument, to read a score, has a huge benefit. First of all, music can develop a child's talent, how do you know if you are good or bad in something if you do not try? Also, studies indicate that playing an instrument is correlated with academic success because music is another language that develops the left side of the brain. At the same time, music is fun, enjoyable, relieves stress in children, and teaches little ones to concentrate, which are great benefits to consider. Another reason I wanted to point out, which personally surprised me a lot, is that music helps to understand mathematics. Although they may seem different, music and mathematics have a lot in common. Aspects such as rhythm, proportions and fractions appear in the scores. To learn music, one must understand mathematics. Finally, music and self-expression are linked. We do not go to school just to learn traditional tasks, we also go to school to know ourselves, to know how far we can go, what our limits are, and music can serve to achieve that important kind of knowledge.

Nowadays, we are living in an era in which technology is developing very rapidly. Video games are very popular, especially among children. As far as I am concerned, I feel that video games have a negative impact on children. On the one hand, I think that most video games are too violent for children. Furthermore, alcohol and drugs often appear in these video games. This is one of the main reasons why some parents believe that video games have negative effects on children’s development. On the other hand, playing video games for long hours is harmful. According to most doctors, children who play video games for long hours and do not do physical activity develop more illnesses. Therefore, we need to raise awareness about the importance of doing regular exercise and reduce the number of hours that children spend playing video games. In summary, as parents, we must be careful with our children’s video games, as they may have a harmful impact on them.

What kind of life would you like to live? The answer to this question is function on the personal goal of each person. There is not a great or bad choice, there is just a personal choice. Another difficulty is life won't be excepted and for this reason there are alternate periods of quiet and intense times. For this reason it is very difficult to describe a quiet or intense life because that won't be possible. But if I must make a theoretical choice I would prefer a long calm life until 100 years old. Because I like to be quiet and have time to reflect on myself and the best situation to think about yourself is to be in calm and safe area. That is also an opportunity to rhythm your life of different time: learning meditating and taking care of your body. This is a choice of well-being. This style of life will give you a strong character and capacity to think thoughts. For me, I will be a more balanced person because I like the quiet environment without excitement surrounding me. With this style of life we will live very long time and I could see all the new technologies and innovations. I will also see many generations of people and I will be much quieter because I will have a vision of life with my experience.

The requirement of volunteer hours in order to graduate I think is positive for the student. The school should teach not only traditional homework, but also educate and show students other realities that are closer than they think. Volunteering has many benefits and if a sixteen or seventeen-year-old student has the opportunity to do it I think it is a great privilege that we cannot let pass and that we should encourage. Volunteering not only looks good to apply for university, but it is an activity that can give you a sense of purpose because you become part of something bigger than yourself, and that is an important lesson to learn in school. In addition, volunteering gives you a sense of community, helps you feel connected to the place where you live, and also you would see that similar and different people can be friends and connect in the same community. In short, doing volunteer work will only bring benefits to the student, such as a sense of purpose, a sense of community, they will have the opportunity to meet people and friends different from themselves, and having all those benefits at such a young age is something that every student should be able to have.

A few days ago I heard that town council is thinking of banning the use of mobile phones in public transport, stores and restaurants, and I believe this ban could be a big mistake. Mobile phones are part of our lives. People use their phones to chat with friends, relatives, or even a co-worker on their way to the office. You can also use your phone to, for example, read the news, just as many phones have apps to read books on them. In addition, you can also pay with your phones nowadays for whatever you want to buy, experts say it is safer to pay with your phone than with your card or cash, so, why ban phones in stores if they are necessary? Why ban phones in restaurants if you can also pay for your food with your phone, but you can also see the menu of a restaurant using a QR code, which is safer nowadays because of the pandemic and possible infections. We cannot go back in time where people communicated differently, those times are long gone. We live in this age where mobile phones are not just for making a call, we have so many things on our phones, we can do so many things with it than ban will only cause great dissatisfaction in people. I encourage the town council to focus on the real issues that affect the citizens and discard any ban on mobile phones.

Dear legislators, Recently, I've heard some news that you're going to pass a law that will ban people from using mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants for safety reasons, because the government wants people to be more concerned about the environment they live in. In addition, the government also hopes to strengthen the interaction between citizens and makes the town a more harmonious and warm town. Well, as long as I know the details of this act, I have some suggestions for you who represent us to make a appropriate balanced point between safety and the practical side in the future. First of all, for safety reasons, I agree with the purpose of banning people from using cell phones on public transport, while I'm opposed to putting this act in practice in the occasions such as restaurants or shops because the probability of security problems like killing, robbing, rowdiness is far less than that in public transport. For example, if someone got robbed or hurt on public transport, because everyone is phubbing so that no one noticed that someone has got hurt then it may cause more casualties in transportation. Contrarily, in restaurants or shops, it's obvious that anyone but the robber will try to help the victim suppress the bad guy, because barely each person will look around the environment such as stores and goods, even if some people are still looking at their phones. Thus, shops and restaurants are probably safer than public transport, which is not to the extent that the government mandates not to use phones. Second, I'm against banning cellphones in restaurants and shops, simply because the government wants civilians to have more face-to-face communication so that everyone, even strangers, isn't indifferent, which will improve our reputation for hospitality. Nowadays, phones have become a medium to communicate, show concerns and express opinions. People will be connected more closely than ever, and still, most people will have interactions if necessary. Therefore, the government is over-thinking.

There's going to be a collection of paintings by Dalí. Do you know his work? He gained recognition in the first half of the 20th century. He became a leading figure in the surrealism movement.

In my opinion, always telling the truth is not a proper way to get along with others in any occasions, as we are usually be taught to be honest about everything when we were children. Sometimes, difficult as it seems, we need to have some sweet lies rather than a bitter truth that may make us embarrassed and tense, to achieve positive future outcomes and a harmonious atmosphere. Firstly, sometimes if we are too honest, we may have some straightforward words for others, especially for some who are sensitive to others' words and inclined to be negative, or we will have more impacts on both society and personal life. For example, if someone is a little bit obese since you met them last time, given that she may not a negative description of her body, especially when she is depressed, we couldn't tell the truth to her directly. Instead, we should polish our words to be more euphemistic lest he/she feels that his/her self-esteem is hurt and then have some behavior harming either herself or us. Second, to have a positive consequence, there are some situations in life when it is not appropriate to say more details to others in case they lose hope or even be killed. For instance, if we are doctors and are faced with a patient whose condition has deteriorated and may have recently passed away, we have to inform their parents that there is still hope for a cure only if they can abide by the directions, of which the purpose is to give some hope to patients and their family so that they will not feel like falling into the abyss of despair. In conclusion, although not telling a lie is a virtue, we need to learn when should we decorate and pack our words in a little polite way and will not hurt someone's heart stikingly. Therefore, telling a lie can be accepted in some situations.

Spring, the best season After days of freezing finally spring is starting. It means that probably your mood will change, because the sun has a direct effect on our mood. Why don't you think about all the good things that spring has? Firstly, I would point out that the days become longer. As a result, we can do many activities such as walking, meeting, etc. In some countries you can also see free concerts outdoors and parties. Secondly, there is a lot of color in the streets, because not only are the shops showing coloured clothes in their shop windows, but also the houses have flowers. Last but not least, we have to pay fewer bills in spring because we need less light and fire. Therefore, we can spend that money on holidays. In a nutshell, I would add that the weather is fabulous, because it is damp, neither too hot nor too cool.

There is nothing more important than humans' health nowadays. However, due to the stress and workload of study and work, coupled with addiction to digital devices, exercise has gradually become less important and neglected. On the topic of whether university students should be forced to do sports or not, I fully agree that students need to exercise every week. Firstly, exercise is an essential activity for our health, which can reduce the probability of getting diseases and syndromes of the heart, diabetes or blood pressure and other disorders, especially for students who spend their spare time on sedentary activities such as working, doing homework, scrolling cellphones, watching TV, and using computers. Hence, mandatory participation in games and other exercises at schools and colleges can temporarily let students put down their phones, leave their seats, and do outdoor activities, and provide students' bodies with appropriate solutions to maintain their body health. Second, according to some experts' studies in medical field, exercise can also help students have a positive mind and good mood, which can reduce anxiety and depression, and contrarily, increase the motivation to face challenges when students are stuck in trouble. For example, if I have had trouble in my studies for a while, I feel that I will suffer from mental illness from the pressure. Thus, I will try to shift my attention from studying and compel them out of my brain by exercising. I will do some sports such as running or table tennis with my friends, which usually give me some new ideas about studies, give me more motivation for continuing learning, rejuvenate my thoughts, and have a better academic performance. So, it can be said that forcing the young ones to partake in healthy activities is indeed essential. To conclude, wellness, sports and activities are prominent to maintain a good body. In my opinion, the sporting sessions should be mandated around the world, in order to keep tomorrow's adults fit and to assist them in picking up a healthy lifestyle.

Dear Sam, Hope you are in radiant health. I am writing this letter to let you know that I recently attended a musical concert at 'The Sports Club' in New Delhi, and it reminded me of our college days. As you know I am fond of music, therefore, I planned to attend this musical festival. It was a great show, where various musical bands and singers such as 'The Indian Ocean,' and 'The Big Brothers,' exhibited their performances. Moreover, I loved the concert because of its amazing aura. Although it was a musical festival, there were dance performances by renowned artists, namely Malaika Arora, and Ashley Lobo. I would also want to tell you that, accidentally, I encountered our common friend Les Patterson at the concert. It was great to meet him after all these years.

I certainly agree with the fact that young people should do sports, as well as all the people during their life. An active lifestyle has positive effects on anyone, both on their physical health and on their mental health. I don't even think that both children and university students should be forced to do three hours of sports per week. I would let the families choose the combination, taking into account a lot of different situations, as well as the different characteristics of their sons. First of all, I think that school should treat gym as another subject, and should count on it at least two hours per week, but all together, that is to say: students should have time to change clothes, and to have showers afterwards. Two hours together would be enough to have an hour of effective sport or gym and an hour for changing (equipped bathrooms should be provided in any school). Later on, I suggest that each school should organize extra curriculum courses of sports in order to group those students that are most interested, at a very low extra charge. Finally, families could follow or not the teachers' advice of doing extra courses or not, depending on their sons' ability in the sport itself. In this sense I think that families should have the freedom to choose, also because sometimes they prefer to have children engaged in other activities, like music courses or other community social activities, or simply studying more. As regards students at university, finally, I think that they should be absolutely free to choose how to spend their time. They are mature enough to understand if they need some physical activity or not, and the activity could just be a walk in the city park rather than a precise sports activity.

People consider that telling the truth is always beneficial instead of telling lies. However, telling a lie is sometimes acceptable if the lie is not harmful for anybody. For example, Santa Claus's existence is told to children to keep their spirit up and improve their imagination. The first thing to consider is that people always lie for different reasons. Some lies have sincere intentions of not harming anyone, and some others are the opposite of this. For this reason, white lies are unavoidable for human beings many times to maintain order in society. For instance, telling someone you fell asleep, and that is the reason for arriving late to a meeting, is a lie to avoid memos or penalties. Hence, that is why the difference between white lies and harmful lies is the key when people tell the truth or a lie. Personally, I consider that truth is always important on account of the fact that people need to know what happens around them, whereas it is also acceptable to tell a lie when the situation requires it. To conclude, lies are not an act of evilness when the purpose of the lie is to avoid harm or damage. Therefore, a lie is fair if the purpose of the lie is to protect people from the truth. However, people can not dis - prestige the importance of the truth to know and grasp crucial events in people's lives.

Dear Sam, Hope you and and your family are in good health. I am so fortunate to find a friend like you, who is understanding as well as caring. As you know, I am fond of watching movies, therefore, I would like to share with you the name of my favourite Hollywood film, which is 'Eat, Pray, and Love' starring 'Julia Roberts.' I first saw this picture during my adolescence, and since then it is one of my best-liked films. This movie not only delivers a strong message about the importance of loving oneself, but it also motivates the viewers not to give up while facing challenging situations. Since life is uncertain, it is imperative for each one of us to love and nurture ourselves every single day. Also, the last part of the film was shot in Bali, which according to me, is one of the most beautiful places on this planet. As we both have similar preferences, I would want you to watch this film with your family or friends. Although the duration of this movie is long, it provides an in-depth understanding of the cultures of several countries, namely India, Bali, and Italy. Please stay in touch, and let me know how you feel about the movie. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Peter

Nowadays adolescents and young people tend to be more sedentary than in the past. Health science has proved that an inactive lifestyle can have various bad effects on both mental and physical health. For this reason many governments suggest families let their children move as much as they can, for example by introducing them to different kinds of sports. Sports projects are usually joined by schools and universities to introduce young people to new activities, hoping they'll like them and maybe start practising on a regular basis. Personally, I think these programs should be implemented in order to keep students moving. First of all, doing some exercise three times a week is the best way to move your body especially if your main everyday activity involves sitting for many hours over your books. As a matter of fact, students who don't do sports tend to get more distracted and are usually more isolated that others. There's also a higher risk of them developing a bad posture. Second of all, forcing students to do sports could be helpful for those who struggle making friends. Many lifelong friendships are usually born during adolescence thanks to sports activities. Especially in team sports people tend to create a bond with other players very easily. On the other hand, there are also students who struggle with the idea of moving their bodies. Sometimes, overweight people are ashamed of their bodies and their difficulties when it comes to moving around. For this reason, I would recommend universities and school to pay attention to the necessities of each student before forcing them to do sports. Perhaps they could include psychological help for young people who feel this is a bad thing for them. All in all, I would say that these programs could be very useful and effective only if carefully applied by considering all the factors and different aptitudes.

Nowadays we have so many opportunities to learn something new about jobs. There are different ways in which we could practice, the one I am talking about is the chance for students to be volunteers. I personally admire this method. There are many reasons behind the fact that this is a good initiative in teenagers' life. One of these is to be capable of earning money while you are studying. By doing this you can decide to save your money to pay for your future studies, at university or wherever you will decide to go and do. In addition, it is useful because you learn something about a new job and acquire skills you would have never imagined having, but above all, you help society by doing little things. In my opinion, this type of volunteering in high school should be spread to other countries, because it can also help students with school difficulties to graduate by simply doing something different that can rebalance their school grades. I am speaking about this because I have seen a lot of movies in which this method is often used and I would have liked to try it when I was a scholar. In conclusion, this is a good move because with one job the opportunities to graduate, help people and earn money are given to the students.

My town is small because it has 200 inhabitants. There are many restaurants. I ate dinner there with my family but I did not with my friend. There are two parks close to my home. The first park is called "Jun," there are not a lot of things, but we can go running. We are able to throw some rocks in the lake, it is a lot of fun. The city has no night time entertainment. We call it a dormitory city. I had been playing football with my friends. I have been running in the park in the morning, before work.

I think that we should not choose the way we live our lives. I think that a person should be able to choose the way he is living his life. I prefer to live a short but intense life than to live a long and boring one. In this moment because I am trying to change my work place I make lots of effort so I can have a very strict schedule so I have enough time to learn. This way I manage to learn in the morning and in the evening every day. It is very hard for me to wake up in the morning and to start learning for the IT web developer course. I think this investment in me is the best thing in my life and I really hope that in the near future I will have the possibility to change my life and also my life. I hope that in the near future I will find colleagues that are more open-minded, that are nicer then the ones I have now. I would be glad if I will be able to understand all the information that Sasha is teaching and maybe in the near future I will be strong and confident enough so I will change my life. Until then I prepare every day and I try to do my best to learn English and to understand the IT web developer course.

Hi Bell! How are you! You told me about your trip, so I decided to tell you about mine. I went with my teacher and my classmates to Alba-Iulia, a very beautiful town in Romania. We climbed the mountains, we made a campfire and we saw a lot of animals from the secret and scary forest, with big and terrifying trees. My birthday was on 27.08 and the camp started on 26.08 so they all sang me "Happy Birthday." I enjoyed this camp because the people were so happy and they could understand everything. I hope I will go there again! Kisses, Mary.

I prefer to sleep in a dark room and quiet room. This atmosphere is appropriate for deep sleep. There are hormones that are secreted from the body while people are sleeping. If people have good quality sleep, the hormones are able to be effective as well. When I feel tired, I would like to sleep in a proper room. This will make me feel fresh in the morning. On the other hand, sleeping with a small light and noise in the room can cause adverse consequences, for example, stress, cardiovascular disease and anxiety. Although some think that they do not mind sleeping in this environment, in my opinion they should change their sleeping habits.

My favorite season of the year is none. No, don't judge me. First, read my opinion. Think about it. Spring is a hateful time. All these birds and insects sing to find their partners. Besides, the pollen makes me sneeze. Last spring, I sneezed over a woman and her child. I remember that her glasses got dirty. Summer is hot, and that is the reason my skin gets irritated. It is horrible and painful, are hash and itch. All the time, I must use aloe. The fall or autumn, I don't like either. All the time, I must sweep billions and billions of tree leaves. Yes, like Sagan said. The winter always brings a cold. You can’t get up from bed. You only want to lie down. I remember a weekend where I was stuck between sheets.

Sleeping is one of the best human qualities and there are people who prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, while other individuals enjoy it with a small light on and don't mind noise or a loud song. I believe that I would rather sleep in a dark, small, and quiet room to rest the entire night and without bother. First off, to sleep well I need many things to make the room appropriate to rest.

It is an intriguing question: better a short but intense life or long but calm and 'grey', and with no bright colors ? I think that, even if it seems hard to decide, at a closer look maybe most people believe that they would prefer a short but intense life. And probably it is mainly for one reason: the intensity of the feelings that a totally involving experience carries with it, in a special way it brings on a time distortion. That is to say, time passes very slowly when you are going through a very intense experience. You remember every minute of the time passed, and every minute lasts as long as a day. This is a result from psychology science: time is not absolute but has a different duration from one person to another, with respect to his or her feeling of the time. Our mental processes enhance some situations, and they thus appear longer than other moments of poor mental activity. And those special situations, despite their real duration, are so impressed in our mind that they appear much longer in time, when we think about them. Finally, we can understand the common phrase "better a day as a lion than one hundred as a ship." It is the sensation of having spent intensively all the time in your hands with no seconds lost, that makes you happier. And we all would like to have a good time. A good time is not more time, but a better one.

I have heard that considering the young people who have a bad habit that may affect their health, universities and schools have set rules to force students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. For the sake of strengthening the physical and mental health of students, I agree with this latest policy, and my reasons are as follows. Firstly, many students are addicted to their own mobile phones. Although young people do not have the ability to control them by themselves, most students at school nowadays have their own phone. As a result, a lot of students do not sleep until midnight because of their phones, and it will make them energyless. If the school sets rules to force them to do sports it can help them stay away from mobile phones and improve their health condition. In addition, it can also enhance students' academic performance. According to a study, the students who do sports have better scores than those who stay at home. Secondly, doing sports regularly can help students make more friends, which is beneficial for their mental health. Many sports activities are a kind of test of teamwork, and through the progress of team working, the students can cultivate their ability of cooperating. For example, basketball, football, soccer, etc. The students can make true friends while they are fighting with their teammates together. After the sports activities they can also discuss the problems they have with their friends, which is really good for their mental health. Friends are important company for all students. On the other hand, schools cannot always force students to do sports. What is the most important is to make them love doing sports so that they will do sports activities regularly by themselves instead of others' enforcement. And that is the final purpose. To sum up, in my opinion, it is necessary that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. It could avoid the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle. But enforcement is not the final purpose, the schools should teach them to mix sports into their lives.

Nowadays, technology is increasing very quickly, especially for computers and tablets. These devices are becoming more and more popular, in particular the tablet, which has became a little laptop. It is really versatile and easy to carry around. A tablet is also used to read documents and books, so many people believe that this device will replace paper and books in the near future. It could be an advantage, using digital books will avoid a waste of paper, and it is a good thing for the environment. Moreover, digital books are just popular with young people, who are used to writing on a tablet. They use various applications to read the texts easily. However, many adults do not agree, they think that it is more difficult to focus on the text, and they believe that it is more tiring and boring than a real book. Finally, I think that tablets and computers couldn't replace books, because many people prefer paper, instead of watching a screen. On the other hand, it is a pleasure to turn over to the next page and touch the paper.

When we become adults, life changes forever. And all the things around us change, too. When we are children or teens, we almost always depend on our parents to do everything. We depend on even their money to buy simple things we want, or to go out on weekend nights. So, when we become adults, we need to look for a situation which allows us to grow up in every direction. Then, it's very interesting that university students, for example, already start working for their own resources. Some of them move away and live on their own when they go to university. At same time, there are others who live at home with their family in this period of life. I think that after a person gets older, it is better for her not to depend on anyone. People need to understand that they will not have their parent's protection for their whole life. Protection is very good (and even useful) during some years of childhood and teen age, but there is a moment in which we must learn to guide our own steps, because we won't have other adults to protect us for the rest of our lives. So, I believe that the best choice for university students when they go to University is trying to build their own academic lives on their own. If some extreme need situation happens, these students may ask their father to help them. Pay attention: I said this is acceptable only if extreme need occurs (illness or an accident for example). My idea about this has nothing to do with making students' lives difficult. Never. My idea is about how they can see how huge it is to achieve our goals, and how real life is hard out of our homes when we are older and we decide on having our lifestyle! Not always can children and teenagers imagine how heavy it is to work and to get things which parents do. It seems even everything our parents acquire falls from the sky. So, they may begin to understand soon that life is difficult, and the first difficulty starts when we go to university!

In my life, I have been studying English for almost twenty years. I sometimes wonder why I am obsessed with learning English. The answer is simple: I still need to learn English. When I started studying English, I was a junior high school student. Since then, I have studied English for three years in junior high school, another three years in high school, and four years in college. During these ten years, I have become able to read English essays with a dictionary. However, I am still not good at speaking and listening in English. Since graduating from college, I have continued to practise listening to English. Every day, on the commuter train to work, I listen to English news, and repeat the news in a whisper. If a simultaneous translation tool became available, I wouldn't need to learn English any more. I hope that day will come in the near future.

Telling the truth is indeed a great life skill, and it plays an integral role in the life of several individuals. It is recommended to be honest in life as it defines the character and moral values of each person. This essay intends to highlight the reasons why I think it is necessary to speak honestly throughout the life. To be honest is an excellent virtue of life, and some people are born with this innate quality, whereas others learn this skill from their families, or teachers. As this quality describes the social image of a person in society, therefore, it is essential to tell the truth in all circumstances in life. To demonstrate, since I absorbed various moral values such as honesty and punctuality from my father, it has always helped me to deal with challenging situations in a stronger way. Even though it is hard not to lie during tough times, it is recommended to communicate in an honest way as one can develop a bad habit of lying, which can have several detrimental effects on individuals, and society. People can, moreover, get involved in several troubles when they cheat on others. To illustrate, a close friend of mine was in the habit of telling lies, which negatively impacted my image in the college, and eventually, I decided to end up my friendship with her. Hence, it is prudent to tell the truth on all occasions as this trait is a building block of one's personality and image in the community. To conclude, it is vital to communicate in a fair and transparent way for the well-being of society. Furthermore, it helps people to be real and natural in their own ways.

Life expectancy is unpredictable and destined. If I was asked to choose between living a long calm life until 100 years old and living a short lifespan but much more intense, interesting, and fatigue, frankly, I would choose the former for some reasons below although some people like me in the teenage phase would like to have an intense life now. The first reason why I would prefer to live longer is to learn more knowledge about this world. The world is full of many interesting phenomena and principles, which deeply lures me to observe the change of the world with respect to politics, economy, art, science, cultures, etc. Besides, the process of change of knowledge and cultural and scientific phenomena may last so long that I have much time to learn much more about the principles of this world than ordinarily if I could live up to 100 years old. Additionally, the second reason why I prefer to live longer is related to my characteristics. I'm a little conservative, quiet, and slow - paced person compared to most of my peers so that I'm usually inclined to live in a slow tone of life like taking a stroll on the road for one afternoon, sitting on the balcony leisurely and seeing the pedestrians crossing by the roads, and having a tasty drinks in a coffee shop while reading travel magazines. Moreover, the most critical reasons for me to choose to live longer is my lovely family. If I have my own family, I 'm eager to accompany my dad, my mom, spouse, wife and children as long as I can. I would like to spend my rest of time taking care of them, watching them growing healthily, and allowing them to have their own families finally, which is the biggest satisfaction for my life. In general, after considering the above benefits compared to living in a short lifespan, I would prefer to live longer even though it may not be imaginable in my destiny.

Nowadays, I'm working in the office that is in a building on the 12th floor. I always work there, I feel really anxious because it seems there won't be a way to leave or get out of that room. Besides that, when there isn't any energy to support you, you'll have to go down the stairs. It would be terrible, mainly if you work on a high floor, like the 12th like me. As that space isn't so big, you'll have to allow for all the employees who work in that tiny place. In order to remove or increase the sounds, you'll have to create walls, that is, you'll spend more money if your company has a great deal of employees. For example, in my work, when someone tries to get in touch with other people by telephone or video chat, they need to change rooms to reduce the sound so that all the sounds, mainly other people by telephone or video chat, they need to change the room to reduce the sound so that all the sounds, mainly other subjects, are not received by person through the video or the line. There's another problem that no one is talking about which is the privacy. It depends on the meeting or subject, but if you need to talk about a specific thing with another person such as you are firing someone or you are talking about money, you won't have any privacy to talk about it. All of it is owing to lack of privacy that they don't have when they created the office.

In my opinion, always telling the truth is one of the fundamental ways to make and keep a good relationship with others. Even though everyone feels good about telling a lie, it is not good, because they must feel worthy when they notice it is not true. To apologize when you miss something is also important. People are not perfect. It is usual to make mistakes sometimes. So to apologize for the mistakes and how to recover them is very important. In business, always telling the truth and apologizing are very important for building and keeping a good relationship with a customer, because businesspeople always have a responsibility for something and they do not want to fail in their jobs. So they have to build and keep a good relationship with customers based on them. Even though there are difficulties in your business, it becomes easier once you can get a good relationship to continue to tell the truth and apologize for a mistake and recover it. Personally, I think that a good relationship makes people feel it's worth living and people are a member of a group. People may always think about their worth and the meaning of life. So it is very important for people to feel them. For the above reasons, I always think that always telling the truth is very important and the key to making good relationships with others and making a better life.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing regarding the new policy of the administration which restricts the usage of cellular phones on public forms of transport such as buses and metro trains as well as in public stores and eateries. Since the above news was published in the local newspaper, 'The Navbharat Times,' on 18th February 2022, I believe, it is both my right and duty to convey to the local authority of Noida that as a representative of this town, I am dissatisfied with the idea of making alterations to the existing policy of mobile usage. As per my understanding, if the local body makes any changes in the current system pertaining to the utilization of smart phones, it will lead to several detrimental effects on individuals and society. To commence with, since we all are aware of the fact that mobile phones have become a necessity in our lives because they not only provide us with the opportunity to speak with our family and friends, but they also help people to track their loved ones, particularly, the elderly and children of their family, therefore, the usage of cell phones cannot be restricted in terms of places and time. Secondly, people listen to music and read articles, or news on their phones while using public conveyances, which helps them to relax as well as to be aware of their surroundings, and, if the management makes the decision of altering the cellular phone policy, it will affect the common man negatively in various ways. Considering the above-mentioned situations, I request you to please reconsider your plan of making variations in the present guidelines of using cell phones on public transport and areas of common interest. Looking forward to receiving a positive response. Yours faithfully, Ben Peterson

Health is the most important thing in our life. Therefore, there is a proverb, " Health is wealth " . There are many reasons why I say this. Many people might think that wealth is better than health. So, they try to be wealthy. In fact, sometimes, they forget to take care of their health. They ignore it instead of taking care of this. Because they think it is not very important and so they neglect it. On the other hand, they forget they cannot do nothing if they are ill. They can't go wherever they want. Besides that, they can't eat what they like, and they can't work either. At that moment, some people realize that health is important. To sum up, we need to take care of our health. If so, we can live more happily even though we are not wealthy. Thus, I totally agree that it is more important to be healthy than to be wealthy.

Health, indeed, plays an important role in the life of all. In the contemporary era, youngsters, particularly the undergraduates, and students studying in schools are seen consuming fast food on a regular basis, and following an unenergetic style of living, which leads to several detrimental effects on their well-being and fitness levels. This essay intends to describe how health and wellness can be maintained by adopting a healthy, and an active routine. Moreover, it emphasizes the role of exercise and physical activities in improving the quality of life, hence, I concur with the idea that the youngsters should be urged to perform physical exercise a minimum of three times a week. As students are the future of our country, therefore, not only should they look after their physical health, but should also maintain their mental well-being. Playing outdoor games such as cricket, and tennis, or doing physical exercise, namely yoga, aerobics, and running can help young people be energetic and overcome several health-related problems. To begin with, it helps children to be active and full of energy throughout the day. As a result, they do not feel lethargic while studying, moreover, they look forward to performing their daily tasks with enthusiasm and ardour. To illustrate, because I started to exercise in my childhood, I lost the excess body weight, and, furthermore, I was able to concentrate better on my studies and score higher grades. Another reason why a healthy physical routine is important is because it assists youngsters to overcome health-related challenges, namely obesity, diabetes, and asthma. Furthermore, in comparison to medicines, exercise is a better way to build immunity and fight against diseases. For example, a recent study by Times has revealed that 70% of people suffering from diabetes can be cured if they imbibe a nutritious diet and perform physical activities an average of three times per week. Thus, sports as well as physical training play a key role in the lives of youth. To conclude, it is undeniably true that playing outdoor sports and doing physical exercise can support young people to overcome their health problems as well as to focus on their academic career in a better way. In my view, to exercise is a great way to boost immunity; in fact, it is the best way to be physically and mentally fit.

As life is important to all, there are some individuals who prefer life to be short and full of energy as well as intensity, whereas, the other class of individuals believe to live a long, and peaceful life. This essay intends to highlight the reasons why I think a serene and a calm approach is integral to living a healthy and long-lasting life. In the contemporary era, people not only are seen running after money and wealth, but are also seen becoming competitive against each other, particularly, against their friends and family members. As a result, they let go of their relationship and friendship with their near and dear ones as they give more priority to their economic status in society. Therefore, it is sensible to live in a serene environment such as in the countryside, where people show respect and gratitude towards each other. Furthermore, this helps them to develop stronger bonding among themselves and to help one another during emergencies. To illustrate, since my parents lived in a small town, they believed in the simplicity of life and valued their relationships with others. Moreover, they learned to be contented in their lives, and not to become money-minded. Secondly, adopting a calm and peaceful lifestyle helps individuals and society to be healthy in terms of their physical and mental well-being, and to enjoy a long-lasting life. In my understanding, it is better to live a stress-free life because stress and anxiety are the two main factors for all types of health-related problems, namely heart attacks, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels. For example, a recent study by Times has revealed that 70% of youth living in the metropolitan areas are suffering from hypertension due to their intense and busy lifestyle. Thus, it is important for people to adopt a passive lifestyle, which is beneficial for their health, and life. To conclude, as a complex and intense lifestyle could lead to several detrimental effects such as health and social problems in society, therefore, it is prudent to adopt a passive lifestyle to safeguard the interest of human race.

My favorite indoor activity is yoga because it involves meditations and it helps to keep my mind up and I seize an opportunity to meet my inner peace. So, the last time I did yoga was yesterday at night with some friends of mine. This experience was amazing and different because doing yoga with other people is a good opportunity to live and share thoughts with the others.

Working in an open or closed space. Which one is the best? Working in privacy will increase the labour performance or an open space should bring up the worker's responsibility. In this essay I will argue which is the better solution, the benefits and prejudice. Working in a closed space would help the workers focus and also with their privacy. It is really annoying when we are on the phone and nearby there is someone listening to what I´m saying. The prejudice I note is help wouldn't be provided because of the isolation. Furthermore it wouldn't be or can be difficult to share important doubts. Working in an open space could bring benefits in the sight we can watch if the worker is working or just surfing on the net. How long is that worker in his coffee break? But for the worker it can be an opportunity to share and clarify some doubts or fears. As a conclusion, both kinds of space to work in have benefits but also harm and they should be analyzed for which will be the better for company results.

I sleep in a room with a small light. The room must be quiet. I get up three times a night to go to the bathroom. I have a small bladder. When I was young, I always got up every night to go to the bathroom. It was a habit. I wanted to break this habit but it didn't work. I have a big window in my room so I need a blind that blocks the light out tightly. If there is a little noise, it wakes me up. After that, I can't wait to go back to sleep.

Obesity is a big headache for public health and it is necessary to educate people about this matter. However, forcing people to do exercise could be counterproductive. First of all, we must encourage a more active lifestyle and introducing a subject in school and universities seems to be the right choice. Younger generations will be more educated about their health and, as a consequence, could raise awareness among their family members and everyone will benefit. But, at the same time, forcing young people to do exercise when they do not want to, or feel embarrassed about it, could create a different impact: generating distance from physical activity. Kids and young people are ruthless and not everyone is good at sports. We must be careful because bullying is also a big public issue in our schools. We do not want to create another issue in our schools. I think we should encourage a healthier lifestyle for children and university students, but this cannot be done by forcing them to do sports activities. We should find different ways to transform sport into an attractive activity and, as a consequence, have a healthy lifestyle. Increasing college credits for those who do sports in schools could be a great advantage, for example. Another example could be to change the type of food we give to children in school casinos for a healthier one. This would help to change habits in children, to try and get to know new foods. As for college students, I can think of having healthy casinos and restaurants on campus, offering a variety of cheap and fast healthy food for them. Another idea that comes to my mind is reducing college debt fees for those who have played some kind of sport during their college years. That could motivate sports activities among students. There are many ways to raise awareness of a more healthy lifestyle for young people, forcing them to do sports shouldn't be one of them.

Hi, Last week, my classmates and I went on a school trip to the national museum. We went there to study history and find out information about it for our class project. The museum was large. We came across many interesting historic and cultural objects, like turbans, swords, and some other objects like crowns of former rulers, we also saw a mummy there, next to each part or thing in the historical museum there's some information about what happened and things. I enjoyed seeing so many amazing things. As you know, the museum is famous for many amazing things, like our culture, traditional food, past things, stories, etc. And the best part was that we got to see the great artworks about our traditions. At the end of the lesson, the teacher asked us questions to understand what we had learned. We took notes, shared our ideas, and did a quiz. We also did great jobs on our projects. They were very informative.

My favourite season of the year is fall because during this season the days get shorter and temperatures start to drop. In some places rainfall increases, many plants make seeds that will become new plants in spring. Some animals grow thicker fur to get ready for the cold winter. Others gain weight to prepare for a deep sleep called hibernation. Also various cultures celebrate bountiful harvests with an annual festival. Thanksgiving is a good example for the USA and Ocktober Fest for Europe. However, where I live we do not have seasons literally I live nearly half of the world, in fact, the climate is not easy to predict because when you view your weather app it says it is a sunny day, but no, you are witnessing a deluge that really ruins your day. Another thing is the high temperature, you sweat all day.

I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, but if this situation doesn't happen, I don't worry or become stressed. Regarding noise, it is different, as my sleep is so light that some noise can wake me. Because of that I try to sleep with my room's door and the window closed. Once I've woken up, I don't have a problem going back to sleep, but it puts me in an uncomfortable condition because anything can make me wake again. I've read about sleep and try to understand how it works. I've learnt that there are two types of sleep, short and long sleep. Short sleep is the most important because it put us in a totally inactive state and long sleep, even being more extensive, doesn't rest our brain and body totally. To have a short and deep sleep is necessary to have a part of long sleep, before and after, during the sleep.

What I like about Write and Improve. First, it is a great idea. The service is wonderful to use for practising and improving your writing, in addition, it is free. Second, they are using artificial intelligence to correct each paper very fast. In third place, the exercises are funny or interesting. It’s a great website and I love working with it at any time and any place. It’s nice to have the emails with suggestions and advice. Finally, the exercise with images is interesting. What I didn’t like about Write and Improve. Just one thing, it would be helpful in the W&I feedback if it was a little more precise about the mistake. For instance, the system would show the problem. I would recommend my classmates to try it. In fact, I have already written about Write and Improve to some friends. By the way, thank you for your website, it’s a great idea.

My reasons for learning English are first to obtain an international job where I could speak English full time because my current job is a joke. They require a bilingual engineer, but I have never talked in English and my manager, I guess, really doesn't talk in English. Second, English is spoken around the world and when I travelled to Europe I used my English and I felt confident and learned some words to use in the correct way. Third, English is simple and you can learn fast. Fourth, when you understand English you can expand your entertainment, for example, right now I could watch movies and series in English because Netflix does not stream in Colombia, only in the USA, or launches series in other countries and not Colombia. Fifth, I wanna meet new people around the world, for example, currently I use the Cambly platform to speak with a native speaker. There I hear stories from my teacher about other experiences and perspectives.

The use of computers and tablets could be implemented at school. Nowadays, teaching at university and school is changing. In my view, it is better to implement new forms than to maintain traditional methods. Educators have to implement measures in order to adapt to our present. In addition, if students are using computers and tablets at home in order to learn, why can't they use them in class? Furthermore, it isn't worth memorizing a lot of knowledge that you can find on the internet. It is high time educators tackled this problem, and they would have to change their mind. As a result, it would mean investing more money in new devices, although it would be cheap in the future. But on the other hand, educators would have more work in class if they had to control the use of the internet in class. To sum up, in my view it is vital to renew some rules at school.

Autumn is my favourite season of the year. And it's not only because my birthday is in September! I have always had a deep connexion with nature. It's the beginning of the end, the start of the cold days, the opening of the Christmas season, and the new things to come. In autumn, in France, we begin the new academic year, so it's the moment to think about your future, and your dreams, and prepare to achieve your goals and ambitions. Autumn means the fall of golden and brown leaves, the tiredness of animals preparing for the hard season coming, the world slowing down, the trees revealing their naked trunks, and the leafy clothes which fly away. It's the time to spleen, to dream, to walk alone, and play in the wind. Memories of past years come harder in this period, often memories from our childhood or our young teenage years. For me, autumn is deeply linked to faeries and a magic world. These days I dream of being a fox or a wolf, and wandering in a forest, in search of a little door to the magic land.

Dear Chris, It was very exciting to hear that you are able to come along with my family to the museum. We will get there by car. Be aware that the car ride will be 50-60 minutes long. You can find plenty of interesting things at the museum. For example, you can see ancient fossils, learn about animals and their life cycles, and guess if they are mammals or reptiles. Additionally, you can also find out if they are warm-blooded animals or cold-blooded animals. You will need to bring a plastic bag, your jacket, and a notebook, along with a pencil. That would be everything that will come in handy. I believe that we will have such a brilliant day spending time with each other! Kind regards, George Dishwasher

It is always important to learn to speak a foreign language, no matter whether it is in the past, present, or future. If you have a second language, you have a different perspective on life, because when you learn a new language you really need to get involved in the culture to understand idioms, know people and the local customs, and to have other advantages. I guess in the past learning a new language maybe was difficult because only the upper classes had professors or classes to learn things, but if you were poor maybe you acquired a new language escaping from your town and facing life in a place where you did not have any idea of how you communicate. But when you learn thing in your own way, almost in all cases you have more knowledge to face a test or improve your quality of life and open new opportunities.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I don’t think so. Of course, tablets and computers are very useful. Think about it, all your notes and your information are in the cloud or on your computer. All our data one way or another is partially or completely in the computer’s memory. But I doubt they will completely replace books made of paper. Because books you can read any time, any place, including without electrical energy. You can make your notes in your books, it's so simple, just write. The advantage is no one can see your notes, and your notebook does not need upgrading constantly. Anyway, in my opinion, the best thing about reading books is that they don’t hurt your eyes. If you read the screen after a few hours your eyes will hurt. Never do my eyes hurt when I read a book, obviously with adequate light.

Hi Matt, Thanks very much for your email. It was great to hear from you again. Well, my school has more than 1,000 students, and the buildings are very large. I got lost a few times at the beginning of the semester! But it's a lovely school. The other students in my class are very friendly, and most of the teachers are not too strict. There are several clubs to go to after school. I'm going to join two of them - the basketball club and the art club. I think I'll enjoy them. I have found a nice web to improve my English writing skill! It's Write and Improve, I have used this web for 4 months and my writing skills have improved a lot, it is from A2 to B1 and sometimes it's up to B2 and C1. I think that you should try it one time too, it lets you know how good your skills are, and what you do wrong and you should try Grammarly too, it fixes your writing, fixes your grammar and also your words. After Grammarly, you will see that your text is perfect, it's not bland any more and also looks Take care and see you soon.

My reasons for learning English I have three reasons for learning English. First of all, there are many authors whose works are not translated into Spanish but into English. Especially Greek, Roman, and European ones. On the other hand, American doctrinal authors are very important to read. Secondly, I love travelling to the United Stated and hearing the people speak, answering the questions of the immigration police, going to McDonald’s and asking for an order of hamburgers, potato chips, and a cold Coke, and walking and seeing the advertising. I forget, I like to watch TV shows in English. For some reason, I like that. In third place, I hope someday in the future to work for a foreign university online. I know a lot about Kelsen’s theory of law. I know maybe it is a silly idea, but who knows? I hope one day to teach online about this author.

Write and improve is a fantastic application to improve my English. I have been using it for 4 months. In this time, I completed one workbook at the beginner level and that was enjoyable because I remembered all my grammar classes. And now I do workbooks at the intermediate level, and I can say my confidence when I talk and write English content has increased and I do not use a dictionary every time. However, the Write and Improve application could improve its functions and feedback to users because no native speaker can identify the differences between American or British English, and this platform only has British English. Maybe the student could select in which language the application shows menus and IA to correct activities. Because of lack of money I don't use a PRO mode or VIP mode. Maybe when you have a guide like a teacher's feedback, you will have more information, but in my opinion, it's not necessary if you have classes. Obviously, I recommend Write and Improve, it's free and you can really feel and watch your progress.

Hey Sammie! What is your favourite movie? Mine is "Pirates of the Caribbean"! I know, it is a really famous one. But everything in the first part is so amazing! The costumes, to begin with! Have you seen their costumes? Since I've watched this movie, I have had an obsession with the 18th century! Especially the costume of Jack, the main character - and so far my favourite! Secondly, the story plot! It's basic, but so entertaining! There are puns and jokes at every single moment. And, last but not least, the actors and actresses! The casting is so wonderful! Orlando Bloom as a young dumb smith. Keira Knightley as a brave and fighting aristocrat. Johnny Depp as... himself, but in a pirate way! A bunch of marvellous actors for a marvellous movie ! (I didn't like the next parts!) I'm sure you will like this movie, dude. You like action and history, adventure tales, and all that pirate stuff, and above all, you're in love with Keira! This movie has marked me. And believe me, you'll be too!

Hey Jimmy! Last week, I went to a concert. And, believe me, it was fantastic! It was Indochine who performed, and they were marvellous! When I saw, three months ago, that they have to produce near to my town, I didn't wait a minute more and rushed to their website to buy tickets! It was pretty expensive, but as they're an old group, I think it will be one of their last tours, and as they're my favourite band, I have to see them before they finish. Do you know Indochine? I'm sure you do! It's a French pop-rock band. They are old because they debuted in the 80s. Nikola Sirkis is the leader, the creator, and the main singer-composer of the band. He mostly writes about political and controversial topics, like sex, racism, homophobia, and non-binarity... It's why I'm such a fan! So, during the concert, I was a little disappointed by Nikola's voice (the singer and leader). But, as he's 65, I forgive him easily. The other members were very good, and the show was incredible. They are known in France to be stage animals, and now I can confirm this!

There is no shortage of opinion on educational methods. Some people believe digital devices, such as computers or tablets, should be used instead of paper books in schools and universities. As far as my perspective is concerned, I agree with this statement. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. In this regard, I will discuss how new educational instruments could contribute to a better educational comprehension, and also, how they would have significant impacts on the protection of the environment. The aforementioned justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, technology has constructive results for the quality of education. By using new devices, like tablets, students can have great access to various databases whilst they are attending a classroom. These databases can provide students with holistic information on every possible topic that could be presented by a lecturer in a class room. If they did not have this possibility to use such useful appliances in a classroom, they would be deprived of an opportunity to gain deep and increased knowledge of issues. Besides, these instruments make the teaching process more accurate and comprehensive. In other words, learning through new tools presents better pedagogical outcomes. Secondly, a shift from using traditional books to taking advantage of new digital devices means that the number of trees that should be cut every year to produce books will be lessened dramatically. In other words, if we increased the number of the electronic devices in schools or universities, it would result in a situation in which we would consume less paper. This fact reveals that there is a negative correlation between these two things: the more digital devices, the fewer trees that need to be cut. Therefore, this policy has a positive environmental effect in itself. To put it in a nutshell, any replacement of paper books with digital devices should be considered as a fruitful decision. As I explained above, I fully support this idea. In this regard, I discussed how this measure would make teaching easier and learning more beneficial. Moreover, I stated that this policy would have environmental impacts which are indispensable. Consequently, in my personal point of view, books should be replaced with new tablets and computers.

It goes without saying that the impact of video games on children's lifestyle has been significant, and it is something parents need to learn how to deal with. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. When it comes to new technology, there is no doubt it has a great impact on our current lifestyle. For better or worse, we all live in a technological world, where video games have an important role, especially among children. No wonder there must be some beneficial effects on children from the fact that they get to control such devices. However, the negative impact, in my humble opinion, should not be underestimated. To start with, I would like to mention some positive aspects of that matter. The way I see it, video games can provide children with technological knowledge. For instance, video games set in a specific historical moment can teach them how life was at that moment, and all the events that occurred. Nevertheless, it is a fact that other less productive topics are normally chosen when it comes to playing, such as war or racing. On the other hand, the overuse of video games and technological devices, in general, is making children lose their social skills and, what is more, it creates addiction. Besides, in accordance with some studies, playing video games is replacing face-to-face contact. Had it not been for that last point, it would not be wrong to think that video games can be productive for children. Nevertheless, the reality is very different. Children spend more time on their own and playing video games than they actually do with real people like their parents or friends. Last but by no means least, I would end by bringing focus to the fact that, even though we cannot live while rejecting technology and how relevant it is in the current world, parents ought to control what their kids do and how much time they spend doing so.

The series talks about a war between old gods and modern gods. The old ones are gods like "Thor" and the modern ones are gods of technologies. The script is interesting because it discusses human behaviour through gods and makes them seem like a normal person. I thought the name of a main old god, Wednesday, was funny.

There is no debate on the utmost importance of practical knowledge in different languages. Almost all people believe that nowadays, the ability to communicate in at least one language other than one's native language is indispensable. From my personal perspective, I agree with this statement. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. Speaking foreign languages is essential to find a prestigious job, and also, it is a useful means to converse with people all around the world. These aforementioned justifications will be elaborated more in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, the world of business is an interrelated phenomenon and if you think of having a worldwide market, you will have to interact with foreigners. In addition, no one can dismiss the fact that the current level of import or export in an international sphere, requires actors to command multiple languages. On the other hand, when it comes to individuals, the same is true. It has been shown by scientific statistics that those who know more than two languages, have a significant opportunity to find jobs with higher wages. Hence, the ability to speak different languages seems to be inevitable. Secondly, there are numerous languages in the world. If you knew several, you would be able to make more bonds and friendships. Besides, knowing various languages other than the maternal tongue, contributes to your ability to travel all around the world and discover things and gain unbelievable unprecedented experiences. Therefore, by speaking a second or third language, you will be able to discover many new places on your own. Otherwise, if one does not consider it as an impossible, it will be very hard to travel abroad. To put it in a nutshell, language has become a necessary instrument to make relationships, to find a better job, and even enjoy your life. With the current trajectory in international relations among states and nations, the capability to have a high degree of proficiency in different languages, such as English, is vital. In this essay, I delineated two explanations in which the necessity of learning foreign languages is proven. Not only do job prospects make it a prerequisite for a professional career, but also ordinary communication with people around the world, through social networks for instance, will not be possible without.

There is no shortage of opinions on prosperity or happiness. In this regard, there is a famous dilemma on whether health or wealth has a priority over the other. From my personal perspective, I invariably opt for health. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. In this essay I will explain how health is important; and also, I will draw attention to drawbacks of wealth. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, health, either mental or physical, is the most valuable gift in a life. Without having a healthy body, no one can enjoy his or her life. In addition, to the extent that you benefit from health, you can flourish in other aspects of your life. Should you have a healthy life, then you will be able to foster your talents, including in sport or even in your academic career. Therefore, health has a great contribution in life and will result in a better performance in any other field. Without health, you probably have to consume a considerable amount of energy, financially or mentally, to regain your favourable condition. Secondly, wealth is important, but there is always a limit. Money has its own negative and positive consequences. Although its positive impacts are outweighing the cons, there are still some disadvantages. For instance, a great amount of money will lead to anxiety. Scientists have been scrutinizing the repercussions of wealth on mental health. The result of their survey was significant and surprising. It has been observed by psychological experts that money has ramifications on mental health as it contributes to a higher degree of distress. Thus, money or financial independence is something that everyone tries to reach. Nevertheless, it is not impeccable and may raise unintended problems. To put it in a nutshell, health is more important than wealth. If you have money without a healthy mind or body, you will have no choice but to spend your money to recuperate. In this essay, I tried to demonstrate certain issues that prove the significance of health versus wealth. I discussed the effects of health in general: to enjoy a happy life and to develop a vast range of traits. Moreover, I delineated some ramifications of wealth on human health. For the sake of a conclusion, I would like to emphasize that health is vital to benefit from life.

There is no shortage of opinions on the negative or positive impacts of television. In this regard, many people are of the opinion that TV programs can be useful to learn new things, alongside the fact that they are mostly for entertainment. From my personal perspective, I agree with this statement. In this essay, I will discuss that TV programs can deliver shows in which the pedagogical units of schools could be covered. Also, I will delineate that television has a great influence on children, who can learn many new things from its programs. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, the great majority of television audiences are youngsters who are students at schools. In addition, it has been reckoned that pupils spend three hours per day on watching TV programs. Thus, there is a significant opportunity available to authorities in order to take the best possible advantage of this situation. If pedagogical complementary multimedia units are delivered through TV programs, students will be encouraged to spend more of their time on fruitful programs. Therefore, television could be employed as a means to broadcast certain teaching courses in an intricate and effective manner. Secondly, pupils are fascinated by TV. Scientists have been pondering the influence of TV broadcasting programs on youngsters, and the result reveals that materials broadcast by television linger for a longer period of time than those which were presented through traditional school classes. In this regard, if TV were used as a means to develop students' knowledge on matters related to their course, they would face a situation in which they could deepen their understanding of relevant issues that could not be developed at schools. Hence, we can exploit children's interests toward television to provide them with comprehensive and conclusive information related to their courses. To put it in a nutshell, TV can provide amusement, as well as education. In this essay, I examined the possibility to use TV as an instrument to teach kids in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, I articulated the fact that young people who are attending schools can have a profound enthusiasm to follow certain teaching lessons through TV programs. Consequently, the utmost effectiveness of television should not be neglected. TV could crack open an opportunity to provide young people with essential pedagogical programs in a manner that appears to be more favorable to them.

Hello, I like to sleep with lights off and without noise because sometimes if there is noise I can´t sleep very well and it takes me a while to fall asleep, I prefer to sleep using my phone until I fall asleep and when I am relaxed. I like to be on social networks while I am in bed, I also like to sleep in a comfortable bed because it is good for my back.

Which is more important: health or assets? This is a very difficult question. In the first place, are the two comparable? I cannot choose one or the other. I need both. I am greedy. On one hand, even if I alone am healthy, I will not be happy. I have a family and I want to protect their health. To do that, I need some assets. In today's society, it costs money just to go to the hospital. On the other hand, even if I have assets, I cannot enjoy them if I am not healthy. For example, if I was bedridden, it would make no difference whether I have assets or not. Health cannot be bought with money. After all, health and assets are probably not two separate issues. Health is a prerequisite for utilising assets and assets are a prerequisite for a healthy life. Hence I want both health and wealth.

Hello Billal, How are you? During the last week I went to a small touristy city with my class colleagues and it was amazing. The city was built in a period of Brazilian imperial time and the constructions are almost all from this time.

I do not prefer any kind of light or ambience to sleep. I can sleep in the middle of the day or in the complete dark. But I often sleep with a little light entering through my window. The light comes from the public lights on the street. I like a little light because I can see where I am and the things that are surrounding me. On the other hand, I can understand the people that sleep in the dark, that could give a peaceful sensation, something necessary to sleep well.

I usually sleep with a small light on in a completely silent room. However, I don't mind if the room is dark and noisy, when I am tired and sleepy, which happens almost every day, I can sleep in any condition. But the thing is entirely different when I have insomnia. When that happens, I need a quiet room. Even so, that's not a problem because I don't sleep alone and the person who is by my side always needs silence so they can sleep, then the room is always quiet.

The art of learning music When I went to school, I didn't study music, because we did not have a music teacher. I think that we need the opportunity to learn music and to play an instrument is very important, because children could develop their talent. However, there are many students without talent or vocation but they choose to study music although they are not good at this. For instance, I liked to play the flute and the guitar in high school, but today I can't learn because I don't have time. For this reason, I believe studying music should be required at schools. Moreover, it is a beautiful way to give knowledge of the art to children. I love music, and I would like my son to study music. He likes to play the drums, and I think that is his talent.

When I was taking a technical course, me and other students were in charge of choosing a place for us to go and we chose a dog rescue center, which we called a kennel. After the choice we had to get there on foot, because we didn't have a car that would allow us to get there quickly. After a long walk we arrived at the kennel, which was near a hill, when we arrived at the place we delivered rations and cleaning materials to clean the kennel. The part that I liked the most was the walk, even though it was very tiring, it was also a lot of fun.

I live in a town surrounded by mountains and hills and it is very nice to see the changes in this type of weather in this season It is amazing when you can see the changes in people with the season, it reminds me of how nature affects us. We are one. When I walk through the streets I see children playing and having fun with each other and their parents only have to keep an eye on them. If you pay attention, even the animals are more active and wild in nature and I know this because I often walk in the mountains and I can perceive that kind of energy in nature.

Hello Alex! Thank you so much for inviting me to your party this Saturday! I really appreciate it, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go this time. I know you were excited about this party, so please accept my apologies, The reason why I can't go is because I have to leave for the airport to catch a flight to Canada to visit my grandmother for her birthday. I haven't visited her for 3 years, so I figured I could make it to her birthday this year to finally be able to get her a present and celebrate with her. And since the flight is really early I won't be able to go since your party is in the afternoon, and not earlier. I'm very sorry I can't make it to your party, and I want to make it up to you, so I suggest another day when we could meet, a day when we are both free and able to talk properly to each other without any events in the way. I hope you can forgive me for not going to your party, and that you take into consideration my suggestion. I hope to see you very soon, bye!

As you probably known, I lived with my family in Ipatinga, Minas Gerais before moving to Campinas, São Paulo. It's been a long time since I arrived in this city, about 6 months, and I miss my family very much. For that reason, I'm going to visit my family this Friday and I'll stay there for about 14 days. In Minas Gerais there are many typical dishes, such as hominy, rice pudding, and beans with pork. If you want I can bring back some of these foods, I'm sure you'll like Minas Gerais food. I plan to come back in two weeks on Monday. If you don't have any commitments, why don't we go to the movies?

Hi Alex, I'm so sorry, but I'm not going to make it to your party this Saturday. My flight was set for Fiday, but the company canceled and I had everything sorted out, but I couldn't book another flight on time, the other ones available are on Sunday. There is another company which has a flight on Friday at 8 AM but it's way too expensive for me, I can't afford it. Recently, I was in a car accident and I was feeling a lot of pain in my back, and I went to a doctor's appointment and it happened to be a severe injury and I need to rest for my full recovery. That means no parties for me for a really long time, I hope you accept my sincere apologies.

This Saturday I have to meet with Sarah, you know her, I have spoken to you a lot of times about her. Finally, I got to ask her out and she said yes to me. I don't believe it yet, I was too jumpy when I said to her that we were seeing each other on Saturday and I forgot your party, and as you will understand I need to go on this date. The next day, on Sunday, we can meet and I am sure that we have many things to speak about.

I've never met his parents before and I don't want to give them a bad impression about me, so I can't miss that dinner. We could meet on Sunday afternoon. I'll be in the city centre to do some shopping and I'd be very pleased if you decided to join me. To apologise and be forgiven, may I promise I will offer you an ice cream?

From: me To: Alex Subject: party on Saturday My dear friend, I am sending this e-mail to you only to thank you for the invitation to the party next Saturday. You are a great friend, we have known each other for many, many years, and I also know that you would never forget to invite me to this important moment. We are almost brothers, and I know that this event is important to you. In spite of this, I am using this virtual space to say that I will not be present at this important moment of your life. Please, forgive me, because I even would like to participate in this moment by your side. I'm so sorry for this, and I will explain the reason I will not be there, and I hope you understand me... During this year, almost every weekend, I have been to several parties (including four or five with you, right?). However, last month I decided to dedicate part of my life to learning about money. I am receiving financial education, and now this is my passion. I have demonstrated a great interest in it. I have classes on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, usually at night (two hours each class, at 7:00 p.m.). So, it will be impossible to be at your party. These classes are very important, because they are changing my point of view on money, finances, emotional intelligence, personal growth and several other issues which can change our lives forever. I bought classes for an entire year, and their prices were very high. We can say that it was an investment in my life. My focus at this moment is acquiring my financial freedom, because I intend to retire when I am 45. I know this may not justify my absence at your event, but I hope you forgive me. Soon, I will be free again to be at other events, and I want you to comprehend me. It means that, for a while, I don't have any idea about when the next opportunity will be to be at this kind of event. Please, forgive me, my friend. I sincerely hope that you will be successful with your event next Saturday. Best regards,

Dear Alex, I am writing this email to apologise to you that I cannot go to your party on Saturday afternoon. This is because I am going to visit my grandmother's house in another city next weekend. The following Saturday is my grandmother's birthday, so a family gathering will take place at her house. My cousins and I are planning to show Thai musical instruments to surprise her on her 80th birthday. That is the reason why I cannot miss this special event. I am grateful for your kindness and thank you for your invitation to your party. I plan to have a party at home during summer break. If you are available, I hope that you are able to come and join us. It will take place on Saturday 9th June. I am looking to have a meeting with you because I would like to assign you to be the master of ceremonies. Hope to see you at my party. Por

Dear Alex, About that meeting, erm.., I'm sorry I won't be able to come. Because my mom doesn't want me to play outside, she said that this is the time of the year I graduate, and I must stay at home to learn more to be ready for the graduation task. We are all sixth graders, and this task is necessary for our whole life. My mom doesn't want me to go out; if I go out, she'll kill me! So, I'm so sorry, but I can't come. Would you like it if we had a party later? My mom said that when we finish our task, she'll be happy to welcome all of you to our house to have a party! But it has to be after the lesson. Would you mind coming? I'll get all our classmates and teachers. Maybe on June 17th? Are you OK with that? If so, just please let me know. Reply soon! Your friend

It is of the utmost importance to be a trustworthy person. The majority of people believe that on no account should someone tell a lie. From my personal perspective, I confirm the aforementioned statement. This is my firm belief, based on two plausible reasons. In this essay, I will explore the main advantages of telling the truth. Furthermore, I will denote how a lie could ruin the credibility of an individual. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, honesty is one of the significant traits. In all cultures, religious and cults, being honest is robustly recommended. Furthermore, all poets, social thinkers, as well as philosophers highlight the necessity of telling the truth. Importantly, they delineate that this general rule has no exception. In other words, under no circumstances, should the truth be dismissed. If someone had concealed a truth, they would have continued to add lies in order to prove the primary fallacious statement. Therefore, as it has been mentioned in Quran, the holy book of Muslims, salvation is nothing but in truth. Hence, by telling the truth, you may help yourself to go through difficult situations. Secondly, lies can destroy the reliability of a person. It is highly accepted as a social norm that decent people, who eagerly believe in their integrity, avoid telling something groundless. To make it less grand, if an individual deliberately made an erroneous claim or distorted a fact, or intentionally tried to cover an act up, whatever it could be, his or her authenticity would be damaged, as the truth will finally reveal itself. If it is the case, in similar situations, even with insisting on truth, barely will it be feasible for audiences to trust an infamous liar. Thus, never do we have to invoke to misinformation. To conclude, truth will invariably prevail in all possible conditions. It is like a shed light which eradicates the darkness of lies. Accordingly, no one can hide a lie for a long period. Consequently, we will always adhere to truth in order to be an honest person and to keep ourselves credible in the eyes of our relatives.

Hey Alex, Thank you for your invitation. I wish I could come to this party to meet our friends. It's been very long since graduation day, we have not had any opportunities to meet each other. I miss our classmates and our memories of student life a lot and it would be such an exciting party. Unfortunately, I'll have to go to Vietnam this Firiday to resolve some important business, so it's before your day of the party. The first crucial business is the process of closing my company in Vietnam because finally I decided to settle down with my family in America. Although I will be unable to go there, I still want to contribute some money to our class fund and ask you to say 'hi' to everyone and talk to them about my absence. It's very hard for you to organise this party alone. But there is no chance to delay my trip. Finally, I hope everyone will have a fantastic party. Speak soon, Hunters

Dear Alex, Thank you very much for inviting me to your birthday party. I still recall your last birthday celebration, and that was a mesmerizing occasion to meet your friends and family. I wish you a pleasant birthday. Unfortunately, due to an important official meeting, I won’t be able to make it. I cannot believe how fast time goes by. Your last birthday occasion seems to have been just a few months ago! I wish I could have also been present to congratulate you on your birthday in person this year. Unfortunately, my office will hold an annual board meeting that usually takes the whole day. We invite some key personnel to the discussion; my presence is significant considering my role. There is no way I can skip the meeting or leave early. Regrettably, your birthday is on the same day. However, I would like to meet you next Saturday and give you your birthday gift. So save my birthday cake until then. I look forward to meeting you soon and wish you a delightful birthday. Yours, Mahtab

Hello Alex, I wanna apologize for not going to your party, turns out I bought some tickets to travel on vacation, and the trip will be on Friday and I will be back in two weeks. I am gonna go to Hawaii with my wife. We will go to the volcanoes and the beaches. We will also go to the jungle, I heard that you can do expeditions and climb. After the trip, when I return to the country I am gonna go to your house to meet and we do something, we decide there. Say hello to you parents and tell your mom that we will go soon and tell her to save me the cookies that she makes. Tell your brother that when I get there, we will play with the PlayStation 5 and tell him to practise because I have been practising and I am better than before.

Hi Alex, I hope your holidays are going well. I have just received your invitation for your party this Saturday afternoon. I'm so confused and disappointed because, as you know, I would have loved to be present, but that will not be possible. I'm very sorry and I sincerely apologise. Indeed, as I told you, I'm in Paris to prepare my new accommodation for the start of the classes in September. I'm there for 6 days, from Monday to Saturday. But, I will be available on my return to Sens. Instead of meeting each other this Saturday, we could organise something for the next Saturday. We could go to the beach and spend the afternoon there. It could also be fun to invite someone else to join us. What are your thoughts about that ? I'm waiting for your answer. Thanks again for having thought of me. Best regards, Kate

Hello dear Alex, Firstly, I would like to thank you for the amazing invitation to your party next Saturday afternoon. So, I am writing this email because I am sorry about my absence at this party as I am not able to be present on this day. Also, the main reason I can't attend the gathering is that I will accompany a patient to the hospital on the same day and time and it is a huge coincidence. Finally, I know this party is important for you and I am not able to be present. Other than that, I would like to suggest meeting each other next week to keep up to date with our lives and have a drink. To sum up, I would like to apologise to you by means of this email because I hope you understand my situation and we can combine a party to replace that one. Best wishes, David

Dear Alex, Firstly, I wonder that is everything on the wheel on your life. I hope you have achieved everything that you want. Whatever... Getting back to the main issue. I'm very pleased with your invitation, but I have some problems with my family, especially with my father, so I will not be able to attend that party. I am so sorry that I have to reject this invitation. I would like to be there and enjoy myself with you. We would have drank some alcohol and got drunk at the end of the night. And maybe I would have seen Lisa, you know I am interested in her... Please take care of her, I don't want to lose her. As you know that last thing is only a joke.. I feel upset, but I will not join you. Thank you for your invitation. Good luck. I am chomping at the bit to see you.

There is no shortage of opinions on negative lifestyles. Many people believe that due to the harmful impacts of sedentarism on mankind's well-being, all educational institutions, including universities and schools, must make physical exercise compulsory. The proponents of this idea recommend that these sporting activities should be taken on every other day. From a personal point of view, I agree with the above-mentioned statements. In fact, this is my firm belief, for which I will provide two plausible reasons to prove my perspective. Firstly, I will address the negative ramifications of inactive lifestyles on health from a scientific context. Secondly, I will explore the benefits of an active lifestyle on mental robustness. All the aforementioned will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. To begin with, undoubtedly, there are severe consequences on health which are driven by a sedentary lifestyle. In other words, our methods of living will directly affect our medical conditions. It has been established through certain empirical research that people who are not active during the day are at risk of having chronic physical conditions. For instance, if exercise has been eliminated from your daily schedule, you would be plagued with heart diseases. These medical disorders are in negative correlation with the extent of physical activities. Thus, if someone had been seated for a long time, in a long run, he would have gotten physical abnormalities. Therefore, doing sport and dedication to an active lifestyle is associated with health-strength. Secondly, on no account should we consider the impacts of sedentarism are limited to medical health. Its effect and consequences are beyond that. Apparently, a sedentary lifestyle has significant effects on mental health. The statistical findings delineate that those who benefit from vacancies in which they have to be active, for example police officers or doctors who should invariably be rushed off their feet, feel happier than others with sitting jobs. In other words, you will feel more enthusiasm in your life if you allocate more time to physical activities, regardless of the purpose and nature of the activity. In this regard, one may accentuate the relations between physical and mental health and well-being. It should be noted, however, we do not know a great deal about the exact interaction between body and mental health. Nevertheless, their importance and their mutual effects are undeniable. In conclusion, having a healthy life is rooted in our approach towards our life. One of the predominant examples is the effect of sport, physical activities and exercise on both mental robustness and medical condition. According to this fact and based on the presented justifications, which have been explained in the paragraphs above, the relevant authorities should take all necessary measures in order to mitigate the severe outcomes of a hectic but inactive lifestyle. In this regard, educational complexes, such as universities, could provide certain measures to adequately address this problem.

Hi Alex, How are things? Sorry to be so slow getting back to you, but I've been hitting the books. Moreover, I was afraid that you were mad at me. What great news! I'm so glad that you are great. In your letter you mentioned that you really wanted to invite me to you party, but unfortunately I can't attend it as I have to go to the doctor as I had my leg broken in an awful way. My apologies to you Alex. Besides, why don't we meet up another day and line up another outstanding party? Anyway, I will be delighted to get together another day, so let me know when we can hang out together. Well that's all for now, I hope that you can really forgive me for this sneaky affair.

I'm so very sad, my family and me are going to travel tomorrow. Then next Saturday I won't be here. We'll go to France and we'll stay there for two weeks. We want to visit some museums and ancient buildings and visit places of interest, such as churches and statues. I would like to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower, I think it'll be amazing. When I come back home I will meet you and go to the cinema. After that, we could have dinner in the new Italian restaurant near your home. What do you think about this? You can call me please and talk about that. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Take care. Maria

Hi Alex, I am so sorry, but I can't go to your party this Saturday. We are going to celebrate my grandma's birthday. We are going to meet the whole family this weekend. My grandma has a special day this Saturday. This age comes only once. I will see my whole family after a long time. We will see each other in school on Monday.

Hi Alex, Thanks very much for the party invitation! I am pretty sure there will be a great atmosphere and a lot of fun! Sadly, I will not be able to come, thus, please accept my apologies beforehand. I already booked accommodation for this Saturday night, in Brașov, as me and my work colleagues are participating in a 30 km Marathon over the small Jepi mountains. You know I am a big fan of such outdoor activities, I couldn't miss the chance to take part in such a challenging event. Since this weekend is fully booked, I cannot make up for my absence, but... how about Friday evening? Do you have anything planned for then? I heard they will be setting up a vintage clothes exhibition at the Friends shop, near to the main square. Why not go to have a look? Maybe we'll find something attractive among all those pieces. Afterwards, we can catch up while having a long walk across the city centre. Can't wait to hear how the party went and what presents you got. Let me know if my proposal suits you, or we shall arrange another time to see each other. Big kisses!

Hi Alex, Firstly, I want to apologise to you about not being able to come to your party. You know I would not miss your party if it wasn't for something important, but my granddad died. So I have to go to his funeral this Friday, and I will come back next Tuesday. I asked my parents if I could not go to my granddad's funeral, but they did not agree with me. They think that all family members should be together when someone in our family dies. Also they said your grandma will be happy when she sees you. So I can't come to your party, but I bought a present for you. And if you want we can meet at a restaurant to celebrate your birthday. I am okay for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We can meet between 10 am. and 7 pm. Email your answer. See you next week my best friend. Bye.

I partially support the idea that computers should replace books in schools and universities. At the present time, the use of information technology and computers is increasing rapidly. Scientists and inventors always make attempts to learn more about technology due to its excitement and change of the world. In terms of laziness, nowadays, humans are being couch potatoes and don't want to go outdoors. People neither have a drink nor read books in a library. However, they decide to put their feet up, go on the Internet and read books online instead. As far as I know, it's an advantage not having to pay any charges when we read books on the internet at home. That's extremely comfortable and convenient for people who aren't diligent! In addition to this problem, it's tremendously bad for humans' health and harmful to their eyes to spend lots of time only looking at a computer screen. Finally, try to read books online only if you're extremely busy with work. You should spend more time in a library to relax your mind and change the scenery for reading books.

I tried many times to argue with him; however, my boss did not fall for my arguments. I am really sorry for not going to your party, but I will be back from the trip next Wednesday, so we can meet next week in the case you have some free time.

To tell the truth, I want to cancel our appointment and I will go to my village to visit my mother. I write this email to apologize to you because of this cancellation. It would be a pleasure if you send me feedback for two reasons. The first is that you understand my worries about receiving this email . I mean hope you are not anxious about me. Because I am a strong man . These challenges that happen to humans are part of experiments that God wants to do to show the power of them.

Hi Alex! How are you? I'm sending you a message to prevent you I will not be able to go to your party this Saturday afternoon. I'm sorry. I apologize. Please, don't be mad at me, and let me explain why: Firstly, I have some important school work to do for Monday, and it will take me the whole weekend to finish it, trust me! Secondly, my mother is sick these days. She can't take care of my siblings correctly, so it's why I prefer to stay home and help them (and it will not be an easy task !). I know we've all been expecting this party for weeks, and I pray you forgive me for this unexpected cancellation from me. But, you know, I always have a solution: In two weeks, it will be the summer holiday. Do you want us to organize a big party to celebrate the end of the year? We can plan to do it after our last classes. Are you free on Friday, the 22nd of June? What do you think about it? Will you forgive me for this Saturday? Have a good week. Your dear friend, Sammie

My family and me are flying to Turkey, we haven't been on holiday for nearly 3 years, so they wanted me to go with them, too. I will see my family there, they are from Russia and I haven't seen them for almost 5 years. Would you like to meet after my vacation? We could go to the cinema and watch the new movie. I will be there just for seven days. We could go to the cinema together. I hope that you'll enjoy your birthday party with all the guests.

Dear Alex, Thank you for your invitation to your party this Saturday. But I apologise to you that I can't go to the party. In fact, I will move house on that day. I didn't tell you or all my friends I had planned to move from the house I'm living in now to a house that is next to five houses. I didn't say it because it's too close moving. We will start to move from 9:00 AM on the day and plan to finish at around 6 PM. It's a short move, but there is lots of furniture, so it would take a long time. Besides, we haven't asked a moving company to do the move for us this time. So we have to finish moving house with the power of our family only. You know, my family has many women. My mother, my big sister, and two small sisters. On the other hand, my father and me are the only men. So, my father and I will carry the heavy furniture, like beds, desks, the fridge, and so on during the day. If you are OK with it, can I go to your home next Sunday? I will bring you a present to make it up to you this time.

The reason is that my father is going to set up his new tool shop the same day as your birthday, and he asked me to help him with the preparations. I couldn't say no because it was before your invitation. My dad told me that we are going to spend the whole day in the shop, so I'm going to arrive in town at night. Would you like to meet next Saturday? I've heard about a new French restaurant, a friend of mine just told me that they have a chef that is well-known in Europe.

Hi Alex Thank you for inviting me to the party. I'm afraid I can't go. This Saturday is my brother's birthday, and I have a lot of things to do, such as decorating, shopping, and other things like that. Also, I'm cooking special dinners for him. It will take around 3 hours, so I can't attend the party. However, I really want to participate in your party. Therefore, can you change the schedule? How about next Monday? We will have finished the regular examination at that time, and I don't have any plans for that day, so I think it's a perfect day. If you can't make it, how about next Tuesday? That day is a school holiday, so we can spend a lot of time preparing and enjoying ourselves. Anyway, I know that it's hard to change the date, but as I said, I really want to go to your party.

My experience using Write and Improve for the last month. During this time I have been using this site for almost 2 or 3 hours a day. At this point I have an idea about it all and I can give a review about what you could expect once you enter. My suggestions are that when you are writing, whatever it is you can not indentify what you have wrong, that is something I would like to change in the system. I also have to say the system is very good for those who are not native English speakers and want to spend their time improving their grammar skills and discovering new ways of writing and vocabulary. In my recommendation, I would like to encourage you to complete all the tasks you can do, there are many exercises about many topics.

Hi Alex, I'm afraid I can't join you at your party. Lamentably, I tripped while I was running to catch the bus, and at the moment my leg is injured. I have to go to hospital, and I think that I will need a week before I can put a foot out of bed. I'm so sorry! On Saturday I will call you to hear the news and the rumours about your last job from you. I have heard that you are very excited to start the job next week. I'm sure that your party will be amazing and great, but don't forget the cake which is at the bakery! When this stint in hospital ends, I promise we'll catch up, I'm so sorry to let you down. Do you agree with meeting at the fountain in front of the museum next month? Do you mind if I ask you to be patient? Yours, Fran

Dear Alex, How are you? I appreciate your invitation for your Saturday afternoon party, but unfortunately I will not be able to go. This Saturday is my mother´s birthday, and we are going to have lunch outside in some different place. Because of that, we will arrive home later and probably very tired too. You know my mother, she is a very difficult person to give a present to, so we decided that we should go to a special place instead. I hope she will like it. I am sorry about that, I really would like to go and meet all our friends again, it has been a long time since we met for the last time. How about we schedule another party for next month? I was thinking about going camping in the countryside, I believe everybody would appreciate a good camping trip with good meat and some beers, of course. Anyways, it was good to hear from you, and hope to see you soon. Regards, João

In my view, requiring volunteering as mandatory work that students have to complete to graduate is a great idea and must be carried out in high schools. I will give three reasons to prove my opinion. First, volunteer work suits students. Almost all students have a lot of free time, and volunteering can make this free time into meaningful time so they can dedicate their time and work for the community. The next reason is students can gain plenty of soft skills while working as a volunteer because volunteer work requires the volunteer to work with people to do something for other people, students can gain plenty of soft skills during doing as a volunteer. Because volunteer work requires the volunteer to work with people to make something for other people, student can prove some skills in teamwork, communication, time - management, planning, event organizing, and so on. And the last one is doing volunteering helps students be aware of life more clearly. During volunteer work, meeting miserable people makes them feel sympathetic with the unlucky, so they will regard what they have and want to give more to society. In conclusion, it is good for students if their high school turns volunteering into compulsory work for graduation because it benefits both the community and the student.

I like to practice yoga, ride a bike and swim in the pool. I practice yoga at home and ride my bike in the forest in my city. I don't go to the gym and do fitness. My kids exercise at school and we ride bikes together and swim in the lake. Sometimes we run on a pitch after a ball and ski in the winter. I'm just learning to ski, but I'm making progress in my studies. I would like to fly a balloon and a glider but I can't yet. Maybe one day I'll learn. Everything is ahead of me, I will still learn and make my dreams come true. See you sometime.

Good morning Alex, I appreciate your invitation to the party this Saturday afternoon. It has been a long time since we met last time, although we have kept in touch, but I am really disappointed that I won't be able to meet you this time. Unfortunately, I can't be present at your party because my professor has asked me to do some research with him, so I must stay at school this weekend. I want to apologize to you for not being able to be present at your party this time. There are five days of holiday next month, do you want to come to my country to spend some time with me? I would take you to our traditional restaurants and we could see the new movie that is about to come out next week, the name of which is " Speedman." I have already seen the trailer and I think you would like it. So what do you think about this suggestion? I hope we can meet again as soon as possible. All the best wishes to you. Your friend May

Hello Billal, the school trip was amazing, let me tell you something about it. We went to the Conservation Park, it's a former zoo, we did a lot of things, first we walked following the trail, watching the animals. We started with the hippos, then we saw the rhinoceros, the ostriches and the lions. But the most popular animal was a white cat, the employees didn't know what kind of feline it was but we think it is an albino ocelot.

Hi, Last week I went on a short trip with some friends at school. On Thursday, we drove to Polsefid early in the morning and had breakfast there. It was a nice sunny day. Then we drove to Sangedeh and got there at noon. We made a barbeque at my friend's place in the village, and stayed there for the night. On Friday we went deep into the forest again and had fun until 4 o'clock in the evening. I enjoyed the whole trip! Homeyra

I'm so sorry that l cannot go to your party. My grandmother is sick and my mom needs to go and take care of her, so l will go with my mom to grandma's house for a week. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine there. The doctor said my grandmother just needs a few weeks to let her body get over the virus. It's a common sickness, but also dangerous for elderly people. Sorry to let you down. I'll cheer for you on the other side. But, there are still some solutions. I'm going to leave on August 10th, so if you want, maybe you can change the date to the day before it. Then, l guarantee that l definitely will show up at your party. Best regards

The number of people who always use computers and tablets is increasing day by day. Because of that, technological tools are always in our lives. We can manage our work with these tools easily. While many people prefer to use computers and tablets, other people choose to use books in their school life. In my opinion, using technological tools sometimes can be efficient, but we should use books instead of computers and tablets. Computers and tablets can be a distraction in our school lives. So many people use these tools to take notes and study. I believe that this can affect our concentration. Our focus time is decreasing. In conclusion, a lot of people prefer to use technological tools, but they do not know that they will lose their concentration. We should not replace computers and tablets with books.

Hi Matt, My focus is on my writing and listening skills. And I've already begun! I started an online program a few weeks ago, Write & Improve, to improve my writing. It is a very useful program. Check it out and tell me what you think. I've also started watching short Youtube videos every week day to improve my listening. First, I watch the video once or twice. Then I watch it once with the subtitles on to understand what I couldn't at first. In the end I watch it once again without the subtitles. What do you think about this method? Best wishes, Homeyra

Hi Alex!! I'm glad to hear from you. There was no news from you for a long time. Thank you very much for your party invitation, I would like to go very much, but it's impossible. I broke my leg skiing last week, and I have to rest for two months. I cannot walk. I broke my leg in three places and spent one week in hospital. I know your parties are really fun, and usually a lot of old friends go there. It would be a good option to meet them. It's a pity. When you organize another party, please don't forget me. I promise you I won't miss it. In spite of not being able to see each other at your party, I would like to meet you soon. When I finish my resting time, I think I will be able to drive again, and we can meet in your city. Or if you don't mind driving, you could come here and we stay at home. I look forward to your answer. Best regards

Because I am currently unemployed, I have a lot of free time. Besides daydreaming, which I do most often, what I've recently been doing with my free time is reading about social sciences and self-help books. I might read up to three times a day and each time up to half an hour. I like reading because there is a lot I want to know about and learn. Moreover, it's the only way I know to help myself with my shitty life, though it hasn't been very helpful so far. Last night, I started a new book on economics.

My favorite indoor activity is cooking. I like to cook because I see it as a form of art that calls for my creativity: It makes me feel creative, given that I'm not in a hurry. This evening I cooked a simple but delicious dinner, mirzaghassemi, and in a different way than usual. I learned that I don't have to roast or fry the eggplants. I can simply chop them into very small pieces and let them cook along with the tomatoes.

My favorite season of the year Hello everyone, Do you know the essay that a famous author wrote? It is “Makura-no-Soushi”. I love the essay because it described the four seasons in Japan. The author admired the four seasons, and said “Shiki” in Japanese. In my mother town, there are many kinds of festival associated with “Shiki”. I have been affected by them. My emotion was grown by loving u201CShikiU+201D. By the way, what's your favorite season? My favorite is autumn. Do you know why? I love the whisper of “Suzumushi”. And the full moon in autumn is the most beautiful one in the year. If you have never seen that, you should get an airplane ticket to Japan. It will be an experience that you can never forget. I am sure of it. Please tell me your memory about seasons. I am looking forward to happening to meet your letter!

Music is something exclusively recreational, but totally necessary for our lives. I couldn't live without music because I really love music. I love going to a concert, I love discovering a good new artist and read about him and his career. Unfortunately, I couldn't play the guitar because I am not talented, but I don't care, I love music in the same way. I like to follow local artists and I think that in my country we have excellent music, but it is not appreciated by local people. I love music because it can make us feel better or worse about our feelings. Life without music would be sadder, all people would be sad every moment without the possibility to get better because we wouldn't have music. But also I think this would be impossible because music is the same as being human. It is like a natural ability of humanity.

Due to the advancement of electronic books, the question of whether computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities is discussed widely. Fortunately, renowned experts have a precise answer for this query. In their view, this suggestion shouldn't be carried out due to the fact that e-books are quite vulnerable to power outages and corruption. To illustrate, all digital textbooks could be hacked in a matter of seconds, disabling education hazardously for a couple of weeks. Therefore, this kind of data should be always backed up, no matter how bulky the backups are. However, it doesn't mean that we must discard e-books entirely. After all, they have numerous advantages: first and foremost, they don't use up much space. Furthermore, they efficiently fight deforestation. And last but not least, they are easier to carry around. In conclusion, I would argue that computers and tablets should be combined with traditional books instead of replacing them completely in schools and universities.

The more the gap between the rich and the poor grows, the more alluring wealth becomes. This state of affairs reminds us of the old saying: it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. With the aim of solving this dilemma, the relationship between health and money will be covered in the essay. Obviously, money can't cure all diseases. To illustrate, in spite of being heavily funded, oncologists haven't found an effective treatment for cancer yet. Furthermore, there is a plethora of fatal rare diseases waiting to be cured. And as expected, they don't care about the patients' bank accounts. On the other hand, it can't be denied that money possesses a profound effect on our health. That is to say, maintaining health requires costly needs, such as a clean and secure shelter, hygiene and healthcare infrastructure, balanced diet, etc. Besides, some research suggests that wealthier patients usually receive more efficient treatments. In conclusion, I would argue that wealth is superior to health due to the fact that it maintains health, though it isn't always the case.

There are basically two seasons in the year where I live. From September to March, we have a very hot, damp summer. From April to August, we have a cold, dry winter. That means we have hot weather most of the time. That pleases me a lot! It is almost impossible to like this winter. Therefore, my favourite season of the year is summer. Especially at the beginning, it is warm but not so much. I like this part. During this part of summer, it is perfect to go out any time of the day. You can really enjoy your life whatever the time. It is up to you. I also like the fact we can wear fewer clothes, which makes our bodies freer. At the peak of summer, it is really hot and not so enjoyable. We sweat a lot more in that hot weather. We have to be careful to not get stinky. Also, you need to stay in the shadows, in order to not get burned.

Dear town council, I am currently writing to you concerning your thoughts about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in other facilities. As far as I am concerned, removing the right to use phones during a trip or from a direction to another is a bit tough. As a matter of fact, everyone feels the need to go checking their notifications on social media, looking at the daily news on the Internet or even sending messages to a relative. Phones are now common in our society, banning the use of them would be seen as a constraint. However, you could reconsider other possibilities to, at least, decrease the issue of always using phones in public places. On the one hand, I truly agree with you with the idea of reducing the use of phones but not completely. For example, I advise you to set up an accurate schedule in order to show animation in shops or restaurants to catch people's eyes so they may not be on their phones again. On the other hand, you cannot oblige people not to use their phones. So, let them use it when they need them. To sum up, reducing the use of phones, and not banning them is the best option, according to me. It would finally get people free from their phone's screen and make them realise in what a wonderful and gorgeous society they are living in. I would be delighted if you take my opinion into consideration. If you need a further thought on your request, send me a letter. All the best,

Hi student. I am from Poland and I am writing to you to tell you what I like to eat. When I was a child, I liked sweet cakes and chocolate. Today, I don't like sweets and I prefer meat with vegetables. In Poland we eat more soups for dinner. For breakfast, I like bread with tomato, cucumber and cheese. I have been eating Japanese food for the last month and I like it. I drink tea with lemon, but without sugar. I like coffee with milk and without sugar. I am curious to know what you like to eat in your country, write an email to me. Bye, your friend, Krzysztof

Hi dear Alex, You asked me to tell you about my favourite movie. Honestly, it's hard because I have many favorite movies, but today I'll tell you about one of them that I watched about 12 times. It is Pride and Prejudice, I love it. It's from the Regency era and written by my favorite writer Jane Austen. I love her work. You know it's all about the 18th century and as you know I love the 18th century. Some people say, "Oh, she is too positive about love, and blah blah blah," but personally I love her work. If you want to see it , see the 2005 version. Hope you'll like it. Love, Mahsa

I have been doing miniature art in my free time. I often do it once a week, especially at the weekend or on public holidays. I enjoy that activity because it makes me relax and helps me to focus more while I study. This art can change our mind and we can feel a combination of colours because it involves a sense of feeling about art. On Peka Paka Day, that is a public holiday in my country, I did it last time. I invited my friends to do that art together with me that day.

This film is a type of science fiction film and you will see beautiful places, natural views, secret spaces and great acting from the actors and actresses. The general purpose of this movie is to show that we should change from Earth to Jupiter because our motherland will be destroyed in a few centuries.

Good morning Alex! How are you? I hope everything is fine with you and your family. I 'd like to say thank you very much for inviting me to the party next Saturday. But, unfortunately, I can't go. Because of this, I'd like to say sorry for disappointing you. On the Saturday that you booked for this event, I could see, after checking my diary, that I had another activity planned before you contacted me. This other meeting is related to my project of immigrating to Canada which I have to explain to my family. Probably, it will be necessary to spend the whole afternoon discussing what will be the difficulty of this process with them. Then, I'd like to suggest to you that we will meet next week. Maybe we can hang out the next Friday, where we go together to the cinema and after that to a snack bar to talk about life. I think that will be very nice for both. One more time, I'd like to say sorry and I wish you a good party next Saturday. I wait for your reply about the new plan to go out. Kind regards,

Hi Alex, I have just received your email and I am so flattered that you have invited me over to your party. I wish I could make it, but I am swamped this week. First of all, I've gotta complete two school projects by Sunday. Additionally, I have midterms coming up in 1 week. Last but not least, I have an appointment with a dentist due to some health issues. This will cost me my whole week. Therefore, I won't be able to come to your party. On the other hand, my midterms and project will have been done by Monday. So, I am quite free next week. To make it up, I am inviting you over to my house upcoming Wednesday. I will cook delicious home-made pasta and I will pop open some champagne for you. I would be delighted if you accepted my offer. I am sending my sincere apologies again. Lots of love.

Dear Alex, Perhaps you will be surprised when you receive this email from me. I don't wanna send this rejection to you, but I think I have to do that. With reference to your party invitation for me, I write this email to apologize to you. Thanks for having me, I really wanna go there and burn over night with you. I had even chosen a nice dress for myself for this party and some gifts for you. However, something has happened. You know I have just moved to a new school, right? I have a few problems here and I cannot solve them immediately. There are many practical projects for students, they want their students to have more real experiences than theory. And it really is my big problem, I don't have any friends and I cannot do the projects alone. This Saturday afternoon, I have a plan to go to the museum with my class. I can cancel it and participate in your party, but I think this is the best chance for me to make new friends and invite them to do a project with me. Are you sad because of me? I am so sorry about that, I know this party is important to you. I don't have any ways to face this. Perhaps this is the best way to solve it, so don't be mad at me, please. OK Alex, although I am not present at your party, I prepared a special gift for you. Actually, it is fragile so I cannot send it to you by shipping service. Do you mind spending your day off after this party with me? I wanna have a meeting with you to give you this gift. I am sure that you will love it. I am afraid that you will be very tired when the party ends, so anytime you feel great you can call me. I swear, I will give you all my time. One more time, sorry babe and have fun! Just enjoy your party and don't forget to send me some pictures of that day. See you soon, Alex. Hanee

I agree with the sentence that health is more important than being rich. In my opinion when we are healthy, we can try to obtain wealth. But oppositely, if we don't have health we probably can't gain wealth. We sometimes might exchange our health for money or spend money on health. When we are healthy, we can work and try better. I think health is a kind of wealth and we must be grateful for having it in every moment. In the moments you have a pain and an injury, nothing makes you happy and you are ready to give all of your wealth to achieve your health. So health also has effects on our spirit. Health is one of our blessings and when we lose it we understand its worth more than before . Maybe you'll say to me that we gain health with money and wealth, but I say if you lose, for example a leg, or hand, or tooth you can never gain same.

Learning English English is the most popular language on Earth. And people can't live without English unless they have a translator or don't learn other things. Many people learn English just because English is used all over the world, and it will seem that they're good at studying. But they don't have too many things to do with English. I learn English just because I want to go to one of America's best universities to learn. Just like Harford or Oxford. I have to speak English very well if I want to go there to learn. In the United Kindom they also speak English, only that their pronunciation is slightly British. But it's the same language, English! Another reason I am learning English is that I love traveling to all places. A large number of people can speak English, and if I learn English, I can communicate with them. These are the reasons that I am learning English. Thanks for reading!

Sleeping is important in our lives, so we need to sleep very well for at least six hours per day. Some people are comfortable in a dark and quiet room and some people prefer pale light and noise is not a problem for them. In my opinion, it is not important because each person has their preferred sleeping style. The most important point is we should sleep enough per day. I can't sleep very well in bright spaces but pale light or dark spaces do not affect me. I don't like noises because if someone is making a noise, I can't sleep very well . So, if I need to choose between them, I will choose a small light and a quiet space, because I can't sleep in the daylight.

I will explain to you, a computer connected to the internet is very powerful and I can find vocabulary or books very quickly and easily, so that is the reason I always use it. I don't like small computers, especially laptops. My favourite computer is a desktop which has a big screen and other more fashionable features.

I think that it depends on the quality of the teacher and the topic that we are learning. For example, if the teacher is good then maybe it will be better if we have only one for many years, but if he is a bad teacher it will be worse if we change this teacher quickly. Another important thing is the topic. I think that our English benefits if we study that with many teachers because with that we can learn different vocabulary and accents. We have to listen to and understand many accents and with that we will learn the ability to understand anyone. But to answer the questions about having different teachers, I prefer to have different teachers. We can take the best of each one and with that we learn very much. Another fact to take into account is that with several teachers we also develop our social skills and this always is a great plus.

My opinion is based on my own experience and I have to say that I love video games. I keep playing video games nowadays and I enjoy and learn a lot with video games. You can learn about several topics, like history, empathy, logical thought, and so on. So I think that video games can do good things to our children, improving their intelligence and also their knowledge about the whole world. An important topic that is improved with video games is English. It is proven that in countries where English is not the main language this hobby helps children to have a good vocabulary in the future because most of the games are not dubbed into other languages. So the kids have to play the game in English and with that they are learning new words while they are having fun and passing the time. This is an amazing hobby.

I think that if the zoo has quality then it is better for the animals because people in a zoo always take care of animals with great devices and gadgets. I even think that some animals are alive because of that, for example pandas. Pandas are animals that are in danger, but one of the reasons for that is that they can't process their own food by themselves. They have to wait for a person that processes the food for them. And I am sure that there must exist more animals in the same situation, namely, animals who are depending on people to live correctly. We don't have to go to an extreme situation with the animals, even the animals who don't need humans to survive receive great treatment and they are very happy in the facilities in the zoo. Of course, I am talking about great zoos with great investment.

Also, it has a great sea with a beautiful beach. In second place, I enjoyed Amsterdam because it was the most different city compared to my city Bogotá.

I think that there are only advantages. Maybe it has only one disadvantage, which is that it could be a little expensive, but the advantages are absolutely huge. If you have the possibility to study abroad then I recommend you to take this option because travelling abroad is one of the most enriching activities that you can do. You will live amazing experiences with many people. You will understand other cultures and you will grow as a human being. Also, if you don't have English as your native language you could learn a lot of English by travelling. I am sure that in a year we can learn a lot of English living in a city where everyone speaks in English. And as the last thing, but not less important, studying abroad will give you a lot of experiences that you will remember years later, as you will realize that you have had a good life.

I think that everything counts when we are talking about our health. I mean, there are a lot of factors that could intervene in our health. First, there is exercise or physical activity. I think that it is not necessary to do exercise every day and more than one hour, or something like that. We can just do a little physical activity and with other factors we could live healthily. Another important factor is food. We must eat healthily most of the time. Obviously, we can eat junk food, but not every day. Another thing that I think is very important is the mind. You have to maintain your mind healthy. How you can maintain your mind healthy depends because the activities change for each one of us. If meditation works for you then do it, or maybe you like to learn new things then do it, or something that works for everyone is travelling.

Rather than calling you and bothering you, I've decided to write to you. I also know how important this party is to you. It's one of the biggest events you've ever organized in your career. You are an exceptional professional in this area, and I have no doubt that you will nail it! The main director of my company has decided to change the whole sector. It is what he calls "a reshape." For this reason, he has demanded additional tasks and adjustments to our protocols. As you can imagine, I'm completely stressed out.

Travelling is a curious topic because I think that we as a society are getting stuck with it. In other topics, like the internet, computers, mobiles, vehicles, medicine, and so on, humanity are developing new advances every day, but travelling remains with the same fastest way of travelling which is the airplane. What I am trying to say is that we can't improve the speed with which we can travel to other parts of the world. For the last 3 decades we haven't been able to go faster and we need the same hours to go from America to Europe, for example. All advances are with small distances. Land vehicles are advancing every day, they are changing and maybe in the future all of them will have an electric supply. To sum up, I think that to travel long distances in the future we will use the same periods of time, but we will improve travelling for short distances more and more each day.

This is a really hard question to get a correct answer for because school is changing every day and more so with the last pandemic when school had to implement online courses or something different because students and people couldn't go out. So now schools have new ways to teach and more resources. Maybe in the future schools could be hybrid, a classroom half and an online half. Or also it could be only classroom lessons and online lessons as a plus for students who want to keep learning and studying. But to answer, I think that schools will remain practically the same. We have a way to teach. We as a society have used it for many years and now this is very difficult to change. The easiest way to teach is to keep teaching in the same way.

I don't think that any devices are bad or useless, the problem is how we use them. Television could be educative, but it depends on the way we use it. There are many educational shows like documentaries. Also, television could be a great tool to learn some language. For example, I use it to learn English. I watch an episode per day totally in English to practise my listening and vocabulary and also I enjoy the episode that I am watching. It is the most important example that I can give you to show how television can be an educational device. It's like video games. They could also be an educational way to learn something. Or even music. All depends on how you use the thing and what you want to learn with that device or activity. I enjoy my routine of practising English with a TV show a lot.

Hi Cristina! I have heard about your accident last week. I'm sorry for you because I know you are having a special professional moment. What has your doctor said about the complications of your accident? Is it serious? Are there possibilities to have consequences? If I can do anything to help, please tell me, don't be afraid to ask for my help, I'm so sorry about your situation and I want to do something to make this less worse. I'm thinking of visiting you on Friday because I'm travelling this week and I'll arrive just at the end of the week. Best regards.

Our goal in life is to be happy. Happiness is the greatest life goal and to reach it we have to do many things. Maybe to reach happiness we must earn money and buy things, or maybe it could be reached practicing sports or reading many books. The method to reach happiness could be very different for each one of us, but one thing is traversal without taking into account who we are. We have to be healthy. If we don't have health then we can't reach or do any of the activities that I mentioned before or any other activity. If you can't stand up or walk you won't be able to travel around the world or play any sport. Then because of that you must take care of yourself and be sure that you are doing things in a good way to remain in good health. Good health can be reached with eating well and exercise.

It's commonly said that you are learning English because you want to travel around the world or because you want to get a better job, but for me the main reason to learn English is because I want to be able of read, listen, or watch a lot of information in its original language. English is the language of the world, then if you want to learn about one topic or read an interesting book you maybe have to read it in English. A lot of interesting books or funny series are in English or have more quality if you see them in English. Obviously, I take other reasons into account, like if you want to travel around the world you have to learn English because with that you will be able to talk with others and get whatever you want to buy or solve any doubt.

All the sales department staff had a discussion yesterday about what style of new room will be replaced in yesterday. Two styles of business room are traditional rooms with enclosed workstations or cubicles and modern rooms with open design, which will be decided by staff. In my opinion, I think modern rooms with an open design are better than others. First, most companies rent offices to work in at present. The open design saves workspace by eliminating thick walls between rooms. Rooms are separated by glass walls, mezzanine partitions or panels. We do not need much money for renting. Besides, the open design means that one room is for all the staff, we do not need to buy a lot of equipment for each staff member, all the equipment is shared by all staff. Secondly, the open design creates a dynamic working environment. Employees can see each other so they can easily communicate together, which make them feel like a team. Finally, the open design enhances work efficiency. Managers can easily check what staff are working on. In addition, employees will limit personal work during working time. So staff will work more effectively.

First of all, I decided to go to a concert to have a great time with my girlfriend and I thought of the concert as a gift to her and to me. The selected artist was Cepeda, a Colombian singer who sings romantic music. The concert was amazing because Cepeda sings really well. It is like if you were listening to it on CD. The concert lasted close to two hours with his whole song repertory. I left the concert feeling very happy with the experience. I am convinced that next year my girlfriend and me are going to go to another concert of Cepeda.

There are four seasons in a year, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. There are many flowers in spring, it's very colourful and fresh in this season. The weather is very hot and sunny in summer, and we need to hide from the strong sun. The temperature is not very high, and it's not very cold in autumn. Winter is very wet and cool, and many children like to play in the snow with their friends, so they will be luck and happy. My favourite season is summer. I like to go swimming during this period, and I can train my body in the swimming pool or the sea. I may go windsurfing beside the beach, although it's dangerous sometimes. If I can have an excellent and successful performance, I'll win the competition that I should become the winner of this event. I'll continue to participate in this match and I'll try my best to finish it, and I'll achieve my goal finally. I'll have a wonderful and amazing result in the future, and I believe that I should defeat a lot of difficulties and overcome some problems. I practise this sport with my best friends, and we'll improve our abilities or have a healthy body by ourselves. We should be confident and we must have some confidence in our heart. We enjoy the air conditioner, and we feel comfortable and enjoyable with this modern technology.

Learning to speak a foreign language is more important these days than it was in the past. This is because nowadays we can communicate with any person around the world with our cellphones or computer. Then we can work, play, write, and do other things with other people and to do that we need to speak with them. In the past, we didn't have this possibility so we just had to speak our native language. And of all foreign languages the most important is English. You must know English nowadays if you want to have a great job or travel around the world to any country because with English you will be able to talk with any person. If other countries don't have English as their native language, then some people will learn English and you will be able to communicate with them.

I don't believe that computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Books are a beautiful way to touch knowledge. With a book you can feel the knowledge as an object while on a computer you only see letters on a screen. With a book you are the owner of a part of knowledge. Another thing is that with a book you will take care of your eyes while on a computer or tablet the screen will hurt your eyes over time. Also, I like reading in a book more than on a screen. I read on screens because I don't have some book or because I don't find the information in a book, but in general I prefer reading in a book on real paper. I don't have any more to say about the topic. I prefer books, but I know that computers are more needed than books.

I had a discussion with my parents yesterday about whether students should live with family while they are studying at university or they should move away and live alone. In my opinion, I think students should live with their family until they graduate from university. Firstly, students who are studying at university, aged from 18 to 22, are still young and do not have enough life experience, do not understand well about social life and they are easily gullible to strangers. A lot of people are tricked about money by scammers or their friends when they are students at present. Secondly, students live with their family when they study at university which is a way to decrease the burden of money for their family. Students must pay a lot of money for four years studying at university. Besides, if students want to move away and live alone, they must pay money for the cost of living every month. However, most students depend on family finances , so most of the money is paid by their family. It is a great burden for each family. They do not have knowledge about the value of money in life and how hard it is to have it. Finally, if students want to have financial independence when they move away and live alone, they must find a part-time job to have money, they must spend most of their time on it, so they don't have enough time for studying and volunteer work. Part-time work will affect their academic performance at university.

Dear Alex, I want to apologize that I will not go to the party which you invited me to. Though I want to join this party, unfortunately, I have to go to Konya this Friday and deal with several jobs to support my family. I am going to spend this weekend there. What do you say about meeting another day such as next Saturday? I have a perfect idea! If you are available, we can hang out at the Yedigöller camping area, which was chosen as the best place among all camping areas last year. People who went there had a good time last year and enjoyed their camping experience. That is why I consider that it might be nice to assess our weekend. Although I have a car to go there, we should rent an off-road car. I have some camping stuff, like a tent, a thermos, and a camping bag. However, we have to buy some materials that we don't have. I will write to make a plan about camping in more detail soon. Do not forget to send photos from the party. I hope you enjoy the party, have a nice day and take care. Your friend, Hüseyin

Write and Improve is an excellent resource to practise English writing because you don't need a teacher to start to write. The tasks that the web page has are interesting and you can choose the level that you want. The level changes the length and difficulty of the topic of the task. Another interesting feature of Write and Improve is the implementation of Artificial Intelligent to correct the texts and with that everyone can improve and get a better writing level. I strongly recommend the web page because many times people don't have someone to practise their English with and this page could be the solution to this problem because you can start to study immediately and you receive instant feedback just like you would from a teacher. I am going to continue using this resource to improve my writing and with that I can also improve my speaking a little.

To the council office, I have recently heard that you have an idea to ban mobile phones on public transport, in shops and in restaurants. I hope that this news may be wrong, and you, whom I have recognized as the wisest council that we have ever had, do not have any crazy view about banning mobile phones on public transport, in shops and in restaurants. For me, you are the best policy maker who never wants to involve yourself in batty things, and you are a man who always wants to make a wonderful change to society, and build a delighted community. If that is the right news, I suggest that, please, do not take this plan because the mobile phone is a handy and hefty today instrument today. We cannot even imagine any person without this handy tool. I admit that this useful tool causes many problems throughout society. For example, it makes a noisy environment, and may be the cause of many traffic accidents. As a solution, we must not prevent the use of phone in public places, but we must limit the use of this fragile tool for many individuals, for example, bus and taxi drivers and waiters. It seems very crazy why you want to ban the use of mobile phone in shops. I do not know exactly what the reason is, and for what purpose people do not have permission to use their mobile phones in shops. If there exists a hidden reason, please, reveal it as soon as possible. In my opinion, that decision must be cancelled.

Music is probably one of the best things that people once became interested in. I think that almost everybody around the globe really enjoys time spent listening to music. Listening to music has started being a common thing throughout people's lives. Whatever people are doing, if there is a chance to listen to music while doing it, they usually do it. People are listening to music while they are cooking, or working out, or just commuting to their destinations. The fantastic thing about music is that it somehow can change people's mood. Depending on what kind of music a person is listening to, it can make them feel happy, excited, energetic, and also sad. So even though people might be in a bad mood one day, music can change it completely. There are certainly times when music is very important. And those times are when people are depressed and need to be made happier. And in some ways music could do that. Another thing about music is that in the lyrics of songs there could be a lot of hidden meaning that you could recognize while listening to them and that could affect you as well. I think that our lives would be entirely different without music. It would probably be a lot more boring and not exciting to do things without music. People who make music would not be able to freely express themselves as they could do in music, and so they would likely be more reserved towards others. Also, they would not be able to make money from music. If there were no music at all, the bad thing about it would be that every moment of life that contained music would not be remembered as well as it might. Just listening to music could remind you of a lot of things from the past, whether it would be happy moments or sad moments. I personally extremely enjoy this feeling when you get to listen to music that was playing at that concrete time in your life. It is incredible. From my perspective, the world without music would be definitely not as good as it is now.

What is my favorite season? It is a hard question nowadays because all seasons are very similar to me. But when I was in school my favorite season was obviously Christmas because I received gifts and I went on vacation at the same time. But nowadays I work the whole year and I have to request my holidays, so I can't choose a season for the holidays. The other reason doesn't matter anymore either because as I am an adult now I don't receive gifts anymore. Maybe one or two, but not the number that I received in the past. So I don't have a good reason to choose a season with my current lifestyle. Maybe it could continue being Christmas because I enjoy this season. I enjoy the lights, movies, and more things in this season.

Dear Sir/Madam, I read your announcement about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants on the government website yesterday. I have some opinions I want to share with you. First, the mobile phone is a great invention of mankind, we use it to contact other people around the world, search for information on the internet, play games and it has a characteristic like a camera which helps taking and storing nice memories in pictures. The mobile phone is very popular, most people around the world have one of them at present. You want to ban it. That means you refuse the development of mankind from the past to the present. Second, mobile phones have become a part of people's life now. People use it to read the newspaper online when they come back home by public transport, they use it to take some photos with friends or just themselves when they come to a new store or new restaurant. People not using mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants means that they put a part of their life at home when they come here. I think they couldn't do that, instead they will leave here. It will do great damage to the economy of our city. Thirdly, people use mobile phones to contact each other like friends, members of their family and employees. If they couldn't use it in public, it will become a big problem for daily life. For example, when you are on your way home, your wife wants you to buy meat and vegetables at a convenience store, usually she will call you by mobile phone. However, if the government pass a law about banning the use of the mobile phone in public, she can only talk to you when you get home. So you waste a lot of time on buying food. I think banning mobile phones is impossible at the present.

Everybody lies and that's okay When we are children, our parents always say that lying is wrong. However, one common strategy to convince the kid that this is something wrong is saying phrases like, "if you lie your nose will grow longer" and it is obviously not true. Based on a cartoon of Pinochio, a story about a doll made of wood by a carpenter, this doll has life and he usually lies a lot, and whenever he does that his nose grows more and more. Adults always tell lies, for example, "Santa exists" and in reality it is just Santa's fantasy, worn by the daddy or another family member to give gifts at Christmas. We need to explain to the children that if they lie a lot the people won't believe them any more, besides, some lies could have several consequences and show some examples and risks, but it's important not to create an image of a lie as the worst thing in the world, sometimes there is not a problem with telling some white lies, to create magic, in examples of cartoons and fairy tale stories in general, to not hurt someone or teach that sometimes you can not answer with your point of view, and give a pattern answer, like "beauty is relative."

I had a discussion with my parents about whether people must always tell the truth or it is sometimes acceptable to tell a lie. In my opinion, I think it is sometimes acceptable to tell a lie. When you tell the truth to some one, they can be shamed or harmed so we use a white lie in these situations. A white lie is a term which is used to tell you some things that are not true but useless and harmless for anyone. In the medical area, when patients have an incurable disease, doctors, who take care of patients, often don't tell the truth about their medical condition. Instead, doctors will say their medical condition is very good and they are recovering to normal, they just tell the truth to the patients' family. If doctors tell the truth about their medical condition to patients, they could feel nervous and anxious about it. It has a bad effect on treatment or makes the sickness worst. In addition, the truth is sometimes unacceptable for someone, people usually want to hear something good about themselves instead of bad. For example, when a member of your staff, who works together with you in a company, asks you about how you feel about her new dress which she is wearing today. In your mind, you feel it is so ugly, terrible and unsuitable for her. However, if you tell the truth about your emotion about her dress to her, she could feel uncomfortable, shamed, or angry. It can break the bond between you and her in working and communication. Instead, you will say it is so beautiful and suitable for her. In the present, if you tell the truth, you would have an enemy. If you tell a lie, you have friends.

In recent times, a rumor has been spreading all over the world about replacing books with electronic devices, such as tablets and computers. Many agree, but others do not and the two "factions" express their opinion through pros and cons. One of the pros is that not cutting down the trees that are used to make paper would reduce the risk of deforestation. Another pro is that it would greatly reduce the weight of a backpack, which is a problem for students who live far from school. One of the cons, however, is that, in my opinion, those who cannot afford a tablet or computer will not be able to attend school lessons. Another con is that, in my opinion, electronic devices will never be able to replace paper books because even from the angle of touch it would be a bad change. In the end, if books are really replaced by tablets and computers, we will make a decision.

This is very important for the world of science. Of course, everything is very easy right now. We can translate as hear or copy. Learning a new language is always important. The fact that we can easily translate does not change the importance of language learning. It is a good way to spend time. And it may be a benefit.

On the deck of the boat, the view was beautiful. The St-Lawrence River extended as far as the eye could see. For me, this trip has been very instructive. I learnt a lot about the boats.

There are four seasons in a year. These are spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasons are just the opposite in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. For instance, if you are in the Northern Hemisphere, summers are hot, but the other Hemisphere is cold. The seasons affect the psychology of people. People feel sad and depressed in winter and fall. They drink their coffee under their blankets while looking out the window. During spring and summer, people become more active and fuller of life than in other seasons. I like being active, therefore my favorite season is spring. There are two reasons why I like it. The first reason is that the weather is neither cold nor hot. The mild weather does not make you sweat or shiver. The second reason is that nature renews itself in spring. For example, animals migrate from cold countries to warm areas, and trees and flowers bloom. All this change makes people energetic. Therefore I like spring.

I had a discussion with my parents about if all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week at present. In my opinion, I agree with that ideal. Firstly, strokes are tending to happen at a younger age. The main cause of a stroke is an inactive lifestyle. A new study in the journal Sport shows that anyone who doesn't get enough, or less than 150 minutes of, exercise a week has a higher than normal rate of having a stroke, so people should get at least 150 minutes of exercise every week. At present, the number of young adults who are students and have an inactive lifestyle has increased more than in the past. Almost all their time is just for using the smart phone, internet and socialising online. The rate of strokes in young adults increases every year. Secondly, doing exercise helps people have a nice body, good strength and a good mentality. Scientists, whose main research is on sport, have shown that people who take exercise daily live longer and are healthier than people who don't do it. If you want a long and healthy life, you must do exercise every day. In addition, exercise also helps people relax after a hard working day, increasing concentration and intelligence. Finally, students who do exercise at school have many opportunities to practise soft skills such as teamwork, communication and planning. Doing exercise at school has a lot of participants so students can talk and have fun together. They have opportunities to practise communication and teamwork. In addition, some sports have a win-lose nature, forcing participants to have a plan to determine victory or defeat, so students have opportunities to practise planning skills. The ideal that students must be physically active at least 3 times a week is a good decision.

Hi, I hope you're doing well! I wanted to let you know about a movie I've watched recently with friends. I really had fun watching it. That's why I think you should watch it too. It is called "Johnny English" and relates the story of a rather naive British spy. He wants to be as good as the best agents of MI6, but he achieves only the greatest mistakes. The story in itself is quite simple: a French guy tries to become King of England with a view to transforming it into a huge prison. But Johnny English and his partner will try to stop him, which leads to a chain of hilarious mistakes. I hope you'll have fun watching it! Have a nice weekend. John

Hi Alex, I hope you are doing well. First of all, I apologize for not going to your party this Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, I can't go because it's my daughter's party. She will be 8 years old, and also, my entirely family wants to be there. There will approximately be 25-40 people max. As you know, we have a big family. If you recall my mum had 6 siblings and 10 nephews and nieces. We will celebrate our birthday party in Sant Cugat, so it will also be difficult to combine my Olivia's party with your party, because one of my options was to go to your party for a while. However, I will not be able to do it, I am not a superhero. Anyhow, what do you think if we can find another day to meet each other and also to catch up about our personal and professional situation? I have a lot of news to explain to you and also, I would appreciate your advice because it will be useful and helpful. And again, thank you very much for your understanding. Best wishes, Roger

Hi Alex, How are you? I am writing to you because of your party. I really appreciate your invitation and I would like to participate, but I am afraid that I can't. I am going to be abroad because of my work. It is some kind of business trip that I have to take and it is very important so I can't cancel it. My boss would be so mad at me that there is no way I could say a thing about it, and to be honest I do understand him as it is a great chance for our company.

Hello Alex, I'd like to apologise to you because I won't go to your party this Saturday. I have been studying for my final exams this week, however, I'm very far from completing my tasks. I really would like to go, but on the other hand I need to pass with flying colors to get my certification. I was thinking about something that we can do on the next weekend. Do you like to listen to country? I got two tickets to Robert's concert and I'm very excited about going because I'm a huge fan. Then, we can go to the concert in the afternoon and after that we need to go to the new restaurant in the central park. You're going to love it I promise! At the same time, if you don't like country music we can do anything that you want! I miss you and want to spend some time with you soon!

Hi Alex, Hope this e-mail finds you well. I'm writing to apologise for my absence at the party on Saturday. I was ready to go, but my brother called me asking for help. He had a problem in his house, a water pipe broke and his house was full of water! Also, he has 3 children and they went crazy with the mess!!! So, I had to head towards his house fast. I spent the whole day taking care of the children while he was calling a company to solve the water pipe problem. The company arrived late at night and the problem was fixed. My brother lost some furniture due to that problem. The kids were very sad and I invited them to sleep in my house. Well, the situation was crazy, but it ended well in the end. I would love to meet you soon. Are you going to be available next week for lunch? Please, let me know when you are free! Best,

Nowadays, most people seem to be obsessed with their mobile phones, and it is crucially awful. And it would be outstanding to make people less immersed in their social lives. And I appreciate any town council's attempts to promote it, but the idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants altogether seems to me too bad a decision. And that type of measure needs to be rethought and replaced by a less strong and more pleasant one. And, there are a couple of reasons for that. The first one is that some people do need to use mobile phones due to important messages or calls, and they just couldn't wait until a receiver would go out and answer it. The second reason why people might need to use a mobile phone in those cases is that they might need to look something up on the internet or write a note. However, in a multitude of ways, people just use their phones to entertain themselves during the boring moments when they are at those places. And I think that the best that the council may do is to redesign the council's ban. The council should place a rule in those places that declares that people must just turn off the volume of their phones and use them in a way that doesn't interrupt others. And in addition to the rule, the council should create an environment in these places that will get visitors immersed and make them forget about phones. That would be a gorgeous action on the council's part for most people.

The reason for the problem that rural areas don't have enough doctors for their people is that a doctor can earn more money working in big cities. If you were a doctor and you had the possibility to work in a city or in a rural area and you would earn more money in the city then what choice would you make? I can be sure that most of the times people would choose to work in the city without thinking about the benefits that people can get if they work in a rural area. First of all, if you work in a rural area then you will have a more relaxing life than if you work in the city. Also it is true that you will earn more money in the city but also you will spend more money in the city. Then, in the end you will earn close to the same money in both places.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I think it is not possible. Books have been the most important source of information for centuries. In our days it is still like this. But the Internet replaces books in some areas. Books are still important sources of information, but the internet is more accessible and easier to use. If you want to access some information you don't have to go to the library, just sit and write on Google whatever you want. So computers and tablets can be useful, but I think they do not replace books. It can't be. Yes, the Internet is very useful, but also has a lot of wrong information. Sometimes you can't distinguish between wrong or right information. Also, reading books is culture. The opinion that books will be replaced by computers and tablets scares me. Everything is transformed into a technological thing. Sometimes the old is just something to need.

It's true that there are two different types of office that companies manage. One type is an office with cubicles where people only see their screens and no more and the other type is an office that don't have any cubicle and all people can see the others because there aren't so many walls. I think and I can be closely sure that the best option is an open office because with that people are happier and if people are happier then they will work efficiently. I can't believe that many companies nowadays keep managing their employees with enclosed offices. Those kinds of offices are really awful and maybe it was very popular in the past but now there are other times. Now people need open offices to work comfortably. If you casually are a boss with employees in one of these enclosed offices, please change that immediately and improve your company with an open office.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my country and specifically in my school this practice is implemented. I had to volunteer with the buses of my school helping the littlest children to carry their backpacks and open the doors to the buses. I think that it is a good practice because with that many people can get some help. Maybe if volunteer work in the schools didn't exist then these people wouldn't have this appreciated help. I know that this volunteer work could be helping children with their homework or simply helping to study some hard topic like maths or a language. I consider volunteer work as a good practice because with that we use the time of our teenagers and we teach them that helping is a good thing and maybe we must help people frequently.

I think that studying music in school is an enormous plus for a school that implements these classes. If I had a child I would prefer that his school had music classes. I think that it is a good thing because it could be a great practice to entertain the children with a good and healthy thing. And in the future they will thank us for having been taught to play an instrument. Playing an instrument could be a really difficult activity but if they start to study that from when they are children then they will learn to play a guitar, for example, more easily that an adult. It something similar to learning English or another language. If you learn this when you are a child it is better than learning it when you are already an adult. Another important thing is that I think that music is happiness and with that we are giving happiness to our children.

My Favourite Season Seasons allow us to experience different sides of a year. All of them have their own distinctive features. For instance, summer is known for its high temperature and holidays, winter is known for snow, and autumn is for leaves which are falling from the wonky trees. The four of them are extraordinary, occurring in a limited time - frame and they have left their place to the next as a seasonal cycle. However, spring has always been special in my heart since I was just a child. I presume that what keeps it apart from the others is that it is getting rid of the colorlessness and coldness of winter. It does not have the pale features that I hate. It is more colorful. Even though snowball fights are delightful, winter is just not enough for me. In spring, the sun appears more vividly, revealing all the beauty of nature. The cheerful chirping of the birds reminds me that life goes on in any case and a situation can never be bad after the insincere weather of winter. In conclusion, spring is the perfect time for me, felt better.

Books have been important since the invention of paper. Knowledge, feelings, and ideas have been transferred with books for ages. With computers and tablets becoming popular, recently the use of books has been decreasing. Computers have taken the place of books in many fields. In my opinion, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities due to ease of use, easier portability, and environmental reasons. First of all, tablets provide easy access to information. We can find any information we want with one click of a button. Students buy their textbooks on the internet, and they can read them on tablets. Most of my classmates use tablets instead of books. Another reason is that tablets are more portable than books. We can fit billions of books in a computer. A tablet weighs approximately 500 grams while an average book weighs about one kilogram. Considering that a student carries more than three books a day makes a huge difference. Lastly, millions of trees are being cut down to make books every year. On the other hand, tablets and computers never use trees. So they don't cause any damage to forests.

Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family while they are students. I think that the better choice is go to another place and live the complete experience of being a university student but if you don't have the opportunity to do that you don't have to regret that because you can have a great experience also living with your parents. And this choice has other benefits. If you live with your parents while you are studying at university then you will be able to focus on the exams and projects of the university because you won't have to think about household things like cleaning or cooking. You only will have to think about exams and no more. And if you choose to live in another place you will have total independence and this is one of the greatest things in the world.

This letter is addressed to the town council and it is regarding the new idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants. I really think that it is a really bad idea. I couldn't find a reasonable reason to think that this new idea could be a great idea. We can't simply not use our phones. People spend a lot of time in public transportation or waiting for something in a shop, we even have to wait for our food in a restaurant and we use our mobile phones to make the time better. We use our phones those times when we don't have anything to do because we have to wait for something. I think that it isn't a bad practice and we need to use our phones. Also another reason to not realize the idea is that maybe people could need their phones because of an emergency. We don't know when we could need our phone because our mom or any relatives had an accident or maybe if a relative needs some money right now then we could need the phone to communicate with them. There are a lot of situations when people could need their cellphones and the town council can't forbid the use of mobile cellphones. I think that it would be like a dictatorship or something similar.

I think that the world could be a great place if all of us were good people but it is impossible because bad people exist. Something similar occurs with lies. Maybe the world would be a better place if people don't tell lies or few lies. I think that in some cases we can tell some lies but this is only acceptable when the lies don't do any bad thing to the other person. I think that big lies are unacceptable. Big lies like infidelity, robbery or something that could do something bad to other person. I am sure that if people were more worried about the situation of other people we could have a better place to live in because we could be sure that no one wants to do something bad to us. We could go outside without the fear of being robbed or something worse, like a rape. We all know that people around the world could be very evil and we always have to prevent that and keep ourselves safe. It would be wonderful if we could walk without worries. This is the world that I dream of. I know that many times people do these things because they are in bad economic situations but I think that it is not an excuse to do bad things to others. All of us have our own problems.

I am from a group who likes to sleep in a dark and quiet room because if other people speak when I am not, I can't sleep again for one hour which is my reason for sleeping in a dark and quiet room.

In my opinion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room rather than sleeping with a small light on with some noise. I prefer that over the latter option for two main reasons: The first reason is that I have been to school for over five years. That matters a lot because my teacher does not allow us to make noise and she turns off all the lights and closes the curtains while we sleep. Also, the majority of time in the day is spent at school so our eyes will be more used to darkness. The second reason is when you sleep at night, virtually nothing makes noise then. Your body will soon adapt to those circumstances and then at some point, you would have to sleep in a dark and quiet room to sleep quickly. Mainly for the two reasons above, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room rather than sleeping with a small light on with some noise.

Hello everyone, I was asked to write an article about the question of what my favourite season of the year is. It is easy to say it is autumn, but it would not be an article if I only answered the question in one sentence. So I will describe in the following text why I like autumn so much. One reason for it would be the colorful trees. It is really special, in no other season do you have this, and I like it very much when the leaves turn from green to yellow or red. And the best of it is when you have the wind blowing and the colorful leaves falling like rain to the ground. It is difficult to describe how beautiful it is. Another reason why I like autumn so much is the weather. I would say it is the perfect mix between cold and warm. You have warm rainfall sometimes or you have low temperatures but a sun which warms you up. It is really perfect.

Some scientists argue that computers and tablets are beneficial to students at schools and at universities. Such devices combined are great tools to learn hard topics. However, I strongly disagree with these scientists and believe that tablets and computers cannot replace books at school or university. My belief is that electronic devices are not helpful for learning hard topics since their main objective is to advertise people. For example, I owned a tablet when I was younger and I never used it to learn anything related to any lectures I had. Before the invention of tablets and computers, students did not have any computers or tablets and they were as clever as we are. They did not have any access to Wikipedia or any websites to ease their learning. It's important to teach students how to find information by themselves. With tablets and computers, it easy for them to do some research on the internet and get an answer in under a microsecond.

People nowadays tend to be less active and consume more unhealthy food than they used to back in the days. And, as many researchers show, the less a person is active during the day, the worse their health becomes. And there is a huge problem with young people who are spending hours and hours a day sitting at home and playing video games which have a negative impact on their health. It is crucial to be active during the day and spend more time outside rather than inside because humans didn't use to spend that much time inactive. They used to have lots of activity and work during the day. And now we need to find the ways to get people realized and encouraged to work out at least three times per week and spend more time being active. But it is bad idea to force those people into doing sports activities because it may cause a big problem: they will be discouraged and obligated to do it. And eventually, that may end up in them being fed up with it, and they will give it up. It is essential to show them that it may be not only good for their mental and cognitive health but also fascinating and worth spending time on. The best way to do it is to build up a more developed sports sphere that will provide people with lots of opportunities to be active and spend time beneficially. For instance, the government may open up more gyms in the cities and provide them with brand-new appliances and good staff with lots of knowledge to train and encourage people to work out. It is extremely essential to not force anybody to do sports activities. They need to get encouraged and be willing to do it themselves. Otherwise, it may end up with bad results.

Hi Alex! I hope you are doing fine. I am sorry, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go to your party on Saturday. I forgot it's my brother's birthdays on Saturday and my parents have organized to go on a trip. My whole family is travelling to Brazil to celebrate it, and there's no chance I could stay here in Argentina. We would stay there for a week if I am right. However, we could meet next week if that's OK with you. We could hang out, go shopping in Rosario or maybe cycle. Apart from that, my parents allowed me to have a party at home the week after we return to the country. If you'd like, we could do it and we could invite all our school friends. Tell me what you feel about this and let me know as soon as possible so we can start planning everything. Your friend, Iva

When our parents went to school they could only use a book as a tool to study and follow lessons. However, in our current society, all has changed thanks to technology. Indeed, computers and tablets have got more accessible to everyone and as a consequence, a large percentage of students should have one or both of them in their respective houses. This is useful since you can browse the Internet for words or processes you don't understand. I have done it, especially when I had to understand the main steps of a biochemical process. On the other hand, it's considered by many parents that these devices could be a distraction during studying. It occurs because these devices permit us to do other activities, such as watching videos and listening to music. For each thing, there are pros and cons, but we make the most to do it correctly. From my perspective, computers and tablets won't be replacing books in school and university in the following years. The explanation is they would increase our inattention inevitably, making us get worse marks than with books.

In people's life, what they do and what they achieve defines their whole life. People always talk about what has recently happened to them or what they have done when there is a get-together. Joyful and fulfilled occasions always stay with people. For starters, personally I believe a shorter but more intense life is better than a very long and calm life. Of course I want to live long but if my only choice for a long life is living "calm" and doing nothing it is a dealbreaker. Furthermore, I want to do lots of things such as travelling, getting out most nights instead of sitting at home doing nothing, trying out new things. I want to make most out of my life, I want to make significant memories. As long as I am happy with my life and think that I have achieved what I have wanted to it does not matter at what age I will die. To move on, for me a calm life means a stable but dull time - spending as well as an intense life means a busy but a joyful journey. For example, just like most people, I want to have some kind of stable life like having a big comfortable house but I do not want to spend my whole life in that house. I want to travel, work hard, try out new things. I want to have a good, intense life. In conclusion, how much you've lived does not define the quality of your life. However, how much you've achieved does. Live fast, die young.

The program that is Write and Improve is very helpful because of these main reasons: It is very helpful because of these main reasons: The first reason is that it gives learners at any skill level the ability to greatly improve their English writing skills with some practice. After writing, you can test your writing level with official tests to see if you are at the skill level you think. Also, you can change your writing and it does not permanently stay there after you write once. There are at the bare minimum one hundred lessons for any skill level which is a lot of lessons to improve your writing. It also gives feedback for wrong words, forgotten words, wrong forms, tenses and whole sentences if there are any wrongly used words or misspelled words in that sentence. In the case of wrong words, it gives the correct word in a text box next to that wrong word that you can click on and see. You can even make your own tests in the program and give other people the ability to do your tests and share their results with you, as long as that person has already joined your workbook. There are classes you can make and join and view results of the students' lessons in your class. You can track your own writing, your activity and awards. You have a personal progress graph for the last ten checks in the program and a writing timer to keep track of your writing skills and the amount of time you need to do your writing. There is feedback, which is automatic, to say: "You have done great" or if you are wrong than it will say to look back at your writing time and skill level both in the past and present. You can also just write for fun in the program as well. There are all kinds of writings: essays, reviews, articles, reports and emails to study for the test in real life. In the program, you can see your writing and find your writings in a list without needing to search through every single one of your writings. Those writings have automatic grading that you and any outsiders can see. Also, you have a calendar of your amount of checks per day and your awards so your teacher can check what you are capable of doing and have done. You can't exploit the system by just repeating checks for a task lots of times. That is a very good aspect of that programme. The things that are worse about this program are: If you pass a certain word threshold that changes based on the difficulty of your writing by pretty much any means, it will just add some points to your total score even if your phrasing is worse or your sentences end with a gap. The only difficulty that I have with this tool is the scores are not very accurate. I would highly suggest this program, Write and Improve, to every English learner, whether you are a complete beginner or you have almost mastered English. There are a lot of great things in the program but sometimes things are a bit worse than expected. Overall, it is very good for learning writing.

Being even more important than exercise, in my personal opinion, our diet is the main thing to worry about in terms of healthcare. Without following a proper diet, our body can't work properly, as the diet provides the nutrients and energy necessary for our body to execute its daily activities. Also, most people don't realise how important our sleep is. Usually, for it to be considered a good night's sleep, a person needs to sleep between 6 to 8 hours a night. Furthermore, not only the quantity, but the quality of our sleep is really important, so make sure to eat healthily, do exercise, and be emotionally stable; it is very important. The conclusion we need to have here isn't about the most important factor, but it is about creating the whole picture together, like sleep, exercise, and diet. With all those balanced, I can guarantee your life will become a lot better, in terms of being productive, your mood, relationship, and your self-esteem.

I think that I would prefer the shorter life if this intensity is for good things. Because this could be an intensity of problems or bad situations. If this is the situation I'd prefer a calm life until 100 years old but if it is intense about good things like a wonderful trip or a gorgeous partner then I'd prefer the shorter life. This could be an easy answer for me because I don't plan or expect to live over 60 or 65 years. I think that I will live enough time to live a good life with my close people with many situations to remember. I could summarise this thought saying that it is better to have quality against having quantity. You have nothing if you live until 100 years old but without any important thing to remember or to tell. Until now I think that I have lived a good life with some bad things but the most of the time I have lived good things that give me amazing memories to tell to my children in the future. Now I have found the love of my life and I hope to live many years with her. And I think that a life of 65 years could be perfect to share with my love. I hope life could give this and also many good moments with her.

To begin with, travel, is one of my favourite hobbies, if not the most important one. A great part of my personality was built because of my travelling. Everything started when I moved to Australia for an exchange semester abroad. There, I could learn a new language and explore a totally different world and culture. Furthermore, in Australia, since it is a multicultural place, you can learn a lot about many other cultures. Also, with the advance of technology, travel is getting more accurate and accessible to more people, since the ways of transportation are getting more efficient, and travelling is becoming cheaper and quicker at the same time. At the same time, people working from home or remotely have created a whole new category of travellers, where countries who want to get benefits from these long term tourists, will have to create new places and entertainment for those so-called digital nomads. And not only for those, researchers are showing that in the future, people will work fewer hours due to automation, and new tools will be created. Consequently, there will be more time to consume goods, services, and of course do tourism. To me, this will be the most significant change.

Although some people do not mind light and noise while they sleep, I personally need a quiet and dark place to sleep.

On the one hand, zapping books at schools and colleges is an unreasonable scenario. It is a matter of fact that we are in the heyday of the information highway, but this does not mean the demise of the physical book. It is necessary to remember that not each school in the country is in the high echelons of wealth. There are thousands and thousands of students unable to have proper facilities conducive to learning. The underdog lives on the edge of society. There are people unable to purchase either top-notch tablets, cutting-edge computers, or expensive technologies. What is more, many cannot even afford proper food or necessities. On the other hand, if society is able to provide the proper conditions for living to all people, it would be a conducive scenario to change physical books to digital ones. Nevertheless, it does not mean that all physical books will disappear, so only textbooks are due to make it. Lots of individuals are attached to having the real thing and enjoying deluxe and hardcover editions. Colleges would benefit from format changes because they would have access to updated information.

Telling the truth is obviously essential. When we were children, we were taught not to tell lies, because it is wrong. Besides, we find hard to trust someone we caught telling a lie once. Therefore, it seems that always telling the truth is important. But I don't quite agree with this idea. In my opinion, telling the truth should always be preferred to telling a lie. However, there are a few situations where telling a lie enables us to preserve a good relationship, or the sensibility of a person. For instance, telling someone who is asking you whether his son died in an accident or not that, indeed, the son is dead is maybe not the best way to proceed. Rather than telling a brutal, violent truth which may shock or deseperate someone, a soft lie which leads to the truth could help this person to cope with this event when she learns about it. To lie should never be accepted, except on the occasions where it is a in a view to conceal a hard, shocking truth, or when it leads to the truth in a softer way. To conclude, it is essential to always tell the truth, except in the few situations where it is better to make a small concealment of a shocking truth .

That's a fact, the school that we know today is about to disappear. Most recent research studies have concluded that our current way of schooling was created in the industrial era, where people needed to be guided through all the steps, with a passive way of learning, which is basically absorbing content from a source. The content, in this case, is defined by an educational curriculum, and is passed on by the figure of a teacher or professor, depending on what environment you are based in. With the advance of technology, other skills and abilities are demanded from people to be able to perform and pursue a working career. But how to prepare people for this new world? In my opinion, the school of the future needs to focus on teaching people to learn how to learn. Today, with the internet, we no longer need the figure of a teacher as we know it, but instead a mentor who will guide a student on what to learn, and how to learn. We need to teach our kids to be self-learners, who will search for knowledge independently, adapting it to their own needs.

Firstly, education is very significant for people because people want to set themselves up for a great life in the future . Therefore, the first step is education. Education has a lot of methods. For example, students use books or technological equipment. In my opinion, students should prefer to use computers and tablets, but these shouldn't completely replace books in schools and universities because books are necessary for education. There are several students who prefer to use technological equipment, because it is faster, it includes a lot of information, and is more useful. The first reason is that students want to have information quickly. Also, they want to live an easy education life so, they prefer to use computers and tablets because getting information is very important for students. In addition, according to them it is very important that technological equipment is faster than books. The second reason is that books include a lot of information, but it isn't possible to include many topics in a book. Therefore, students can have a computer or tablet because these provide convenience for students. Another reason is that libraries are an absolutely necessary place for studying or researching, but they have a lot of options for books, so it isn't useful but technological equipments better because reach information easier. Finally, computers and tablets absolutely shouldn't completely replace books. Students need books and libraries all the time. Therefore, I think, they should prefer computers and tablets in schools and university.

The straightforward answer to your question is yes, television can also educate people, especially if we're talking about children. Furthermore, television isn't considered the best tool to educate, because it could compromise your concentration skills. Also, it is very limited, it could be used as one resource to search and absorb content, but you can't do much more than that. In my opinion, television could be a smart way to educate your children, as it can be funny and could focus the kid's attention on the television programs. Today, there are many education channels for children, and if they're not used in an exaggerated way, I guess, it can help in their education. For adults, on the other hand, I can't find it very useful for education purposes. Maybe when you are studying languages, it's nice to get used to the accent, and some more real-world vocabulary. To sum up, television is just a tool, like internet, books, etc. The secret for a good education is a dedicated mentor, who analyses and reflects on what kind of information is being consumed. The mentor, in the case of adults, can be you.

"The unknown need: music..." A lot of people think that music is just a composition of sounds, but there are more things to what music is. In my opinion, music can be some kind of mood stabilizer, or a mood enhancer, because it has the power to make us feel happy in hard moments, and vice versa. It's something that is beyond our understanding, so we can ask ourselves the next question: what would life be like without music? I'd say that life would be so monotonous. There wouldn't be that happiness in every reunion. Actually, a party is not a party without music. It's hard to think of a world without music, it'd be just like a soundless world, since this is another type of art that has had a lot of influence along the years in different areas.

In my opinion, I agree with the following statement: 'Computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities.' because of the three main reasons below: Firstly, there is the effectiveness of computers and tablets. For example, by using computers and tablets, students could access almost all books in a computer, so books won't be effective anymore. Also, you can make presentations which you can't make on paper and that's going to help students better understand the lesson that a teacher is teaching. Also, there are plenty of books in the libraries of all the schools, which could be replaced by computers. And that brings us to the second reason to agree with the statement above. Secondly, there is the school library. There are a lot of books in a library and you could easily make libraries more compact by having all the books on one computer and let the reader select the book they want on a computer and automatically borrow it. That would be a great idea for replacing books with computers in schools and universities. Also, you wouldn't need a receptionist at the library front desk, so it would be more efficient. Lastly, there is the efficiency of the learning and reading. The efficiency is pretty high because you can access pretty much everything from just computers and tablets. For the three main reasons above, I agree with the statement: 'Computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities.'

Music in our lives Music is an incredible thing. It's like magic. Music is a friend to me, a thinking tool used to clear my mind, and another form of communication. What I mean by this is that whenever I feel like I need to release any emotion, I hear music or make music, emotion is removed from my body, and the happiness I get takes over. Music is significant. People love music, and music is a great thing. It lets me know myself. To us, music is a second life. It is essential. Without music, the Earth is a quiet place without any happiness. Only war, fighting, and killing. Every night, have you ever dreamt of your mother singing you a lullaby? It's beautiful. With all the emotion spread away, you'll have a new life with more good things.
