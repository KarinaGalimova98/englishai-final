New Year is always an invite to establish goals for the next 365 days. There are some areas there I'm pleased like improving my idioms knowledge, writing, speaking, presenting scientific articles. There are also areas that I should improve like statistics, IA, algorithms and how to present a work I developed. So I need to have some strategies for achieving goals. 1 - Improving a new language: I need to study, daily, at least little time like 15 minutes. And this study includes writing, reading a lot. 2 - Presenting scientific articles: It's important to reach innovative findings, read, study and try to disseminate these new ideas. When I consider to be a presenter I need to study a lot. 3 - Improve my statistics knowledge: a challenge, but not impossible. As to achieve previous goals, I'll need to study sistematically and never give up. 4 - Understanding about algorithms - it's a new knowledge and very difficult to study for whom is not a specialty on this area but I think that if I'll be persistent I will learn. There are so much challenges but if I meet all my goals it will contribute to my happiness, of course.

There are people who say, no matter how long you live, but how you spend your life. So as for them, the quality of life is something that really matters. It would be hard to deny it, but on the other hand our desire to live is so strong and obvious that we are eager to extend the life span every possible way. In the first place, there are a lot of advantages of leading peaceful and long life. The longer you live the more chances to share your time with your love ones such as friends and family. Each day has its uniqe importance and beauty. People have opportunities to learn something new day in day out what makes the life purposeful and meaningful. But other people are eager to push their limits and try whatever possible in their lives. They appoint some goals themselves and feel the tremor of excitement when they try to achieve them. They range from simple things such as picking up a new skills to extremely dangerous sports such as caving or bungee jumping. For example: they want to see the ocean, drown in it and learn how to dive in its deep water. They feel in the heart of heart that only if they accomplish it, they will truly fulfill and exhilarated. Such people would like to live fully insted dull and tedious life without risky and adventurous situations. If I had to choose I would go for mediocre but longer life rather than spectacular but shorter. I would like to enjoy the life and people I love day by day for a long time, taking advantegous of each single joy.

What's the future of travel? Nowadays people can travel around a world almost without any limits. During the last 100 years people change the waythey travel. Even our grand parents spent days or weeks for travelling between continents. Ships were the fastest mode of travelling. Then airlines started offer their services and now we can flight in 24 hours around the glob. People trying to developed new ways of transport to minimise lengh of travel. On the other hand we are looking beyond the horizon of the glob, we are interesting for travel into space. There are two companies which work for making travelling in space more accessible. It is a big chance that in a short future people will start travelling in to a space. At the beginning it could cost a fortune for ordinary people but it will change when more companies will developed their technology and services. It will still remains we will move from one place to another but we will use different mode of transport, maybe we will sleep during the trip to minimise the cause of traveling in space becasue we still don't know the impact on our body and mind when travelling on space.

First, I would like to say thank you for requesting me to write this request in this amazing magazine. As you already know, I will write about "The School Of The Future." I will especially write about in what ways do you think schools will be different in the future and in what ways might they still be the same. I think schools will be different in the future by accepting ICT ecuipments such as projectors, sound boxes and so on. I think by using these exuipments, it will be so efficient and both students and teachers will be able to facilitate their classes very smoothly in the future. On the other hand, schools will still be the same by offering school lunches. I believe that we need school lunch dietitian to insure students' individual health. School lunch dieticians should also keep a good hygiene during school lunch time. I think a good hygiene is very important when it comes to insuring students' individual health. Plus, school lunch time should be a lot of fun! I think we need some nice topics to talk about and we need many laughter during lunch time! It must be a lot of fun for students! I like schools today, but I believe that future schools will be better and better by having a great balance between accepting a new technology and mainting an old schools' tradition.

We enjoyed delicious food in a local, traditional restaturants. We spend a wonderful time travelling across island. Malorca is not a big island, so tourists have an opportunity to visit almost every corner of this amazing place. We enjoyed sun bath in the evening when the temperature fallen. Travelling by car we had a chance to stop in every placese we wanted. In my opinion everyone will find something interesting to see. I really recommend i. e. closter, colorful horbours, beautiful small bays, caves and mountains. I do believe that due to many interesting places, tasty food, nice weather conditions and friendly people this was our best holiday ever.

---"Television entertains, but can it also educate?"--- if I would answer this question, I would say "Yes.." I have a reason to support this statement. Firstly, I of course agree that television entertains by showing audiences variety shows, quiz shows, comedy shows and so on. Usually, this kind of TV shows are very popular among kids and teenagers. In fact, I also enjoy watching these types of TV shows. I laugh a lot, or sometimes, I even cried because I feel impressed or I was moved. Moreover, TV can also educate by broadcasting about recent news, science, social studies and so on. Of course, learning something in school and learning something from workbooks are also important, but I think TV shows will also be part of education. On TV, you can learn things that can't be taught in school, and they can sometimes be very educational for kids like us. in conclusion, I think that we should live well with mass media like television, and I believe that will lead us to a better live in the future.

Money cann't buy happiness or serenity. It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. I am in totally agreement with that. Health cann't be replace by anything. There is a lot of rich people are ready to give up their wealth just to become healthy. Some illness cann't not be cure even with all the money in the world. Sick people have to go through the pain and the fear of losing there life. They wish if there anything to do to help themslves. I remember one of my dad friend has a rare disease. He traveld around the world and spend all of his money just to find a cure. But sadly he diead after a tragic journey of trying find the medication. Eventually, I learned from that situation that health is most important thing in life . Besides, it is agift from god that deserve to be grateful for it.

In my opinion television lost their education role for entartaining. Since TV become a cash cow for advertisers we watch more ads in than valuable television productions. People watch more low quality television series and reality shows instead of education programs. People become lazy, we are busy and overworked and we expect more fun and joy. Solid production are less popular in comparison to shows and soup comedy. I think the reason is only money. More valuable production costs more and demand more commitment. Only a few tv stations try to go extra mile and create high valuable productions. I really concern about it that tv has changed in this way but we should remember that even world has change too and event tv has addapted to the market. Every country has a government tv station and in my opinio governments should use this media to educate citizen. The smartest people we are the less worries we have.

It's a very good subject. How the trips will be on the future. I am not good wondering about future, but I think travelling will be easier because we are going to have many sorts of transportation. On the future, maybe there will be flight cars or automated vehicles. As drivers will not be necessary, everyone will be passengers and enjoy better the trip. The most important thing will be the security. Without any war we will be able to travel in peace, people, especially women, will be respected, so to travel alone will not be dangerous. Airplanes will be able to fly longer and distances between places will be nearest in time. That means, trips will be less distressful and tiresome. Probably astronomical trips will be available. So we will have some travellers to the Moon or other planets and we will come back safely. In these trips we will admire the stars, the sun, we will have another point of view of our solar system and be astonished with our big blue earth.

When technology is going to improve, people are using every areas from technology their lives. In my opinion books are the more important things in our life. if you want to learn anything you should read a lot of books. Instead of book using computers or tablets, it was very expensive some country. When the students are going to school or universities,using books for teaching process. For the education not only use a computer or tablet . Every tools should use same time. Books, Computer, tablet or ethernet etc. This is useful for students. This is a methodology for teaching.

In this century, Mobile phone has become indispensable part of our personal and professional life. We use it to connect and communicate with our love one, clients, boss and other people around us. And with smartphone, some people use it for business purpose. Young millionaires have been using mobile phone to create customer engagement and sell products worth more than million. Many employees also use it as a main tool for working remotely. Banning mobile phone usage in public space will interupt a main channel for communication respectively and cuase a massive inconvenience. However, using mobile phone in public space can trigger several joint problems. In some spaces like library and movie theater, mobile phone ringtone and blue light can disturb people nearby and ruin the serenity environment of the space. Having long and loud conversations via mobiles on public transportation disrupt the peace of the journey and distract other concentration. And the loud noise can spread the negative emotion. Another drawback of using mobile phone in public spaces especially government service and hospital is that it annoy professional officers who are focusing and doing their job. In my opinion, Instead of imposing bans, town concil should allow people to use moblie phone with some restriction and encourage people to use mobile phones and other electronic equipment with consideration for others.

It's a debatable issue whether one opt for a calm life where they are following the same routine every day or intense life full of excitement and challenges. I personally believe that life should be challenging and deep enough so that we can be remembered by all other people till the time life exist on universe. To embark with, intense life has it's certain benefits. The one most common one is that such a life teach you new and different skills required to solve issues further boosting your confidence level and making you famous. To illustrate this, the famous scientist Einstin belonging to a small village accept the challenge and invented the bulb which further made him a famous scientist and still remembered by all of us. Secondly, such a life is more happening and lively to live till the end, as compared to the calm and steady life which is good for an initial time but after some time you easily gets bored with such a life as we are following the same routine from many years. For example, recent survey conducted by The Times newspaper shows that people living in hilly area those who are doing same kind of work does not have any excitement for life as compared to city people. To sum up, it's only the intense quality of life which helps an individual to learn new methods and techniques, further boosting their confidence level to accept new challenges of life and making them famous personalities.

I think train and aeroplane will be faster: in my opinion, scientist soon will develop a prototype which is able to go from Londo to New York in a very short time.

In this decade, we ran into many innovations that were improved by technology. Many of them are used easily by people because the producers of those products have been providing new models every year such as computers, tablets or smartphones. People get used to these devices and use them their whole lives. Hence companies increase their sales figures. Everyone is grateful for technology and they do not want to turn back to old techniques like books, magazines or newspapers. For example, nowadays children prefer computers,tablets or the internet to learn something, so that situation reminds us of this question “ Should computers and tablets replace books in educational areas of study? ” In general, technology has a lot of magnificent benefits. If we talk about educational situations, it has even more benefits. For instance, tablets and e-readers are very useful for students because you can take note of anything without a pen. It stores as much information as 3 or 4 libraries do. Simple, quick and useful. Furthermore, using that product is a good way to prevent deforestation because every year many trees are cut down to publish a book. On the other hand, many scientists suggest that books are a good guide to learn because when you look up any information but you can not see quickly review, you have to keep to scanning until you find it. So, you have more chance to memorize after you finish your searching. In my opinion, both sides have good benefits but I support the idea that books should still be in schools and universities. Before using new technological innovations, every people should try old techniques to see if they work for them.

Books and technology I am a music teacher. I work at a small school. All the students receive the music notes in paper form. But the newest trend is to work with a tablet. We do not need paper and for the environment is this good. At the moment is my biggest work to scan all my music notes that I need. My tablet is very good but I have to learn to need it. The biggest question is:"What is the easiest way to find my grades on the computer?" Ore only I have a computer the students do not have them. Also a problem is, that not all schools have wireless to send a message to print what I need. At the moment is this for me the future. The primary schools have the facility and the students learn early to work with a computer. I see the problem not in the school but at home! The children are often alone at home and they do not only work for the school on the computer the temptation is to surf in the internet. We all know what happens next.

Dear Charlie, Today, I'm writing this email to tell you about my favorite film. My favorite film is "Sound of Music" Starring Julie Andrews. Because I'm a music lover, I like this movie very music. It has lots of singing, dancing, and most importantly, actors' acting skills are so high and they're so talented. I was impressed by that. As a music lover, I watch it over and over again, even now. I think it's one of the best movies and it won so many awards including Oscars, Golden Globe and so on. I remembered that you also like music as me, so, I'm sure that you are going to like the movie very much. Watch the movie whenever you can, and give me a comment of the movie in the reply. I'm looking forward to it. Can't wait to hear your comments!

My favourite film is " The hate you give." The filmis about a black young men who got shot from a white cop without any reason. The white cop shot him because he thinks that the young black man has a gun but it was only a cump. When all this happened, there was a young black girl with him and she saw all of this injustice. But after all that happened the cop didn't get a clean bill of health because he only shot a black man. Then the girl stood up for the right of the dark skinns and sought justice for her shot friend. I love that film because it shows the real life and injustice. It is a real story and very sicnificant and I think people can learn about the film.

Do you ever imagine the school of the future? Schools in the future will certainly be different from the school of nowadays? How will they be? Will they be better or worse than now? Firstly, I believe that new schools will be more digital: pupils will study on computers and teachers will work with videos and other digital devices. I think that this will have a positive effect. The positive effect is that students will have fun in learning. There won't be any homework. This will be very good as students will have more time available for their hobbies and to do what they want. Teenagers will also be able to get a little job, in order to earn some money. I would be very glad about that because teens would be able to work and study at the same time. Moreover, I think that students won't only study traditional subjects . This will be nice because pupils who aren't keen on studying will have the possibility to learn something else. I hope that school will improve in the best way.

--- MY REASONS FOR LEARNING ENGLISH --- By School Newspaper Hi, everyone, how are you? Today, we are writing this school newspaper to report the result of questionnaire. We asked other students following question. --- What is the biggest reason to study English? --- Many respondents answered "To make my life fruitful.." ---> 65% Some said, they learn English "To expand the field of activity.." ---> 25% Another said, "Now we're living in the 21st century and it's society of globalization, it will surely come in handy in the near future.." ---> 5% Rest of the students had a different opinion. (Other) ---> 5% From this questionarrie, we can see that different person has a different opinion. I think that's good. We must accept each other's' opinion. In my case, I'm studying English because I have a certain aim that I want to atchive in the future. I strongly believe in saying "Hard work Does pay off.." I am going to study English hard, and I hope that I will be able to atchive my goal in the near future.

Now I am thinking of changing my way in studying like solving more menistery books or taking more lessons in the subjects that I am not really good at it. I could also search on the internet for vedios that explain the deficult lessons. Other way is writing a summarization for each lesson. I may also have a partener in studying,this will be interesting and it will be useful for both of us. This is useful of a result of collecting ideas and information.

It is often said that health is wealth and we should give it more importance than money. I agree with the statement because healthy people can live independently. However, I believe that money is equally important to live a healthy life. Some people believe that healthy people are less dependent on their family. It allows people to concentrate on work and quickly learn new things. Nowadays, big firms prefer to hire people with new skills and healthy. This help them earn money for a longer time. In this way they save money for later and use them wisely. For instance, a report from 2012 at Oxford university found that the healthier people learn 5 times faster than the people who cannot concentrate. Therefore, health must be taken seriously. I think the money play a vital role in keeping you healthy. People can buy organic food which are most healthy and costly. They are less prone to most of the diseases born in food items and stay healthy for a longer time. For example, a survey, in India, found that the 90% of the rich people eat food items grown in their farms organically. To sum up, health is important to be rich. We should not ignore money.

When I saw it the first time I did not understand all, but every time I understand it better. The story tells from a young man in the university. He has a very good friend but in the reality he does not exist. It need a long time to detect that he is schizophrenic. But the life means good with him. He has a wonderful wife and with her help he quits university and is appointed professor. The highest point was the Nobel prize in mathematik for him.

My best holiday ever was on December 3-4, 2019. I went with my family to Barcelo Montelimar Beach which is an all included three-stars hotel. It is located on Montelimar Beach at Nicaraguan's Pacific Ocean. We were celebrating my daughter birthday. My husband and me decided to not celebrate with a children party because it is more stressful for me, so I wanted to rest and enjoy vacation. The hotel has 4 pools, one of them is the biggest pool in Central America. Also, the hotel has a pool just for children from 0 to 8 years old. I was fantastic for my daughter who is only 5 years, but the she got bored. My son enjoyed a lot eating many fried potatoes and hot dogs because I usually don't allow him to eat junk food. Also he swam in the pool all day long and play base ball with her father on the beach. Also we enjoy as a family in the restaurants and talent show activities where my daughter danced with the clowns.

Telling the truth Most people I know believe that you should never tell a lies,which is completely correct and understandable. Nevertheless, in my personal opinion it is not always possible to tell only the truth. In some cases I even believe that it is acceptable to tell a lie. Some lies can save you from bad situations. Complex situations need complex resolutions. Other lies can help you to achieve your goals,but I do not support these kinds of lies,because it is not right to lie in order to get what you want. This is just rude and unfair towards people who are trying to achieve their goals,but without lies like normal,good human-beings. I would like to give you some examples of situations in which I feel like it is acceptable to lie. There are not many of them,but they exist. The first situation is when you are in direct danger and someone threatens you. For example when you called the police,but when they ask you if you called someone ,you say that you did not call anyone. Otherwise if you would say the truth, you could put yourself even in bigger danger. The second situation is when you do not want to hurt someone. You heard your best friend gossiping about your sister and because you do not want to hurt your sister´s feeling you do not tell her about it. She would be extremely upset by it. But in general I do agree that lies are bad.

I think the follwing three things may be more important than exercise for our health. The first is diet. We have to eat a meal to get good nutrition like a protein, a fat and vitamins and so on. Because the nutrition is the source of power,we cannot move our body perfectly without good diet. The second is rest especially sleeping. If you run short of sleep,you cannot control your body and your mind correctly. Besides short sleep is bad for your health because your immune system weaken. Third I think the most important for our health is keeping good mental conditions. First of all you have to keep your mental health if you want to get good phyisical health. To get good mental conditions,you should maintain your thoughts. You should sometimes refresh your mind for exmple playing with friends or drinking with colleagues or having dinner with your family and so on. A good health is whrere a good mental conditions.

A new year started, here in Liceo Classico. We are all returning back from our vacations, and it's now time to focus on the goal we want to reach this year. I am really interested in Greek. This year we will start studying Greek poetry and I can't wait to do so. Saffo's words have always enchanted my mind and now I am really excited to learn something more about her stile and her living. However, I am not interested only about Greek. I know this year we will start to study English literature too, so I know it is a really great opportunity to improve my English. I would really like to be able to get the English certification this year or maybe the next. To achieve my goals I will work hard, because I know that nothing comes from nothing. I want to build my future day after day, learning as much as it is possibile. Every new skill I get it is a bigger chance to get what I want in life.

I really like to travel around the world, especially with my boyfriend. For the moment we go for low cost vacations, we don't really have much money. We've gone to Kracow two years ago and we've stayed there for a week. Although Poland became part of the European Union, they still don't have the Euro. For this reason it is really convenient for us European people to spend a period there: one Euro values four of their Zloty. Moreover, Krakow is rich of history: we've seen lots of interesting buildings, from Synagogues to castles. In Krakow there is a strong Hebraic culture, they have seven Synagogues, all set in the same district. In the older Synagogue there's now a museum, but other ones are still used to pray and to celebrate religious functions. The Kupa Synagogue, so small but so colourful, is one of the most beautiful monument I ever visited. One hour and a half by bus from Krakow there are Birkeanau and Auschwitz Lagers, two of the saddly famous German Lager in where Nazists imprisoned Hebras during Nazist Regyme. I strongly reconmend everyone to visit these places, to realize how human being can be cruel and not to forget.

I think the following three things may be different in the future. First the way of accesseing and its speed. the train and the car may bo more faster than now and new machine which we cannot imagine may happen to appear someday. Second,The place where we can go. In near future we can go to the moon or mars. Besides we can go to another planets for the future. Third the spot of sight seeing and traditional spot may decrease due to worldwide globarization and the number of information. Otherwise the following three things will be the same in the future. The first is communication with people who live there. It is one of the main purpose now and in the future. Second troublesome packing is always tired. Third we are very tired after come back home. The different point may much differ than I thought but the same point may be true. Besause the journey is what change onself and very hard.

Telling the truth could be painful. However, it's always more valuable than telling a lie. Honest and truthful people are always loved in their communities. Therefore, lies that have been told by dishonest people probably could lead to greater problems and trust issues. Societies always respect and adore truthful people. Moreover, it's not acceptable to tell a lie even if the truth will be difficult to deal with. Being an explicit and straightforward person is more preferable than being known as a liar. I remember one time my friend lied to me about something. When I found out that she was lying and that she told me false information I was enraged with her. Furthermore, the respect and trust that I have for her was broken. I could really appreciate it if she had just told the truth. The matter could not adjust any more suitable by telling a lie. Nevertheless, it will make the situation even worse. Some people choose to be implicit to avoid facing a specific problem. For example, my friend Sara has a problem with our friend Suzy. For that reason, Their relation was imperfect, so Suzy asked her what is the problem? Having no problem with her that was Sara's response to the question. Despite the confrontational choice Sara just ducked Suzy. As a result of that, ultimately they stopped talking to each other. Which they could obviously avoid by being honest to one another.

In my opinion, the exercises are imprtant for our health, but its aren't enough. Our health is a key to our happiness. In the first time, healthy food is as more important as that exercises. We must eat fruits, vegetables. For our health, we must cook the healthy food: chicken with vegetables, fish with rice, soups and the deserts just like fruits: apples, pears, pineapples, kiwi, grapefruits. In the second, I think that our happiness is more important. The life is all about problems, stress, run and run again.

Today is 1 September, today is autumn. This summer was incredible. I visited tree countries: France, Italy and Romania. I like Romania very much, but the Paris is my favourite. I think that French people are happy all the time. They really smile all day. I love their food: pizza, pasta, burgers and croissants. This country is amazing. I saw the celebrity "Le Tour Effel" and the cathedrial "Notre Damme." I visited a lot of parks and gardens. Italy is very beautiful too. But I think the France is my favourite country because France is more clean that Italy and people are more educated. Romania is home for me and that's all. Home is love, home is the most beautiful thing that I know. Romania has beautiful places with smart people and Romania growing up every day. I was in Sibiu, Brasov, Constanta, Sinaia.

Yes it is, Health is important but it is not to be healthy than to be rich, I think both are important to live a good life because health and wealth can make our life happy and easy for example, if you have a lot of money and you a rich man you can buy a car to go everywhere and every place you want in any time also when you are rich you can marry and make a family even you can buy an apartment and you can eat healthy every day, Also when you are in a good health you can sleep very well and you and you can work and exercise and play football and each game you want, but when have one of these " heath or wealth" that is mean you will have trouble in your life because if you are not a rich that is mean you are a poor person and when you be a poor person you do not have money to buy a car or eat well or buy apartmen, Also if you are rich and you do not have a good health that is mean you not sleep very well and you can not play any game also you can not work and walk. I think you should balace the health and the wealth in your life to live in a good life. so that is what I have today see you in the next day with a new essay, I am Ali and thank you

Thanks to the spread of the internet we can have many choices the way of studying. We need not go to school because we can study subjects to connect to the internet. We can enter the school which is located far from you or abroad. We can make the style of our school of the future autmatic using the internet,but I think the real school of the future doesn't change a lot. Because what we should do in school is not only studying subjects but also getting our social mind. For student what is most important to learn is how we face with the defficult problems. we learn it with your friends and classmate and some time people who you hate. social mind cannot learn where you are alone. So the school of the future will be convenient thanks to the internet but will not change its essence at all.

I am writing about my best season of the year. I do believe that all seasons of the year are important and we can not possibly remove or change one. However, I do prefer two seasons than the others. Firstly, I like summer and that seemingly quite common, the majority of people have constantly chosen this season as their favourite one. there is no doubt about that. Summer season is commonly prefered due to the weather and the temperature. Summer waether is the perfect weather ever, with less rain and sunlight brightly shining, most people see it as a great period of time for a picnic or playing outdoors. Temperature is another factor, peole find comfortable because they do not have to wear many clothes because the temperature is more than perfect.

It depends on how people think about this. An extream argument is quite meaningless here. For example even if you are very rich,it is meaningless to live on the bed for life or even if you have good condetion,it is meaningless that you have no money. It is nonsense. Of course Both of thwm are important. For me I come to think that to be healthy is important as I am an older. It is clear that I cannot live and feed my family if I couldn't earn enough money. Of course if I am not rich,the choise the way of daily life and what I can do on holiday. But the basis of daily life is family health. Because we are healthy enough,we come to have a desire such as to be rich. If we are not healthy,all we want is to be healthy I guess. Therefore my opinion is that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich.

Why I must learn English is that it is the minimum requirements for me to be a doctor. To be a doctor I have studied for 4 years to go to the university but I couldn't pass the exam. When I gave up the dream being doctor,The only way it was left for me is to study at medical university in Bulgaria. So all the lectures are spoken in English,I must study English. Generally speaking to learn Engrish give you some good eforts. For example because the population of speaking English is the most biggest in the world, we can learn a worldwide common sense through communication with them. Another reason why it is better for us to learn English is to make many friends. To make friends who are from various countries is good for you because you can get chances that you think about other people and it can spread or change your mind. This is why to learn English is important to us.

English is the most studied language in the world and it is a compulsory subject in all school. I have also been learning English for eight years at school. So why is learning English so important? Firstly, English may be very useful to you for your work. The world is getting even more globalized, and you will need to be able to interact with people who come from all over the world. If you cannot speak English, you won't be able to apply for an important position in your work. So English will ve very useful if you want to succeed in your job. In addition, learning English is vital if you like travelling. When you go abroad, no one will be able to talk to you in your mother tongue. So you need to know English to communicate with people. Otherwise you will get in big problems. Finally, English is essential in your life, so begin learning it!

Since the date of its invention, television has become even more important in our life. In fact, we love it because it is able to entertain us. Many people claim that watching television is unhealthy and useless. However, it can also teach you something. Children spend a lot of time on television. While it is true that there are programmes for children which are poor of quality, there are some good cartoons which are educative: children may learn a foreign language from them or you can find programmes which teach vital values such as friendship and loyalty. Obviously, parents must limit the time their children spend watching TV. Moreover, there are also wonderful programme for grown-up people. The might be about sports or cooking. In addition, there are programmes about health, politics, economics and so on. There are also great documentaries. They are about all types of science, so they can be very interesting. However, in my view, too few people watch documentaries, also because they are not advertised enough. To sum up, TV programmes can be good or dreadful: it is up to you to do the best choice.

It is widespread and common that people think it is not a problem if they lie once or more often. Other people think differently and are convinced that telling the truth is one of the most important things. In the following I am going to explain my opinion wether lying is acceptable or not. In my opinion is telling the truth a very important thing. It is a great character trial that many people have lost. I believe in the bible which is telling me that lying comes from the devil. The devil is the biggest lyer on earth. It means lying is not acceptable for God. The question is why. For sure, first lying looks not like a problem. It has advantages to lie, too. When I did not make my homework and my teacher wants me to read them out, it may be logical that I lie and say that I do not find them or however. And even if other people ask me something about a secret for example and I cannot tell them, then it is also common that people lie. Is it not understandable? Sure, it is hard to answer. Especially, when it is not just about my advantages but about others. But all in all I would still think that lying is not the best way. Basically you can hurt people with lying and it cannot be the way to lie because of loving. Who loves, tells the truth. I am convinced that telling the truth is a good way to improve the wolrd. How many problems are created, just because people decided to lie? Yes, it is not acceptable. To lie is a sin.

I think that learning to speak a foreign language is more and more important than past . Of course for the sake of the invention of the high quority transrator we may not need to learn a foreign language. But when you meet someone as a business or you make friends,to communicate with each other face to face is the best way to make and keep good relationship. Learning a foreign language also leads to understand their culture. It will be your legacy. Another reason why we learn a foreign language is that we get more and more chances to speak to people from varied countries. The invention of an air plane and a bullet train we can travel all over the world. And the improving of infomation technologies mainly the internet can make us communicate with each other even if we are in different countries. Threrfore learning a foreign language is more important than the old time.

Hi Billal!, Last week some of my classmates and I went to compete at a competition at London in the UK! We went to see some of the historic and touristic places at London, and stayed in a school with students from all around the world. It was a long journey from Mexico to the UK, but it was worth it. We also won 2 competitions!, the first one was the talent show and the second was about a writing one. I enjoyed this trip because I got to learn a lot about English and made new friends. Bye Billal!

Nowadays we well know that if you have a healthy living you will be more delighted with your self. Firstly is undeanible that exercise is important for our health as a result of having a good physcal apparence and maybe for having a good quality of life because if you move your body you would get distracted from the thing that you have been doing before. Secondly have balanced diet is an important point to consider because if you eat healthy you will be in fitness. Therefore, you might increase you fitness and also your psychological condition.

Beside with that firends could be very necesary in your life because with them you can improve your lifestyle and your psychological condictions. In conclusion, from my point of view I think that the exercise couldn't be most important thing about have a healthy living because there are a lot of things that it could be more essential.

I completely agree with this stament. It's more important to be healthy than to be rich. Health it's more important because the money could run out, and also money enables people to exert influence over others, and this isn't a good things. But, sadly money is vital for survival. Money, in my opinion is a little consolation to those who are suffering from health problems. Despite the fact that with the money you can pay for the best medical treatment and care available this is no guarantee of a longer life. Even if an individual is extremely rich, this does not necessarily lead to happinness, but in some cases, is the opposed. The rich people think that with money they can buy all, sadly love too, but genuine happiness cannot be bought. At the end, the money can be an important thing in life, but healthy is more important than the others.

Learning a foreign language is more important these days as it was in the past. The cause is the globalization. Now English is the most widely spoken language all around the world, is the language of economics, of science. Now, when you looking for a job, companies look language skills, because nowadays companies cooperate with foreign companies and speak a foreign language is very important work-wise. In the past learning a foreign language was only for rich people, that can pay expensive language courses, now, for example, English is begins to be taught in elementary school and continues to be taught until high school together, in some casesm with other foreign languages. The foreign languages that can be taught on high school are French, German and Spanisch, but also in Russina and Chinese in some cases. In sum, learn a foreign language widens the knowledge also in the work field.

Books and technology is an interesting essay. Nowadays technology is everywhere in our life. This development, however, have pron and cons. Technology can help us, but I think that human mind cannot be replaced. Sadly, now compurter and tablets, are slowly replace books in schools and university. Now, the students prefer "google" a resume of a book than read them. They prefer translate piece of novel on the net than using dictionary, and this is a very sadly fact. Quite all the young people never went to a library, because nowadays surfing the net, can find everything we are looking for. At university quite all the course are composed of multimedial material too, that's why at university there are some workers-students who cannot attend the lessons at the university. At the end technology help students to raise the knowledge but the parents of young people must involve children to read books and also go to libraries too!

Hey, Elena, how are you going? I didn't heard so much from you in the last two weeks. I hope that you are well. In the last semester, I had a so stressful time, so I used the winter semester break to relax. In the vocation I have watched lots of films, most of them are science fiction films, criminal thrillers, and Japanese animated films. Actually, I really found my favorite one: Spirited Away, a Japanese animated coming - of - age fantasy film. Spirited Away tells story of Chihiro Ogio, a 10-year-old girl who, while moving to new neighborhood, enters the world of kami (spirit) of Japanese Shinto folklore. After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to human world.

In my honest opinion is so important say always the truth with your partener, parents, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever, for example, when you are dating with another person it is so beautiful to be honest, if you are unhonest is so worst, nobody never will believe you, because you're always lying. The truth is like a dish, if you broke this dish just a time, this dish will never be the same, you have only a chance, never two or three, just one chance. Furthermore it so incredible when you find a person, when always you can believe in this person with you close eyes, and your family too. In addition always everyone never lie to your family, because our family are our reason to live, when you're sick or whatever, you have only a family to take care you, if you do not have a family, it is not a problem, because I'm sure that you have a person care about you, if you live alone, it is not a problem too, we must love ourselves , if you do not believe yourself, who will believe in you. Therefore this is my opinion about the importance to say always the truth with whatever person in the world, I recommend that, it is good to mental health and to everyone

I had many great holidays but the last one was the best This one was different because it has learning purpose . Instead if going to a hotel we went to a camp. The trip was in Spain . There we met a person called MR. Jackson who was sent us to camp for learning how to deal with Forest. And its wild animals . There was a tall man called MR. . Browne who taught us how to treat animals and how to prevent them from harming us if they are hungry. We learned what to do with animals. We also had a lot of fun like watching the sunrise in the morning. It was the most beautiful sunrise I had ever seen . We took many pictures . When we finished learning we had a week to explore things about animals to fill a book of facts about the forest and we should present it to the teacher after this week . When we were going back to Egypt we felt upset because we left the camp. It was the best holiday ever.

Hey, Jessica, Although it is already too late, I still want to say "Happy Birthday to my dear Jessi" and wish you happy every day. My birthday is in July. For my last birthday, I got a concert ticket from my boyfriend. It was an open air concert of Andrea Bocelli, a brilliant Italian Singer. I love his songs so much. And our visit was also very pleasant. However, my family doesn't celebrate any birthday except that of my grandpa. The reason is that in China people think only the birthdays of grandparents are important enough to celebrate. But this doesn't mean that I'm less important to my parents. Furthermore, my parents don't celebrate their birthdays as well. So it is just a cultural difference.

Nobody wants to be one who is told a lie, but hardly anybody avoids telling them. Even if this is true it is in my opinion acceptable to lie in the situations I will consider know. It is totally appropriate to lie if the truth would hurt someone so badly, that it could not be forgot again. Imagine the grandfather of your child is already dead and your beloved son is asking you wether he would have liked to play with him or not. If you tell him then, that his grandfather would never do that, because he was against your pregnancy from the beginning on, he would be hurt tremendously. Of course you know the best who can take the truth and who is not strong enough to do so. The second case where a lie is better than the truth is when the truth would cause unnecessary trouble, tension or fear at the wrong moment. People are used to reacting very outrageous in certain situations. If your wife has a skiing accident you had better not tell your children while they are still taking their skiing lessons. The only result would be lots of tears and that would mean more stress for you. Of course you should tell them in the end, but at the right moment. Telling the truth is not always easy but still hardly never the wrong choice. Yet if one of the situations above is the case, telling the ugly truth is not the only choice you have.

The school of the future will be very different than the school of now in a lot of ways. Firstly, in the future we will have jobs that asks different skills than now. I believe that we need people who have good computer technological skills. So the jobs in the future will be different, so the schools should also be different otherwise we will gate a society where the most people don't meet the skills that we need to run our economic. Nowadays, most of the schools use books but in the future we will have schools without books. Every student is using something like laptop or tablet to write notes and to make schoolwork. Furthermore, I believe that we can have schools where Robots and IA are teaching the students. To have teachers who' re able to use these technologies, we have to start now learning the skills that we need in the future. For example learning how to simulate programme to solve problems like climate change. However I don't believe that the schools in the future will be significant different than now, because the base material of the most subjects like Chemistry and maths will be the same

Dear sir, Your plan to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants has come to my attention. I think it is a great initiative to talk about the use of mobile phones in public spaces, but I do not think that the phones should be banned. Most people use their phone for a variety of tasks, they need to have their phones on them while they travel. I do think it is important that people become aware of the fact that it is antysocial to use your phone in shops and restaurants. It is a matter of education in my opinion. We shouldn't focus on banning stuff. Everybody should be free to make their own decision. Children in school should be taught how to deal with the constant distraction of phones opposed to telling them to put the thing away. I am convinced that in ten years time we will have a better understanding of how mobile phones work and what they do to our social life. We should not forget hat it is a very useful machine, it allows us to keep in touch with people we love, and gives us the opportunity to look up anything we want to or need to know. I would like to come and talk to you at the council, I'm looking forward to your reply. Kind regards, Leonie Patterson

I know from my experiences that exercising is vital part of human life. It is not just about being physical fit. It is much deeper. Of course, if you are fit, most of the things are easier for you, you feel better and you even feel better about yourself and it improves your life. But it is not the most important part for me. What I see as the key aspect of exercising is improving your mental strength. You have to suffer to grow. Nothing easy can make you better and if you can do something physically demanding every day, you can improve your brain and make yourself stronger and better. You can use it it aspects of everyday life. You need to get aout of your comfort zone and feel the pain and most importantly to handle it. And the best way to do it is by exercising. So, I doubt that you can find something really more important because exercise is basic part of your life and you need proper basics.

I am an Englsih learner who is doing all his best to pass the Cambridge C1 exams, and I always look for every tool that can help me to get my goal. I jumped into a new internet site where is given the opportunity to make some impromevents, especially in the part where students are weaker. This is because I am practicing some types of writings with the help of the new site I discovered. The site seems well-managed and it gives all the tools whose use is expected to get satisfactoty results. The main feature I appreciate is to choose what kind of writing I want to practise: an essay, a report or an article, in other words all the tasks that I could be required writing. It should not be forgotten the section "task timer" that makes you sure about the time you are spending in every single writing so that you can organise your time in a free-risk way. however, I must admit I have some difficulties for example when I must decide which task to do, and it depends on the length of the title task; it would be better a shorter one. On the whole, I strongly recommend to surf the site, making the registration process and being patient before seeing all the improvements you want to make. Hard study is the successful key. There are no doubts about its usefullness, tasks are sending to an examiner who will write you back the corrections and the stressed mistakes.

Write and Improve is a simple tool for improving language skills. I just started using it and I have to admit that it can really help you. By entering texts to provided tasks you train your ability to use a foreign language. Moreover, it is possible to get a feedback in the end. Due to the correction, you can focus on your individual weaknesses in order to turn them into strengths. Though some of the topics may seem a little bit out of context, it is a good possiblitiy to train yourself. Concerning the tasks itsselves it would be necessary to focus on relevant topics for exams in my opinion. Maybe I just have to explore whether there are any tasks I would like to do. Still, I would highly recommend using "Write and Improve" since no similar program exists at the moment.

The school of the future To start with, it has to be mentioned that school nearly stayed the same for decades. However, a real change is definitely needed. How this may look like? Nobody knows yet, but some ideas already exist. First, grades in general will be abandoned because they do not lead to a higher student motivation any more. What is more is that they only create much more pressure that keeps students from being interested in school. Therefore, I think the emphasis should be put on how to get kids to learn voluntarily. If there is a good relationship between teachers and students the results will be better as well. On the other hand some structures will possibly last. Organising classes in separate rooms is still up to date. Furthermore I think that books will also stay for a few more years just because kids should remember how it is to use them. Maybe there are even other changes we could not imagine nowadays. Let's just wait and find out.

My reasons for learning English An activity is always started because of an initial intention. Going to the gym in order to get fit or watching TV to learn something about other countries, for instance. For me learning English is something I do not want to stop in the near future. The main reason may be clear: Improving language skill will help me in my future business as well as in my general life of work. However, for me, there is more than this side of a coin. First I want to travel a lot and the language needed is English. Of course, other languages would be useful as well. Still I think that English is the most important one. Due to the many people who have at least a basic knowledge in speaking or writing English it is the most required language. Communication is necessary both in private life and in the world of work. Therefore, do not let anyone stop you from learning English and always try your best!

I think that bunning the use of mobile phones in public place is a trrible idea. It is nonsense to ban all of using mobile phones. Of course some functions of mobile phones in particular situations should be prohibited. Talking with mobile phone on public transport and in restaurants and theatres are good examples. But almost all functions that mobile phones have should not be prohibited. Because mobile phones have many functions not to be annoing people in public space. We can do many things with mobile phones silently. we can communicate with friends or business partners by using e-mail and enjoy watching SNS or movie cites like YOUTUBE. We also can study or work to connect on the internet. Today we pack many things in mobile phone. If you totally ban the use of mobile phones, you must ban reading a book, listening to music, writing something, ansering the cross puzzules and so on. This is that you are going to do. Banning the use of mobile phones in pabulic place gave us only negative infulences. It robs us of thinking about cases whether it is right to use mobile phones or not. Total banning the use of mobile phone is a kind of insult to us. If you think of us seriously and you treat us not ridiculous, please give us the chance which we think of using phones via saveral situations.

Having a healthy lifetsyle is nowadays important for everyone and though everyone knows how to accomplish that goal it is not happening that often. The problem is that school children or university students often do not do enough sports during the week. But still it would not be a solution to force them to do sports activities at least three times a week. Everyone should be able to decide on its own if he wants to do sport and how often. Of course school children often spend most of their time inside with their mobile phone or else, but not everyone of them. If you force those who are inactive to be active and do some sport it might happen that they hate it afterwards. They are taught about the necissety of health and sports often enough to decide on their own. A total of sports activities three times a week while having two different exams in one week leads to a lot of stress. It occurs often that young people want to be actice but simply do not have enough time for it because school and university can be so physically demanding. Of course going for run can be really relaxing because you can organize your thoughts. But when you have to think of analysis it can be really stressful as well. Especially if you are forced to do so. It basically produces a lot of pressure and you do not have as much fun as you could possibly have. Still sport is very important for everyone of us and therefore there would be other opportunities instead. For motivating young people in school or at university to become active you could introduce different kind of sports to them. One possible way would be to simply organize a trip to a climbing hall and show them how wonderful this sport could be.

I think it is acceptable to tell a lie. Of course I don't like a lie which makes for selfish reasons or helping only myself. But you need to tell a lie several specific stuations. For example the situation is that your grandfather or grandmother is in a hospital and his or her rest life is only a month. Do you need to say the truth in this situation? I want them to live vividly without any concerns instead of telling the truth. Of course his or her opinion should have a priolity. Another situation is that you and your classmates rtake on a bus to go to picnic. Then one girl feels bad and get carsick but it takes more than an hour to arrive at a distination. Then you should tell her that we will arrive soon and take it easy. If you think it is important to always tell the truth, it it very easy and simple to live. But I think that you throw away the chance of thinking about other people. If you take part in a sciety, you should treat others more preciously. Do you think that always telling the truth is not for everyone but for only yourself? I think that if you tell a lie for the people, it is more important than you always tell a truth.

Hi, Billal I write an email to tell you about how a trip was going on last weekend. I know that if you had not got sick, you would have come with us. Last week, we went to a beach instead of floating market. Yes, we changed a plan of one day trip because we had much time to stay at the beach for one night. In the morning, we walked along the beach and took many photos. That day was a windy and shiny. We played volleyball on the beach near the homestay in the afternoon. Then, we went to seafood market buying shimps, osters, and crabs to cook for dinner. Seafoods were very delicious and fresh. We were singing while Brian was playing the guitar. It was a good time of last school year. I hope you get well soon and join us next trip. Miss you, Por

My favorite subject is math. I never tired of it even though I have been studying it for ten hours every day. Racking my brain about math problems renders me pleasure. But I have some troubles. I can solve difficult problems if I have a lot of time, but the exam I'm going to take is time-limited one. This is because I want to reduce the amount of time I need to come up with the solution for problems. On top of that, I'd like to improve my arithmetic ability, which also reduces time loss. To achieve this, I will do a problem-solving exercise every week. In this exercise, I must solve six problems within 150 minutes, as I do in the exam. Then, I will analyze causes of loss of time, and consider feasible measures for them. And, I also make it a rule not to give up calculation in the middle.

--- Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? --- If I would answer this question, I would say, "Yes.." I have reasons to support this opinion. I know that traditional books, such as textbooks or workbooks are very good for both students and teacher' learning and teaching methods, but, recenly, there is a movement that support the use of technological textbooks or workbooks. (I will call them "e-textbooks or e-workbook" now.) I totally support this movement because by using "e-textbooks" or "e-workbooks," I believe that there will be a lot of benefits. For example, I believe that e-textbooks can help visualize some complicated things, such as chemical compounds or body mecanism, and e-workbooks will be able able to do answer checks automatically. Plus, by accepting this method, I believe that there will be less burden to both of students and teachers and they will be able to focus on some other things. I think it's full of benefits, not only to students, but also for teachers. For these reasons, I think there is a high possibility that school textbooks and workbooks will be replaced into technological ones.

My reasons for learning English Learning English is almost necessary nowadays. When you speak English, many things are opened to you, such as jobs, studies, or even friends ! For instance, I personally spend a lot of time surfing on the web, and during all of this time, I have sometimes met new people from all around the world. Having learned English the way I did permitted me to talk to those people and to discuss with them ! To be interested in new cultures, new ways of thinking and countries. Yet learning English is also important to me for my studies. I would love to be accepted in a prestigious High School with anglophone students. Maybe I'm too ambitious, but it's important to have dreams and to follow them ! Furthermore, I just love learning languages, especially English. I don't know why is it so special to me, but I don't always need a reason to do something, right ? Just go for it, and have fun !

The school of the future An excitement assumption: school of the future. There's something that always put me in questions. Why schools have the same profile since I was a child? They try to update the schedule, try to improve qualifications of teachers but the time are always the same. Today, parents, especially mothers need to work not only at house. So they need to leave their children in a safe place where they know their children will have many education activities. But the time that schools offer are rarely in accord with parents' timetable. If they supply this necessity, they are very expensive. So it's important to adapt schools' time. They should be flexible with hours. They will need to offer activities related to computer technologies. If they don't, students will be boring and not interested in classes. Some professions will be replaced by modern ones. So, schools will need offer courses to qualify workers to these new tendencies.

I partly agree to the opinion to live a long life. Because the possibilities to see something I can't imagine now and to watch the world cup soccer in Japan increase as I live a long life. Besides If I knew my life span 100 years, I could make various life plans. I think that It may be more useful to know my life span than to live a long life. But I mainly agree to the opinion to live a short but much more intence. There are two reasons. First I know who I am. I'm not a good man nor being deligent. If I have long-span life, I definitely become lazy and just live in vain. I have no confidense that I make my life fruitful. Second if I can live a long, nobody knows my healthy life span. If I will be at a hospital more than 50 years, it is the most painful thing for me. The life that it is short but intense is so cool. I think that a past great person's life is relatively short. Like them I want to live actively and accomplish something great. To be an honest I don't want to know my life span. In spite of the length of span I will be disappointed at everything and can't do any more. I manege to live my life because I don't know when I'm going to die.

Two months ago I went on a sightseeing holiday with my family, in Italy. That was the first time I had ever traveled abroad so I was very excited. It was mostly because I had to convince my parents that it was the perfect moment in our lives for such a holiday. The flight until there lasted only for about two hours although it felt like an eternety for me. Once there we went to the hotel to leave our luggage. Then we visited Vatican city. I had such a wonderful sensation walking through the galleries like I could see Michelangelo and Raphael working. The guide made us feel as we were a part of that extraordinary piece of art. We also saw the Colosseum, the Pantheon and La Fontana di Trevi and we couldn't avoid eating pizza and ice cream. Although I liked everything we saw, I felt a deep attraction for the Vatican's art galleries. The paintings looked so alive like I could transfer myself in that period only by staring at them. All together it was the best holiday I have ever had because, after all, I visited more than one place and learned a lot of things.

Hello. I think I have so many goals should be done at this school year. And one thing for sure, I achieved some foreign language courses but I never stop improving my level. Besides, I would also love to learn something else to enhance my journey for the path to creative career. The best point is that I would learn instruments, so that I can write my own songs and perform them on stage some day. An image of a little girl is playing the guitar so well has been built in my head recently. Though I'm not sure it's easy to learn but if I achieve it as well, that will be a woderful feeling I have ever experienced. Thus it motivates me to get it as soon as possible. I'm going to register a guitar course tomorrow thinking that would lead me to a new skill as a level of my life where I can cope with problems more creatively. Currently I don't know how to play at all, so I should write down for myself a process to tracking my learning speed, so that I can appreciate my progress. Hopefully the process should be got right as the way it is intended.

Usually, I am reluctant to do any exercise except for the dance. Because I don't really have fun when I do the sport. For instance, I have bought the new jogging shoes but I have only used them once for its purpose. The only exception is the street jazz. I have so much fun when I am dancing. Therefore, strictly speaking, the dance is not the exercise but the hobby for me. Furthermore, I would like to go for a walk with Max at the weekend regularly.

In my opinion, every student should have at least a few lessons of music. Of course, there are schools that prepare students for a career in the music business. Due to this, more lessons are needed. For "normal" schools tough I think that music should be a relaxing session to calm down and forget about the daily stress. I think that, music really helps to get into a good mood again. So everyone should have music courses in school. Music is not a subject you necessarily get a grade on, but it should be a group-building, free time activity. There should not be any restrictions, so that teachers can create individual experiences for every class. I am sure that music has a good influence on everyone's health and it could also help to prevent illnesses. Burn-out, for example , which is common among pupils, could be elliminated. Therefore, every school should offer some music courses!

Yes, I do. I like to exercise very much because I want my body stronger than before and I want to lose my weight. I exercise every day in the morning and evening. In the morning I have worked out for 30 minutes following a trainer on Youtube channel. I run for 30 minutes every day in the evening. Normally, I prefer exercising outside because I can breathe the natural air that is good for my health and better than air conditioning in gym. Actually, air conditioning is not good for health. The second reason, my house is far from the gym. I like running and swimming because I use every part of body to do these exercises and use less acceseries.

I think that studying abroad is the better choice that a student can take. Studying abroad, especially for the foreign languages students is the right opportunity to improve language and speak a lot. It's an opportunity to grow first, far from the family, but also to make friends with students all around the world. But there are also disadvantages about this type of opportunity, like the accommodation. In some cases, the accommodation for the abroad students are so far from the university and high schools and their must take a lot of buses for going to schools. An other problem is that, nowadays, the young people are so spoiled and so some of them, maybe can't do housework. Studying abroad it means that you must follow the schoollessons, do homework, do the washing machine, cook and thousand other things and not everyone, in my opinion is capable. So, studying abroad is an important opportunity, but if a student decide to take this opportunity, he have to roll up him sleeves.

I think that all students should have to study music. Why I think so is the following 2 reasons. First studying music can bring some good influences for other subjects. You know when we play the music, we use another part of the brain compared to studying maths, chemistory, biology and so on. Using the parts which you usually don't use, you can activate your brain and you may break through something. Second I think that all students should study as much subject as possible. Of course college students and students who decide to major in patucular subject may need not to study music. But for other students there are no reasons why it is good to regurate their subjects. To studying music they can feel their talents that they couldn't notice before. I think that it is important that we should offer whatever opportunities all students may have an interest. We should not cut their curiosity to study something. And all students may not like studying music. But it is necessary for them to experience things which they don't like. School is the place not only studying subjects but also getting experiences with your classmates. Students should experience various things for their future.

Of course there are many people who have no choice where to live because of financial reason. But if they can choose the place, I partly agree to the opinion that students move away and live on their own. There are two main reasons. First students can experience various things. They have to do all chores by themslves. They also must control themselves and judge evreything they are related. Whatever they experience are useful for the future. It is efficient to live on their own ealier so that they will leave their home soon or later. Second It save time that they live near university. I think that commuting time is one of the most meaningless. If they can save their time, they are pleased to live on their own. But I mainly agree to the opinion that students live at home with their family. Because the time that you live with your family is the most precious for your life. Besides this time is limited. When you want to be with them or you want to do something for them, they may not be there. Almost all the students will leave at home in the future. So they should be with their family as long as possible. Many things that you would experience if you live alone don't be needed for you in your college days. You should be with your family and you should make precious memories.

Zoos are one of the most interesting attractive for children but also for their parents. But there are a lot different opinions about zoos, many people believe that zoos are good places for children to learn about animalas and I completaly agree with them. It's an important place where kids can learn and discover such different and also uncommon animals. On the other and, many people believe animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. This is also an important point of view, is true that it is wrong to keep them in zoos, but lots animals that we see in zoos, are animals that were taken in difficult situations, where would not have survived in captivity. If, on one hand I agree with people that believe zoos are good place for learning about nature and animals, I completely disagree with circuses, where animals are forced to perform funny scenes to amuse spectators.

Nowadays video games are an important part of children. If, on one hand some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, and I agree with this feeling, on the other hand there are others that believe that video games may have some positive effects. Is a complex question. Is true that video games may have some positive effects, such improve skills but I'm completely sure that, new video games can have big negative impact on children. Now, there are a lot of war video games, where children must kill each other for win, and this, in my opinion is sadly. Educated video games are not attractive for children, then prefer violent video games. In the end, parents of young children must try to tell their children that video games can be dangerous and also they must try to avoid children playing for many hours.

When I am too busy, I also go for a walk for about 15 minutes in the evening. I prefer outside activities. Going outside is more interesting. I can exercise and be relaxed at the same time. When I walk outdoor, I can breathe fresh air, enjoy the atmosphere and watch daily activities of people. Going to a gym is not very comfortable for me. Many people gather at the same place. Sometimes, it is very noisy at the gym. People who go to a gym could not enjoy as many things as going outside. I like outdoor walk. As I mentioned, when walking outside, I can enjoy many things at the same time. Walking is actually very beneficial for your health both physically and mentally.

MODERN SCHOOLS The older we are getting, the more technological progess we can see. We create flying cars in our heads thinking about the future. But how about schools? What will they look like next hundred years? When you turn back a hundred years, you see how many changes became from that time. We already learn from different devices in school. The teachers show information not only on blackboards, but also electric boards, on which they can freely turn next topics. So what's next? It is believed that in the future robots will replace humans work. So this is how I see it... Teachers will be replaced by robots, but they still will look like real human beings. I also think that in future students will have to give their fingerprint to prevent burglaries. We are also may have special applications with our school achievements. But I suppose sitting in the wooden chairs in front of a desk will never change, because it is the only way teaching can be made. I also think the school canteens will still operate giving delicious dinners to the students.

Dear workers in the town council, I’m writing to you regarding the issue with the use of portable devices such a mobile phone in the public spaces. Recent researches indicate that the number of users in the last years is rapidly increased and the mobile phones became integral part of us. On the one hand, during the usage from mobile phones in the public places the citizens are showing an unrespect for their companion and other individuals. This conduct leads the population to become introvert. On the other hand, for many people the mobile phones are a necessarily due to a work or a private matter. For our ancestors was unimaginable to have a piece of cutting age technology in their pocket, but for us, the descendants means that sometimes the usage of cell phone in a restaurant is unavoidable. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a need for taking measures regarding this matter. The burden of responsibility lies in the hand of any of us. As regards the most appropriate response to this situation, one suggestion would be to start a campaign to show the nation the disadvantages of overusing their mobile phones on public places. In my opinion it would be wrong to take the law into your own hands and completely prohibit using cell phones. It would be great put all factors in perspective before concluding. The world surely be a better place to live if we all have respect for each other. After all, we are only humans but have all the time in our hands to think over and create a better tomorrow for our successors.

Dear Mark, As I mentioned in my previous letter, at last, I convinced my father to go to cinemas with me to watch my favourite movie "the matrix." I watch the matrix for six times so far. Each time I watch it, I find some new information. I like this movie because it gives me a sense of why we are here in this world as humans, and it makes me appreciate the beauties of my life. Especially the character of neo is fantastic: the way he is presented and how he fits into the story. I believe if you give a chance to the matrix, you would love it as well.

There is no better choice . I think it all depends what type of person you are . Some people they like to be independent and they are mature enough to live alone . Being alone gives them more space and they learn more about life and themselves . Some people may need extra support and attention from their parents or family . This is up to personal circumstances. I think is nice to have a free head , free from worried about food or washing . This is helpful if you study a lot . But from another point of view I believe is great to be an independent person . This is the same important equal with education. Which one is better? Live on their own while you attend university or live at home with the family . If you have a nice and helpful family I would say " why not " ?

Greetings, I would like to state that I support this policy personally. Nowadays, even though the appearance of the mobile phones do really have a huge positive impact on our everyday life in aspect of convenience, we unfortunately have a few more issues due to the over-reliance to mobile phones. That is, the reasons that banning the phone in public areas will help people to live on a healthy life. First of all, people will achknowledge the risk of not paying enough attention to their surroundings. For example, Last week's accident in a coffee shop near my apartment was because the victim's attention had been drawn from his mobile phone. Which makes them unable to react when it is still not too late to do so. Therefore, if we decide to forbid mobile phones in public areas, it will save a lot of people from scalds when they can notice it early. Second, it is not hard to find out that a lot of people tend to have humpbacked poses while using their phone, it may be common to everyone. Nevertheless, the potential risk it may cause to our spine is definitely one thing no one ever wants to run in. If people don't correct their stance while using a phone or just prevent themselves from using it too much, it is reasonable to have such a strict policy to protect our citizens. As a result, restricting people from using phone might be inconvenient, but it still a good idea for public health in the long run.

People always have been told that honesty is one of the most important virtues since they were little, which means they should always avoid lying to others. Even though no specific reasons were given at that time, teachers prefer to tell children moral stories. People think of their childhood while reviewing old photo albums, these memories might be reminiscent of the importance of being honest, as their teacher once told them. People will have to face several consequences if they are found being deceitful. There is a really simple fact about lying to others, and they will choose not listening to you next time. It can be troublesome when you need help in the future. What's worse, if there are fraudulent criminals disguised their conspiracies as charity all over the place, it would have a devastating impact on people's faith about giving a hand to those in needs in the long run. When it is becoming harder and harder for them to receive any help, it could one of most despair thing can happen to our society. Also, bragging yourself, as a form of lying, always makes your feelings hollow eventually. Not to mention trying to cover up these lies with other lies, and it will end up out of hand. Last but not least, lying will make you blind to where you can improve to be a better person. Not knowing their shortcomings, some people create a false impression of themselves by lying to others.

Recent research indicates that the lifespan increases through the last decades. Even if we live a way more dynamic life than our ancestors, through all the mod cons a huge development in medicine has been made. What impact, if any, have these developments had on the general public’s opinion? There is no doubt that most of the population would want to live a long intensive life. However, it is an act of God how long we can stay on the earth. Anyway, we can decide if our remaining years will be intensive or not. Let’s consider two situations. Firstly, if we could have a relatively long life indulged with plenty of leisure time. We should change our tune towards be less career oriented and abandon ourselves more pastime. It doesn’t mean to be couch potatoes, rather spoiling ourselves with more time for socializing and bring our friends and acquaintances together. Secondly, if we consider shorter life fulfilled with intension. In my opinion, finding the right work-life balance is the masterwork. Our lifestyle needs to be so aligned that we can compromise having a successful career with taking time in our hands to hang out with family, spouse and friends. The world surely be a better place to live in if anybody have a life fulfilled with enjoyment and happiness. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel, we just sometimes need to live on the spur of the moment.

I am very satisfied with my marks in English and philosophy, as I have got an A+ in both the subjects. However, I think there is still space of improvement in the latter, as I do not quite feel comfortable in that subject. I often perceive that I just do not understand the context of the philosphers' theories, for instance. One of my worst subjects is music, yet unfortunately it is, besides German, my advanced course. I am not bad in it, though, at least it is still an A, even though with an appendaged minus. But I must have high expectations, due to the difficulties you can come across with getting a rare place at university. But how to improve in music? I could ask my music teacher if I do not understand her explanations. It is also always helpful to become more devoted in the lessons, as the written examinations only count a third. Just raising your hand more frequently can work wonders, I guess.

In 2017 we spent a fortnight in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was an important experience for me, because I had just started being interested in the English language and culture. We did a lot of standard tourist programmes, including two bus trips through the Highlands. Even though I normally despise mountains, I could not help being fascinated by the magnificent Scottish mountains and their light green tinge. Furthermore we visited the famous Edinburgh Castle, which lies exactly in the center of the city. We even hiked in the bosom of Edinburgh, as there is a vast stretch of land containing large rocks only a few bus stops further on. And believe it or not: There was access to the North sea as well! Sea, mountains, and a capital city, all in one! Moreover that holiday gave me a first hand experience of how multifaceted the English language with all its different accents is. Even being a complete layman in that language back then, I could notice that the Scottish people spoke differently from what I had so far heard. All in all, that stay was one of my best holidays I ever had, maybe even the best of all.

Nowadays, it is a fact that the vast majority of children like to spend their time playing video games. I think that is a good way of entertaining but only if it is done with control. Firstly, it is understandable that parents do not like video games, because it can bring about several problems for their kids, for example, it can make them more violent, antisocial, addicted.... On the other hand, I believe that this hobby can help young people because it can bring some benefits too, such as improving their creativity, developing their imagination, helping them to make friends... A further point is that the most important facts when deciding if video games are good or bad, are how much time you use them and what type of video game you are playing. In conclusion, from my point of view, video games are not such a negative thing like most of parents think, but it all depends on how much control you have when you are playing them.

In my opinion, animals belong in nature, but I am not against zoos. Please don't confuse my words. I think zoos are important. Zoos allow people to learn about animals, their environment and what they eat. Furthermore, the zoos are a family's spaces where children could enjoy the nature without the wild life risk. Also, the most important zoos in the world have helped to preserve some animals species which are disappearing. For example, many animals in danger of extinction have reproduced in zoos. On the other hand I don't agree with people who have wild animals locked in cages. In my country, there are many people who have exotic birds in cages. Other people have squirrels and turtles as a pet. I think this is animal cruelty. The ordinary people don't know about wild animals health care. Also, the people don't supply suitable food to their animals. This animals can't reproduce in captivity because they don't have a couple.

Nowadays in almost all cities around the world we can find a zoo, but in my opinion, these are places where most of animals suffer and we should close most of them. Firstly, people think that zoos are places where kids will have a very enjoyable time because they can see exotic animals, but they do not think about how stressed and scared this will make them feel. On the other hand, the fact of beeng able to see such as wonderful animals so close to us, is an awesome experience, because you can realise how astonishing the nature is. A further point is that animals in zoos are locked in usually not very ample spaces, and these animals, as wild animals, must be free in their own habitat. Moreover, they do not receive the best feed and that is why most of them die. In conclusion, from my point of view, I believe that zoos must be closed because although we can see a lot of incredible animal species, while we enjoy it, they suffer and we should let them live free.

A greater incorporation of electronics is compulsory to happen, as it will offer you a new scope of possibilities. You will be able to attend school in spite of a slight cold, as online teaching will be an inevitable change of education. But the consequence is a rising lack of social qualities on the sides of the students. Instead of communicating by sitting beside each other, their only way of talking to each other in their online-school takes place through text messages. Everyone is aware of the negative result originating from that. Being isolated in your room, staring on the screen several hours in one go, runs counter with active and often company-searching children. Furthermore the lacking opportunities of sport lessons would aggravate the problem of lassitude, as physical exertion would get constantly less important. Many students would soon need glasses, too. To conclude, I regard the physical school we are still used to nowadays as substantial for the child's education.

I'm not sure that whether I can call it is a holiday or not. It isn't an absolutely holiday, but in that period of time, I and my friends spent much more time together and had so many activities such as learning our major subject at one of the best schools in Vietnam, getting around Ho Chi Minh city, join some club at BK Dorm and meeting many new friends . So I will talk about it. My most favourite holiday was in the summer in 2019. I was in a school Physics team. In this team, we learn too much about Physics, it's really hard, to join Physics competitions and get awards. And we got a support from my school, they provided money for us to learn in High School for Gifted in Ho Chi Minh City. Of course, we moved to Sai Gon in that summer. In that time, we learn Physics with an excellence teacher, his name is Pham Hoang, and his class on the morning. It is the worst mornings in my life. He taught the things that I can't absolutely understand anything. But after that, everything with me was like heaven. I had all time in the afternoon and evening to do anything I like. Usually, we would have lunch after learning time and go back to BK Dorm, took a nap to 3 p.m.. And then, sometime we went to the mall together, somtime just stayed in our own room, played guitar, sang and told stories. And until 5p.m., I went to sport room and played table tennis with students in BKU. I met some new friends, they all were really kind and friendly. And it was my best holiday.

When I was a child, the video games were launching. It was very exciting and it was considered an encourage for neuromuscular and cerebral exercises. But they became very popular and sometimes take so much time of young people that they became a concern not only for parents but educational professionals and public health. Some of those young people are so involved with video games that they forget their responsibilities like studying and working. If they are not used so much but only for lesuire, enjoying time with friends they are healthful. But the problem is that this line is so sutil. Beyond these problems, they increase the risk of obesity and it's consequence. In my humble opinion, I think parents could establish some limits for their children, like as time for enjoying video games but time for their studying; they would also encourage physical activities or playing physical games.

In general, most of the students meet many different teachers throughout their student life, which I think it´s great because it helps them a lot. Firstly, dealing with various teachers will help students because they will learn different methods of studying, like for example, in mathematics. On the other hand, having the same professors during many years, can benefit pupils because they get used to the form of teaching, to the exams design.... And also, they build up a better relationship between them. Another point is that, meeting several teachers during their life, will help young people to know and get used to numerous personalities and cultures and that is such an important thing to keep in mind. In conclusion, I believe that it is really important for students to have new teachers each year, because they can learn so many styles of studying and they face up to different ways of thinking, distinct cultures and that is as significant as the other subjects.

In this day and age, most of the time young people feel that the educational system is not suited for them. Some students can learn things very easily and find that they are not using their abilities to its fullest or the other way round. This second group of students cannot have good grades regardless of how much they study, as they do not have the capacity to make the most of it. If a school is considering these possibilities when giving the title of graduation to their students, they ought to be aware of the opportunities in the surroundings to better facilitate the connection between both sides. Youngsters sometimes have low self-esteem which makes it difficult for them to decide what to do, fearing the approach they have with others. As far as adults areconcerned, they should stymulate criativity, giving younsters tools to develop their integration, and at last but not least, to help and motivate them to demonstrate their points of view. Clearly, this type of work will help young people not only to engage in society but also to develop their mindset. When learning by doing, people create intergenerational bonds, which are beneficial to get everyone closer to each other. Lest we forget that here is always the opportunity to find solutions for problems when there is solidarity. Bearing all this in mind, volunteering could create a space for alternative means of community support, it could also help the economic system and raise humanitarian values as there is no technical obligation. It would only require people to respect one another.

Firstly, I would like to discuss on the point of Psychology. if people live long time together than they can understand their body langauge very well and their way of presentation or teaching. Grasping study material is not so easy if students is unable to understand the teacher personality and it takes time to build up between student and teacher. if the same teacher for a long time then he could understand the that which subject or speciffic point to be focused more.

It's an interesting question. We have the same family, parents for the whole life. And it's important to build relationship based on respecting and loving each other. Regarding teacher it could be like that. But the question is that in our life we will have to relate with many kinds of people and their different personalities. So we need to have experiences with many different people, in our childhood, for strenghening our knowledge about relationships. Doing that, we would learn to respect other opinions, understand their feelings, their cultures and why are so. Having different teachers in our life will contribute with having contact with different techniques, behaviours, speakings. Another special point is the empathy. So if you don't like someone you don't need to be with this same person each year. In my opinion, I think we have the right to know different people, so it's important to have different teacher each year.

There are 2 main reasons why few doctors in rural areas. First the number of the whole doctors is not enough. If the problem is its imblance, there should be many doctors who don't earn much money in cities. Seeing from doctors it is natural that they live and work at convenience places unless they have special reasons to go to rural areas. Next rural areas don't have saveral support systems that doctors can keep working there. I think a good business is made from a good relationship. Once I heard the following news. A doctor go to a rural area to work there. This village has only 500 people. The locals envy a doctor and they ignore him. After all they couldn't communicate well and a doctor came to get a mental disease. The medical system collapsed. To solve this problem a cooperation with a gavernment and a doctor assosiation is needed. Of course we should increase the number of doctors, but it is meaningless if the quality fall. And it is similarly important to spread the range of co-medical worker's job. It is quite important to do well as a team. It leads to more efficiental work. Considering the speciality of doctors government should assign doctors to specific areas. To have 'public' doctors may improve this situation.

I think that the students benefit more from having new teachers every year, because students should be able to socialize with different kind of teachers to improve their social skills. They need to learn different ways to solve problems, or to learn from another point of view from their different teacher's. They also need to need to learn how to manage themselves with different kinds of teacher's. The students also should be able to learn to work different ways with different kind of teacher's, and they should be able to experience different kinds of teacher's, works, learnings, problem solving and a lot of things more.

I agree with the opinion that high schools impose on students for attending a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Because students can grow up through volunteer work experience. Of course I know some objections that it is far away from its essence to make students take part in volunteer work as a requirement of graduation. It is the best to do it from his spontaneous volunteer spirit. But why schools dare to do so is that they have ceatain thoughts that volunteer work is definitely good for students' life. When I was in high school, I took part in volunteer work as a kindergarten teacher. It was really fun to play with kids. But I felt a kind of defficulties. And I thought that it was quite tough that smiling all the day as a professional. Generally the salary of kindergarten teacher is not high. I really felt their professional spirits and their job ethic. To experience the outside of your world through volunteer work you can realize how small your place which usually live in is. The discovery is the most precious for you. There is a saying in Japan; No matter how much you may spend money, you should experience various defficulties or trouble . A experience is a treasure. I think it is good for students that schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Because it may be a trigger to realize something.

In the contemporary society, volunteer certificate is considered as a compulsory requirement for students to graduate in some high school, which remains a highly continuous public discourse. I strongly believe that although many benefits that this trend has brought to students, its drawbacks should not be ignored. On the one hand, volunteer work plays an essential role in helping youngster not only develop their social relationship but also become more active and sympathy. Nowadays, adolescent live in a close- knit family with high standard of living, so some of them might not understand how difficult the poor have to experience. Becoming a volunteer will get youngster out of their comfort vibe because they have a chance to do something that they have never done before to help the elderly, the disabled,... such as collecting old stuff, raising fund, teaching disabled children at orphanage,... Thanks to these activities, students can broaden their mind and know how to get well on with other people, no matter where they are from. Moreover, teenagers also become more empathy to their parents and appreciate the time all members live together. The Green Summer is a good illustration for volunteer work in Viet Nam, which attracts millions of students every year with many unforgettable experience. On the other hand, those whose argument revolves around the disadvantages of obligatory volunteer certificate might contend that students can only receive real value when they participate in volunteering without be required. It is undeniable that some volunteers feel exhausted after doing volunteer work and they just think about graduate certificate, in lieu of precious value from volunteering thereby not able to focusing on helping communities. As the result, helping communities to get ovet the obstacles in life indeliberately become a tedious task for youngster, instead of a useful work for developing both knowledge and positive personality. In conclusion, the rise of compulsory volunteer has both advantages and disadvantages. From a personal perspective, the aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for me to believe that the downsides of this trend outweighs its upsides and more encouragement should be made by school and society to interest students in volunteer work.

I think it is good that the children play video games, because with certain types of video games the children may get some skills by playing video games, like they may be faster at reacting if something doesn't seems right, or lots of other things. But if children play video games that are not appropriate for their age, or that some of the video games that the children play, contain violence thst the children are not supposed to watch. Also there are some types of video games that challenge the children minds, by asking them challinging questions, or giving them a mystery to solve, and what they would do if they're in some type of tricky situation. If there is a video game, with all the characteristics that I mentioned, but the video game's age is not appropriate for your child it is best that you don't buy it. That is my opinion.

At this time of inequality world, a big round of applause must be given to front-line volunters who have been battling poverty and the health issues for underprivileged people. We are in desperate need for more volunteers in order to continue the flight and win this poverty war. Forcing high schools to complete the volunteer work might increase the number of volunteers in the short run, however, it is not sustainable in the long run. This requirement can impose students to take the positive action for their community, but it can't highlight their concern over the struggling of the underpriviledge in their community to cope with the worsen the air pollution, drought and hungry. Forcing students without educating them about volunteer work can mark a new point of conflict. They will solve the problem without emphasize the beneficial living condition. I suggest the school to initiate the volunteer course. This course will make the students believed and interested in the volunteers work story given out by the guest teachers who has adopted the volunteer work in their routine life. This course will mention about possible way to start easily volunteer work. If the students are educated, it will be easy for convincing them to take the small steps in action. To make the volunteer work contagious, the school need a wisely communicated campaign and intriguing reward. The school might offer the certificated for those who have finished this volunteer course. This purpose of this course is to mitigate the damage from misunderstanding action. Enlighting the value of volunteers work instead of imposing school requirement seem to be an effective and sustainable approach to ensure that every student access to a set of knowledge before taking the meaningful work for others.

The trend of globalization increase every day. It's an important dominant if you know foreign language as much as possible. It reveal that the ability to speaking foreign language is one of the main element to be development and succeed on social nowadays. But in the past, learning to speak a foreign language is not as important as these days. Comerce just happened in a small area and they spoke the same language. Learning foreign language was not popular anf there were not many foreign language teachers so if you wanted to learn a new language, it was vitally hard and expensive. People didn't have any demand to sell with foreigners or travel in another country so they didn't have any reason to learn a new language. Just only when world war happened. European countries like England, French, Germany, Italy and some other countries like American and Japan were strengthen colonial aggression, leaning foreign language is just started to get focused.

Obviously, to perform optimally, an office should provide a quiet and calm workspace, so that the employees can focuss on their jobs and they won't be distracted during worktime. Therefore, closed workstations or cubicles seem like the perfect solution to optimise the employees' perfomances. On the other hand, how long can you really stay focussed on your own in a boring room? Employees in enclosed workstations often catch themselves staring at a blank wall, while people in open floorplan designed offices are more motivated to work. The reason for this is that seeing other people work is very motivating and increases your own productivity. Despite the fact that there is more noise and employees can easily get distracted because of smalltalk and chats with co-workers, they will probably work harder than they would in an enclosed workspace. In addition to this, it is easier for the boss or manager to check in on his employees in an open office, since they can just walk through the workspace. The employees will feel more pressure to continue to work when they know they are being watched, whereas the temptation to play a game on your computer in the enclosed workspace, since no one notices anyway, much bigger. To summarize, an enclosed workspace might seem to improve the employees productivity at first sight, but in my opinion, an open office is more effective. A little chat once in a while is not that bad, as long as employees are inspired and motivated most of the time.

Hi Teacher!, so far, I have liked Write and Improve, it has really helped me with my wrtings to be better, I have learnt some new vocabulary. I now know how to use certain words for certain things to say, I know how to write some words that I had a problem memoraising, I know how to use the dots, the comas, the colon, and a bunch of other punctuation marks. what I didn't like about Write and Improve was that, I have to write to many words, and I don't know what to write more about!, sometimes I don't understand why the program says that some of the words are wrong, but I search them and their right, and sometimes write about what I am supposed to write and says that I should have written about what it told em to write.

How employees feel at work is becoming a main focus nowadays. Managers admitted that workers are more effective when they feel comfortable at work, and for the last recent years have wondered how to make it happen. In order to make workers comfortable, a lot have ideas has seen the light. New work organisations appeared as: homeworking, new openspaces, relax rooms, and many more. In my opinion all of these arragement are an excellent thing. The new open spaces, one of the best ideas of these new organisations. First, openspaces brought to cowokers the chance to communicate much more. They are now able to exchange information much more easily than before. In cubicles people had to phone their coworkes or go to their desk in order to give an information. Also, open spaces is a good way to reenforce the team building, and to create a team spirit even stronger. When people are in enclosed workstations, they easy can forget they are a teamp. With open spaces relationship between co-workers are stronger. Of course, openspaces can offer some difficulties towards some employees. Some people find it too noisy and are having trouble to concatrate on their work. Other people will regret their intimacy, and might feel uncomfortable in a space with no walls. For the first difficulty, employees can use headphones to reduce the noise, and not be disturb for a time period. For the second difficulty, it's up to every employee to decorate their desk with photos, or souvenirs to make it more intimate. Regarding this different points, I believe open spaces are a great new way to organize the work place and should be encourage.

I think that the advantages to study in another country are: that you get to visit other countries, you can learn new traditions or cultures, you get to learn other languages apart from the ones you already know, you can learn in different ways than the ones you learnt in your own country. You can make new friends and visit lots of the touristic places in the country your visiting. The disanvanteges of studying abroad are: to go to study to another country is expensive, you are going to leave your friends and family, you have to buy hotel tickets, get a scholarship, or stay with a host family in the ciuntry you want to study in, you need to be responsible while you are staying with your host family, you need to behave with your host family. That is my opinion of the advantages, and disanvanteges to study abroad.

Nowadys more and more people learn foreign leanguage. They need it for better job and trevelling abroad. In my opinion, it is very important to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past. Firstly, we need language to communicate to eatch other. Knowledge of grammar rules improve this skills. What's more, in the past knowing foreging language help to survive during the war. If you had known language of your opponnet, you would have rescue your family. Secondly, in the past, somebody who know foreign language very well, could earn a good salry. Because lack of books and money not many people was able to learn speak foreign language. As a result, they can find better job than ordinary people. These days we can observe similar sitation. Many employers looking for people who can speak forgin language fluently. Lastly, all the time people who know foreign language very well are better traveler than poeople who know only their mother tongue. T To sum up, learning speaking skills was and it is the main reason why people learn new language. They want to communicate.

As per my opinion I don't think students need to do some specific work because then it will be unfair for the students who have got less work, if you really want to do this type of work the same work with the same topics given to everychild. To graduate you do need to do some work and this could be one of the ideas which could be chosen for the school. Overall I would nether say yes or no for this statement because there can be advantages and disadvantages on both the sides. I could also say yes to this statement because you need to do some hard work to get something you can't just sit there with no work done and say I graduated so you do need to do some volunteer work in order to graduate and achieve what you want. You can choose any one of the options for the school authority.

Yes I highly agre with the statement becasue physical and other activities are equally important as studies. They are very important because only studies can make the students brain a bit annoying, and if someone is highly educated he should have some other qualities which can impress people. Musical training helps develop language and reasoning. Students who have early musical training will develop the areas of the brain related to language and reasoning. The left side of the brain is better developed with music, and songs can help imprint information on young minds. It help brain more creative ideas as the person becomes a professional player in playing music. This can make the brain development better for the peroson and it work even faster this means that it will make him intelligent in all ways. If the students are only taught only one thing there brain can be damaged by having so much information about only one thing.

Nowadays, a lot of students choose to study abroad in countries with another language and culture, which I think is a great educative and unforgettable experience to live. Firstly, studying in another country for a year or even some months, will benefit students by giving them a great deal of knowledge and experience of a language and the traditions of its country, because while they are learning and studying at the high school or university, they are also discovering the way of thinking and living in a completely different country. On the other hand, being and exchange student can be not as exciting as it seems. For example, if a student is too shy , he can find adapting to a new country a very harsh experience. Also, they can feel homesick, which can be harmful for their school course. A further point is that the fact of travelling alone and at first find yourself alone in a place you have never been in, its as well a maximum change for the young boys to become more independent, learn how to look after themselves and also they make and meet new friends.7 In conclusion, despite some disadvantages that making an exchange year in another country might bring, I believe that if someone has the opportunity, he must take it, because I bet it will be an astonishing year which in addition to make you learn a lot, will change completely your life.

Nowadays, people who live in the affluent countries are getting older . Therefore the demand to the medical access is increasing swiftly. However there are a less medical doctors in the rural areas compared with cities. There are varius reasons that a medical doctor prefers to work in a city than a rural area accoridng different reaserchs that is executed by different European medical hospitals. First of all, a research that is conducted by Erasmuc MC in the Netherlands shows that the medical doctors prefer to work in cities because of the family. Both their spouses as their children are against live in a small city. Moreover, it turns out that the partner of the medical doctor a work has that is settled in a city. Secondly, there are problems associated with transport. The roads in a lot of wealthy countries is getting bussier, so the traffic jam is increasing rapidly in those countries. This problem daunted the medical doctors to work in rural areas. Many medical doctors show that they are willing to work in a rural areas, however they avoid ttese areas due to the traffic jams. On the other hand, the research indicate that there are medical doctors who avoid work in a rural areas because the care demand in a rural area is lower than the demand in a city. In a big cities there a lot of people , therefore there are a lot of people who visit the medical doctor. To summarize a medical doctor would earn more money if he or she works in a city than a rural area. To solve this problem the government has to encourage the use of public transport. If the people who work for other sectors use more in public transport instead of cars, the traffic jam would decrease. This will make it easier for the medical doctors to travel from a city to a rural areas. Another solutation would be that the health insurance companies paid more to those work in a rural areas to encourage the medical doctors to work in a rural area.

INTRODUCTION Telling the truth has been an issue always argued for centuries, and all men have always wandered the importance of it. Poets, phylosophers, musicians and more generally every kind of artists have posed the question. However, I think that neither themselves nor their audience can give en exhausted answer. WHAT IS THAT? In accordance with some of the most prestigiuos phylosophical theories, we cannot find a precise statement to sum up what truth is , in other words they argue that truth does not exist. To be more precise they assume that there is not only a single truth, but thousands or billiards examples of it. Everyone of us knows what is real for him and the underlying reasons that lead him to believe in something. EXAMPLES As I see it, not always telling the truth is the best thing to do, in same cases a lies is a way to protect people especially our dearest and nearest. On the other hand, every one of us should be intuitive enough to know when is the moment to lie or telling the truth, and above all recognising who is ready to accept a difficult and harmful truth even when it could convey a big sorrow. Some examples can be related to relationships or diseases where your doubts do not let you to decide what is better for others. CONCLUSIONS As I said before, we are required a large quantity of braveness, but also a sharp spirit of observation to decide when is the moment to speak clearly.

You will not believe that one of the most important holiday I have ever had was the one when my sister got married and I was the bridesmaid. It was in Thailand and believe or not, there is nothing in the world like this wedding. For a start, the organisation was well-planned. Every detail was perfectly neat, such as the choice of flowers and meals. I must also mention that there was an orchestra for the reception. The music were chosen by the maid and it was full of emotion, particularly for my parents. Apart from that, the theme of the wedding was about Thailand, therefore every guests were wearing traditional uniform and it was proudful.

There have been a lot of proven studies that an open space office is better than enclosed workstations or cubicles. Fruther more there have also been articles about the advantages and disadvantages regarding open space offices. First of all, I would like to write briefly about enclosed workstations or basically offices with a lot of walls to separate the employees from each other. A cubicle is mostly a small and quite dark room. If the employee is standing, he might see over the walls. As soon as the employee is sitting at his desk he will not see over the top of the cubicle wall. You might feel a bit claustrophobic. In worst case, there will be no welcoming and bright sunlight around you. Besides dark walls and the feeling of being in a cage like an animal, people may also get easily distracted. No one would notice, if you are on your phone playing games or buying clothes online. This provides us the conclusion that an open space office is the better solution for the employees and the whole company. Beginning with the sunlight around everybody and no dark walls around you and your co-workers. People can be more productive, if they see how hard their co-workers are working. It is true that you will have more noises around you, because of the other people. But there are a lot of solutions to provide a quiet surroundings. People can listen to music or attach little walls around their desks. These walls help to minimalise the nosies around you but do not cover the whole view of the person sitting at the desk. The final reason is the socialising with the co-workers. All employees will have a strong bond, if there are no dark walls surrounding them.

Here in Italy we go to school for thirteen years, so we have the chance to meet a lot of different teachers. I don't think students can benefit from having new teachers every year, but neither from having the same for all their school life. The best choice is always the one in the middle: having the same teachers for a limited period. Having new teachers every year would mean changing method too often and there would be no continuity with the work done the previous year. Moreover students and teachers wouldn't be able to build a lasting and solid connection. On the other hand, keeping same teachers for all school years could become a limit factor. Different people can offer different methods and perspectives. Remaining together for ten years could mean creating a connection which goes beyond the limits of a student-teacher connection. The best option is staying together for several years, in this way students and teachers learn to know each other and to cohoperate together, and completing a school program becomes easier.

They make available and spread knowledge by writings, speakings and videos. We can even study and work on computers. Computers have more potential than our brains so using it is amazing but worrying.

There have been an ongoing debate around enclosed workstations versus open design. Open offices tend to enable collaboration while enclosed spaces tend to encourage more focus. However, every spaces have been designing for specific purpose like our house where living room is an open space for familiy gathering while our bedroom is an enclosed space for private activity. Office should be designed in the same direction. Employees have been doing many activities in the office. Clearly not all of these activities are effectively done in a single type of a space. This is the main reason I support the company to make a multipurpose working spaces. Meeting and training might need open space for enhancing collaboration and discussion. On the other hand, cubicles will be a peaceful space for doing a complicated work which need deeply focus. Diversifying the environment of working space will give the employees the choice to choose the space for completing their specific task in productive way. Well design working space can increase creativity, innovation and proficiency in the company. In my opinion, I would suggest combining the cubicles and open spaces because every employee has their own preference. Let's them choose their working environment for delivering highly productive task. Many innovative offices make a radical change by offering their employee with non-fixed seat. Employees can freely choose to work at quiet room, garden, kitchen, co-working space or any spaces that they feel comfortable to work. Unbelievable, the variety working space can provoke employees' productivity when the office was designed based on collective of data.

Schooling is a big part of someone's life. There you meet a lot of people: teachers, friends, supervisers and more. Some will come into your life and will never leave, while others will follow their own path. In this journey, some people will have the same teacher for several year while other will have new teachers each year. In my opinion having different teachers each year is the best way to collect new skills, and to learn from different places. Everyone is unique, and every teachers also are. Having a new teacher each year will give you new skills, and will help you to develop yourself in different manners. Also having a new teacher each year is the best way to confront students with real life. When you will go to work, you will meet a lot of different people, and different attitudes. Meeting authorities figure changing when you are studying is a very good way to prevent the futre. Another main point is: adaptation. Changing teachers will help young ones to be adaptative in different situations. I might be 100% sure it is better for students, I also understand the disadvantages of changing teachers each year. First, some children need time to get used to someone. And for this kind of people changing each year is very challenging. They might even suffer from this turn-over, and see it as if they were abandoned by their teachers. Also, for students that have been developing a trustworthy relationship with their teachers they could be more motivated within their work if they have the same teacher each year. Anyway, there are a lot of sensibilities, and my opinion is not a sure thing, even if I believe in my reasons.

We live in an age when most of us have a bad lifestyle. Not because we do not exercise, but it is because we eat a lot of junk foods. Which involved a bad health condition. There are some reasons that I can explain this statement. First, people can do exercises inside their own house without going out whenever we want. Even though, sometime we are poorly equipped. For instance, you have to drive or walk to the gym to do some exercises, which means you still have to go out. Secondly, exercising outside or our house can have it benefits, such as taking some fresh air. But on the other hand, you cannot do it at all the time, for example in the case of bad weather. Therefore, indoor workout is not that bad. Another thing to consider is eating healthy food can keeps us fit withour doing any exercises. However, healthy food can cost a lot.

What the stratigies he used and exercise and methods to navigates ths benefits of the course. In addition how he makes assessment for the students to make sure they are understand the lessons. The second, 40 percent walks around the teacher. the charisma, the technics he provides attracts the attention of the students. In my opinion it is not about the years the teacher teaches them or having a new teacher in each year. Many students tend to a good teacher reputation. Also. the views from his learners, are they satisfied regard to his teaching or frustrated because of him, the scores the students got when he taught them. obviously it is more than the teacher it is learning organziation, teaching procedures and skilled teacher in the end of the circle.

My favourite season of the year is summer. Summer is special for me because I was born this season and my family to. I love summer because of the warm weather, the school vacation, and the endless fun. I really enjoy the warm weather because it’s the perfect atmosphere to do outdoor activities. My favorite part about summer has to be the fact that school is closed for two months. During summer, you’re free to do whatever you want, not worrying about curfew or waking up early for school. Summer time is a great time to relax with friends and family by soaking up the sun at a beach or simply having dinner together. Also, another fact why I like summer it's because I'm a tennis player and the season starts during summer so I can go to tournaments, meet new people and play tennis with them. This is my favourite part of the year, what's yours?

I think animals belong to nature. The idea of forcing to live animals outside their natural environment is not good to me. If we want to learn about them we could prepare and adapt natural places. We could enjoy a safari too. There are different things we could to do to enjoy and learn about them. I firmly believe those animals suffer in captivity. Why make them suffer? The answer based on the learning experience don´t like to me. At the end, these zoos are businesses. Should we commerce with these animals feelings? I don´t think so. I think we could do it better as a society and we should respect their place in the world. Our children and scientists would agree with a different way to manage this situation for sure. Please, let them to enjoy and live free in their environment, this is the only way we can grow as a society.

Learning can be difficult if we don't use appropriate tools. For example, learning English with many tools at the same time will make learners confused. Different tools have different unique features. This text is a suggestion to learn English using a web-based tool namely Write and Improve. Write and Improve is an English learning tool developed by Cambridge University. It has many features which allow English learners take the most benefit of the tool. At first, it invites the learner to write in English on broad topics within different levels, from beginner to business level. It also offers a preparation for IELTS test, a test that is used for University entrance in some Commonwealth countries. The learners can create their own workbook or join other workbooks. This feature also can be used for English teachers to share homework to their students and to make online assessment. Let's take a more detail example. When learners entering an Writing and Improve workbooks, for instance beginner level, they are asked to choose a topic and write an article (can be review, summary, or argumentation) for that topic. Writing and Improve (W&I) requires minimum word numbers to qualify a task is done. When learners accomplished this requirement, they can submit their works by clicking "Check" button.

As the new year starts, I have a few resolutions to make. First, I have to say that I am pretty satisfied with my school performance in general. Especially subjects like accounting, math and informatics are the ones in which I am on top already. The minor subjects could not work better either. I am a very ambitious student. That is why my grades are always As. On the other hand, improvements are still possible. Language courses are the one that would need the most improvement from my point of view. I would really like to be able to speak unprepared in every topic that may come up. Moreover, I also want to focus on grammar structures and my writing skills. In order to reach these goals, I intend to revise every day, using the help of certain online platforms. Next to this I really want to keep up the work I already do for school. Never give up!

In my opinion offices in separate rooms are more comfortable than offices, where most employees are in one room. Indeed, it is easier to help each other, but if an amount of your colleagues have to call important partners of the company the whole time, it can be really disturbing. Therefore, employees are not able to focus and concentrate on their own work and that is very inconvenient. Due the fact that the most people are working slower and more carelessly while they are being disturbed, not only the company suffers from it, but also the staff themselves. For instance, my dad is a clerk in a company, where all employees work in one room and he describes the situation as very uncomfortable and annoying, because his colleagues are on the phone the whole day. It takes him twice as long to finish his projects now. To put the main in a nutshell, an office with an open design is not quite right for employees, who have to focus on their own work.

I think that it is better to work enclosed workstations for different reasons. First of all, it can be very destructive if there is no walls betweeen the different offices. There are employees who prefer to work a calm environment. It is very important to protect those employees and give them right so that they can work a suitable environment. Furthermore not all employees in a company conduct the same work, so it is illogical to put all the employees in an open office. Secondly, because of the new Coronavirus it is very important to maintain the social distancing rules. To preserve this rule workstations would be a good idea. I know there are people who are thinking that the novel virus would sustain a limitate time. However the medical speciliasts are saying the likelihood that we get a new virus like this is significantly high. Moreoever there are companies who are struggling to maintain this rule, because of the open design. As we know it will last minimum 12 months to develop a vaccine, and the question would be of the vaccine would work.

I think that the future of travel is going to be not so polluting for the environment. I think that soon we are going to have flying cars, robots that are going to tell us to stop, all of the usual things that we are doing today are going to be made by robots. I don't think that the human beings can be replaced with robots, I don't think that is a good idea. We don't know what they are capable. I don't trust robots with artificial intelligence. So I think the best thing to do is to keep our head on our sholders, to try to think more about the dangers and less about the money, to think more about the humans and less about some bills. I think that our safety is more important then what robots can offer us. I think that what recommends them is: the speed, the fact that they will not be paid, they don't be late at work, they are never tired.

I think that this subject is a very boring one. I just woke up and my head is full of other stuff. I think that the "School of the Future" is going to change. Some of our schools have already changed, some of them have improved their teaching methods, some invested lots of money in order to improve and make education easier for their students. The only problem is the big difference between the schools' level. Some schools have invested lost's of money and are using technology to come closer to their students. For example, in Romania we still don't have toilets in most of our schools. We still don't have drinking water in our schools, we still pay for our education even if the government should pay for it. So first I think we should change the people that are responsible with those things, then to invest in education.

I think that the first purpose of the television was to bring the information closer to people. After a period the TV channels started to produce enterteiment videos and movies. They are a couple of channels that can bring education closer to the audience, but most of them are used to control the masses. A couple of them are TV News channels, other are specialized only in playing movies, and they a couple of channels that are doing all in one. The most watched channel from Romania I think that is Pro TV. It is one of the oldest channels. Some times I am watching Digi TV, but most of the times I am watching movies on Netflix. As you know Netflix is an online platform that gives you access to hundreds of online movies, the only condition is to pay your montly bill.

In my opinion, I think zoo it is a better place to let people learn about animals. such us, the families take their children to the zoo also, the schools take their students to gain information about animals, because of high level of safety and secure. But In other words the way to save animals rights and the people rights that is, putting animals in the zoo during specific period of time to let people see them and take pictures for learning or whatevers. The reason is if we allowed to people visit animals in their living place or forest it must be dangerous on their life, Due to no barriers or cages to prevent the attack from animals, and the rate of risk is too high. To find a good soluation and making balance between that is leaving the animals live in their place and create schedule to transfer them to the zoo for available visits for the families and schools.

Video games had double - edged sword. If we use it in right way that is allowed to the children play 1 to 2 hours on video games. The advantage of video games is allowed to the child intract with electronic device and learn the basic words and steps of using any electronic. Also it as assistace to the parents using the video games as a reinforsement if their son or dughture complete their homework or task. The disadvantage of using video game allowed to the children sit on it a long period of time, without tell them what the consequences of that. like eye problems and the stress on their bodies, the heavy weight. lack of concentrating.

If I would have to choose between money or my healthy I shall chose my healthy. Money are not so important if you can't enjoy them, if you don't have time to spend it. I think that we should keep a balance between work and our personal life. Life is too short just to make money, life is passing by and no fortune can by it back. I think that the biggest fortune is our healthy. If we lost it it's very hard to get it back. The strange thing is that people are running after money all their lives and after they have them they are using them to be again healthy. Then they are running again after money, but this time they can't get back their healthy. After that most of them are dying and have many regrats about how they lived their lives.

Studying at the university is a challenging time for both parents and children. Very often children have to move from their parents because a university is in another city. Whereas children, who live in a big city, where they have the univeristy, decided to stay at home with parents. However, sometimes even if the university is in the same city, children prefer living without parents. In my view a better choice is to live without parents while children are attending university. First of all, this is an excellent opportunity to let children to mature. Children start to live on their own and they have to take responsibility for their decisions and choices. They can ask their parents for advice, obviously. But they have to dotted their I's. And another thing is a fact that, as we know, students'life is time when children get to know new friends. In ceoncequence, children want to invite new people to their house for instance to party. Therefore, it's more comfortable to invite them to their own house not to parents' house. Without a doubt, more enjoyable meeting is with age-mates. Novertheless, as we know there are two sides of every strony. In a results, living with parents during studying has positive side too. While children are students and live with their family, they needn't to worry about many things such as money. After all, not everybody needs to free house to invite many friends. In summary, I honestly believed that is better to move away during studying time. It's a start of new, independent, adult life. Everybody ought to have time to grow up ad mature. To me, the best time for that is studying time, exactly.

It is maybe the most challenging decision for every student to find the university where they want to study at. Besides the question what they want to study, they will also question their self where they want to study and last but no least, where they want to live. After the students successfully applied for the university, they might need to move out. Luckily there are plenty options, where they can live. For some students the campus life will be the first choice, because they need other students around them. They like to share a bedroom and spending as much time as possible with other people. On the other hand, there are also cozy single bedroom apartments near universities. Some students are more introvert and do not like to have a crowd of other students around them. However, living on your own will let you also learn how to take care of yourself. There will be no mom, who cooks a nurishing lunch for you or washing your stinky, dirty socks. This will be all part of your experience. You will learn how to deal with it and it will be the best time of your life! Your family will always be by your side and they will also support you.

Today the videogames had devided the population in two sides, the first side is made of people who think that videogames have a negative impact on children, boys and men while the second one is made of people who thinks that the videogames are a way that can allow you to be whoever you want. Honestly I'm in the second group because i think that videogames are not negative. The are negative aspects if you play for too long. For example, playing 10 hours or longer without taking a break can make serious damage in the children/boys. This is the true problem. I do not know why some people think that video games are dangerous, but everyone is free to says whatever he wants. There are so many scientific studies showing the benefits of playing videogames, such as letting you make difficoult decisions in less time, or maybe making your eyes more powerful. By this I mean the ability to see more things moving etc... However, there are negative effects. As I said before, playing for too long can have a negative impact. It can make people have bad eyesight or suffer from strong headaches. Personally, I love video games. They let me go to places where i cannot go, do things that normal people can only dream. I consider them playable book.

The teacher is an important professional in the school environment. It is an important entity because it can teach you too many important things. In my opinion, on one hand having the same teacher every year is a good thing because this allows the student to study without problems. On the other hand, having a different teacher every year makes things more difficult for the student because he has a different method. I remember when I was at the second year of high school. My French teacher changed. So my classmates and I were so disappointed because we had to learn French differently. Our new teacher was strict but also fair. We liked her but 2 years later she left her job because her husband died. Then we had a different teacher, but we had so many problems with her because she made things too easy. Our grades were high but our skills were very poor. In conclusion, I think that having the same teacher is better.

It is better to attend those more important events to show that you care. When you have free time you can do exercise, you can play with your children sports, that is doing exercise, you can do a competition to make it more fun. Also it is very important to exercise because, is importany to our health, to keep a healthy body and a healthy mind. You need to do exercise when you have free time to be healthy, you can also, enjoy exercise by listening to your favourite podcast or music. I think it is best to attend the special events than doing exercise, but you should do exercise when you can.

Some high schools have a requirement that student must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Volunteer work can offer a large range of diversity. It can be to help homeless people, to teach a language to foreigners, or to pick up trash on the beach. They don't need to be in a large non-gouvernmental organisation to discover what volunteer work is. Students will encounter many opportunities, and can choose a realm where they feel comfortable in. High school is a period where children become adults and are questioning their beliefs and opinions. In my opinion that's an excellent idea for many reasons. Volunteer work presents many advantages for students. First, it's a work experience. And as any work experience it will help students to develop new skills and to build a professional network. Secondly, some teenagers might discover a new interest while working as a volunteer, and find out their path. Finally, volunteer work will lead young adults to meet people in need and will make them realise in which society they are living in. It will open their minds, and their beliefs, and it will help them to become more responsible adults. Even though I believe that's a great initiative, I think it might be difficult for young adults to manage their time. High shcool is already very demanding in therm of homework, adding volunteer work can lead them in some difficulties. The lack of free time can be very stressful for some teenagers. High schools demanding a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate must keep in mind these difficulties. Nevertheless, I am convicted that's a great idea.

Whether people should always tell the truth in any situations remains a highly continuous public discourse. Although it is undeniable that honesty is a worthwhile policy, I strongly believe that in some circumstances, not revealing the truth is an effective choice to protect both speakers and listeners. In the one hand, honesty is a valuable personality that everyone should have in order to archive a better life. In the contemporary society, people are likely to broaden their horizons and develop their soft skills by working with people. The fact has demonstrated that people can only co-operate one another through trust and honesty, which play an essential role in building a long-term relationship. Honest people will never flatter another and make the progress by their own qualification. Moreover, telling the truth is considered as one of the most effective ways to not only increase understanding and sympathy among people but also help people respect and appreciate differences of others. Therefore, many companies today choose employees, who are both qualified and reliable because they believe that these people will become powerful workforces for development of society. On the other hand, in some situations, lying is a better method to keep the relationship and avoid hurt one's soul. People were born with one mouth and two ears thereby being really easy to vulnerable when hearing bad things. Before saying anything, people should think carefully and find another suitable time to express their own opinion. It cannot be imagined how many patients will become negative and devastated if they directly hear their serious illness from doctors. Another impressive example is the way Napoleon Hill taught his deaf child, thanks to his white lie, his child could overcome any obstacles and become a successful man, who everyone extremely admired. In conclusion, telling the truth can have both advantages and disadvantages depending on specific circumstances. The aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for me to contend that thinking carefully before saying anything is of great importance.

Studying abroad is very popular nowadays. Many students decide to go abroad to high school or university. It's a fantastic way to make better your CV. However, it doesn't have only advantages, obviously. Neverthelles, as far as I can tell, I'm a person who would like to go to university abroad too. First of all, as I say, studying abroud is a very good way to make better your CV. Nowadays, many companies prefer to take a person with foreign university than a local one. To my mind, that person can seem to be more bold, more self-assured, which are meaningful attributes for directors. Equally important is that studying abroad is a valuable life lesson. A student goes abroad on his own, so he or she had to take control of his life. There will be no one, of course, who will make things except him. It doesn't mean that he or she will be alone, obviusly. Studying abroad is a superb way to make new friend, of course. But friends will not make dinner, clean the room or do laundry. Atually, we have here another paramount advantage which is making new friends and explore the world. As we know, people who traveld the world are more open-minded than someone, who stay in one place all life. But on the other hand, studying abroud can be stressful. A student goes to a place where he didn't know anybody. It is a new place, new world for him. Another disadvantage may be a language problem. Sometimes student can have a big problem with undrestanding something, and of course, it makes him stressful, as I mentioned earlier. In summary, I honestly believe that there is more advantages than disadvantages. Due to, to my mind, students should studying abroad, if their have a chance.

Every school class has at least two students who love to practise sports activities. On the other side. there are also some students, who are very lazy and hate sports. Many schools offer a gym or classes but not all of them are compulsory. The hard part of every school or university is now to find the ultimate balance between forcing their students to be active and not to over do it. Before I write more about the amaount of spots activities, I would like to catch up to the main importance of sports. Many cinical studies have proven that any kind of physical movement can boost your immunity system, improfe your cardoivascular system and prevents depressions. Those three examples are just a brief insight into the benefits of sports. Of course, no school or university has the ability to offer thousands of different spots options. They may give you a choice of elected classes. For example a running group, footballteam, chearleading classes or even a small gym with free weights. However, it does not matter what kind of sports you prefer, it just matters that you focus on your well being and health. Now, we can talk more about the amount of exercises per week. First of all, there is no golden rule for this. It really depends on waht kind of sports you practise and what goals each person has. To come back to the main question of forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week. It would be mirakle to follow this system but it's not realistic. Students should have at least one to two classes in their weekly school calender where they need to do some kind of sports activities. They should get the possibility to choose their preferences but they should not be forced to to three sports activities per week. Sports should still be a hobby and not a must!

Well, I think it's better have the same teacher for several years. It's better for the educational process, you know, the teacher can create something suitable for the student, individual educational plan for him. I think the relationship between student and teacher must be close, in an educational point of view. If that relation doesn't work, if it's umcomfortable for the student or the teacher, just in that case, has to be a change. Education has an emotional side that is important, some experts that I read said: "emotion goes before reason" which means, emotion influences the rational thinking more than we suspect. All the things that we think we feel them first. If we have a comfortable space to learn we'll learn how to think better. But despite that, people grow and need a different educational strtegy, and that has to come with a different teacher. A different teacher who will guide the student as he gets old.

I agree with the opinion that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Because we have much less chances to touch with and think about animals if zoos are prohobited. We also might not be concern about various animal problems. Of course some people worry about animals which are tamed in a zoo. But unfortunately nobody knows that animals really feel sad or have bad feelings. This is just an imagination by human. Then what we should do for animals is to think about animals and to do actions like a conservation. I think that there are mainly 2 tasks for zoo managers. First they shouldn't run only for their profit. They should take part in some actions for animals. They should never forget that they run with living creatures and they partly should work for animals. Second they must tell visitors the true stories about each animals. There might be a future zoologist. I hope that managers help children be more interested in animals. Anyway I want managers to run with a social responsibility. If they keep this condition, the above 2 things will come to be true.

I think that foreign languages are a very important days. If you manage to learn one or two foreign languages your changes to be hired are increased with more than 50%. If you want to learn a foreign language I think the best way you could do that is following an English course, to learn much easy the language you could watch movies, try to find a native person that could help you learn more easy, doing exercises at home will help you a lot. I recommend you also to use Duolingo to learn a foreign language. It's really helpful because you can write, learn and speak using Duolingo. One of the most important aspects if you want to learn a new language I think it is your determination. If you have the ambition to learn it you will succeed.

I think students benefit more from having new teachers each year, rather than to have the same teacher for several years. Each teacher has their speciality and character. If students have the same teacher for several years, they can't get new knowledge which the teacher doesn't know, they can't notice other points of view which the teacher doesn't have , and they can't feel comfortable if the teacher's character is not fit for them. If students have new teachers each year, they can get new experience from new teacher each year. New experience changes their opinion about something, the purpose of their life, and their future dream. Even if the new teacher isn't fit to the students, they just stand it for only one year and they can meet new teacher next year. It may take several days or weeks to become fit to new teacher every year, but it should give students great opportunity to know how to interact with other people.

I'm not only a generous and introvert person, but also a social person, so I really want to be a volunteer, especially when I am sitting on the school chair. I felt really happy when I saw that requirement. In my opinion, the students like me will have a lot of benefits when they take part in some social work and become volunteers. Firstly, they will feel happy when they help people or protect the environment. From that, they will have more and more motivated to do many good works and good behaviors. Secondly, they will have lots of chance to pracise many skills necessary for their future such as community skill, problem-solving skill and so on. Thirdly, they will recognise their advantages also their disadvantages through the real work. From that, they can promote their advantages and fix their disadvantages. Fourthly, if they become a vonlunteer, they can contact with many people so they can improve ability about the teamwork. Fifthly, through what they do when there was a volunteer, they will have a lot of good memories and many useful experiments. Finally, after graduated, they will have many good relationships and more friends. I hpoe the students should be a volunteer before they graduate.

When I was a child, I loved zoos. Animals are so amazing. We could learn about life, seeing them. And we could also learn about respecting them. But today I have other opinion, because, in some zoos, animals can't be happy. They have the rights to live in their own environment as we have. And in some zoos it's not possible because they don't offer good conditions of life. But at the same time visiting them, in their wild life, will be impossible for many of us. We will be an intruder in their home. So the zoos will continue to be an option. But they have to be bigger, to provide a home like their environment. It won't be cheap!! But if we think it will be the fair option. I can't see another one. But this structure has other problem. Maintaining these zoos is very expensive, so who will be able to pay for meeting the animals? Will it be available for poor children. Well, they have the internet but it, of course, will not be the same.

My opinion is that it is good to study abroad for a time during high school or university. There are 2 advantages. First you can learn something abroad which people live in Japan cannot experience. You have some different experience so that you have your own strong point and you can be succuessful in the future. Those who can think original idea are always needed for every fields. Second you can learn another language. It is defficult to learn language uncounciously as we get older. No matter whatever language you may study, it must be your strong point if you can master it. And if you can speak some language, you can communicate with many people. You can improve your personality with this experience. Otherwise there are also 2 disadvantages. First no one can know whether you can suit the environment where you will go. The risk to leave your hometown is more bigger than you expect. It is not big problems that you can check some information in advance like diseases or a culture. But you cannot check what the locals are like and how the weather and the humid influence on you. These are serious problems. Next if you think you will be successful as an elite in Japan, I don't recommend you to studying abroad. It may be not good as your career. Because the Japanese culture is so unique. And Many Japanese come to be conservative as they get older. You don't need to take an additional risk. You'd better enter a high school and a university in Japan. Anyway I approve of the opinion that students study abroad in his young days. The experience you got there is your treasure.

To bo honest I think that video games are dangerous. It rewards you with too much dopamin for too easy tasks. Everything else is so hard in comparison to games. Children do not want to do something useful because the dopamin rush produced by video games is so high. Everything else seems too boring and it decrease their productivity and development. One of the biggest problems is that video games can result in increasing violent behavior. Soldiers are learning huge responsibility with their weapons. It is strictly regulated when they can use violent and they know all the consequences. But in video games children are receiving good points for killing virtual enemy with no punishment for killing innocent people. They are used to killing. They are nurturing to kill without consequences. Another thing is that the video games do not reflect reality. You can drive virtual car at speed 200 mph and there is no danger of doing it. So why should you drive responsibly in real life if you do not know any better?

I have never liked zoos, the animal abuse it's sad to see. New technology will change things. People can learn about animals differently nowadays, for example, in Japan ceated a 7D Holographic Projection Display Zoo where you can get close to animals safely both for the animal and for visitors. This technology use different dimensions to capture an object (7 D). Reality has 3D space, we know that, but the reason why we are talking about so many dimensions here is because the hologram is captured from a large number of positions and each position described in 3D space. Each position captures a variety of viewing directions in 2D space. Two additional parameters are captured for each direction: image intensity and time. In other words, a 7D technology is like having a bounch of photographers surrounding an object. This technology is fascinating and can help us to get into the wild and learn about it without animal abuse. In the past zoos were important to us, opened our minds and helps us to see nature in a fantastic way, but time has change and we can do things differently.

My reasons for learning English I started learning English when I was 5 years old, but it wasn´t until I was 11, when I realised how much this language means for me. Firstly, talking about labour stuff, speaking English is such a useful way of communication, that will bring you a lot more of prestige when appliying for a job. That means that nowadays, speaking English is a big advantage that will help you to get better jobs. Secondly, English is really important thing in my life because it has helped me to figure out what I want to do in my life. (something I was struggling to descover). Thanks to that, I have learned a lot about the awesome American and English culture and their delightful people. To sum up, I really think that English is a very important language to learn nowadays,not only because it will bring you a great deal of opportunities, but also because it will help you to grow as a person and will open your eyes to the real world.

Television can educate us, but only on the surface. You do not know the sources of the informations from the television. You have watch with caution and check the information and make comparasion with other sources like books. The problem is that television needs to get your attention. So it has to be exciting or funny. And real events sometimes seem boring so the directors make them little more spicy. They for example connect two different events in to one or they may double the number of foe in historic battle. Education by television deeply depends on the quality of screenwriters and advisors. Usually the most capable scientist do not work for television. They write books and teach on the univerisities or work in bussnies. So I think that television can educate us but it cann't be primary source of knowledge.

Since I can face to many kinds of topics, I improve my writing skill wider and wider. Secondly, its marking speed. As soon as I push the check button, it marks and corrects my writings. It does save time a lot. Thirdly, its score history. I can see my past grades. It allows me to know how I improve my writing skill and stay motivated. Lastly, its design. It is very tidy and helpful to go around the service. However, I have one dislike point. It is its correct degree. It is very hard to understand where or how I can correct my writings to make it better one. It adds shades to the sentences, but not helpful. I want it to add more detail notes to my writings. Finally, I really rely on this service. I recommend you to start using it.

I must also mention that you don't have to wear coat or tights particularly gloves and a bonnet. Apart from that, it is not very possible to catch a cold or having flu like in Wintertime. Personally, I believe that Summer is like a sort of holiday for every body and it is not that bad even if sometimes we can have haye fever. But for me, Summer is the best season because the daylight last longer than in Wintertime.

The future of travel Nowadays everybody uses a way of travelling. Whether it is by a personal car or taking public transport people need to go to their job because the majority of them don't work near their homes. However, I think that in the future travel will be different. Technology is developed every day in order to help humans with their lives, so why creating new ways of travelling wouldn't be possible? I think that travel will change dramatically in the future. The trams might be suspended above the streets and descend where people need to get down. The cars' engine will work on more ecological fuel like compost or solar energy instead of gas. There will also exist more express trains which will travel all the way around a continent offering, in this way, the opportunity to see the world to more ordinary people. Whatever the future might bring, one thing that, I think, will not be changed for a good amount of time is the way in which airplanes work and look. These are already quite developed and I don't see what changes might be brought to them. The truth is that nobody can surely know what inventions will be brought to live in the future. But the thing I am sure of is that these will surprise us.

In my opinion studying abroad is the best way to improve the knowledge. As for improving language or about any else knowledge, living abroad offers the opportunity to exchange some experiences, so we can learn more. The problem is that living abroad is not always good for everyone. You miss your family and friends. You have to adapt to new cultures and sometimes it's against your beliefs. And you need some money of course, especially if you are from a country where your currency has less valuable than the country you are moving for. But when you are far from your family and friends you can establish new relatioships. You can reflect about how your life is going on. What is better for you. The way your country is living or the way of life of a different country. Of course studying abroad you are going to expand your social circle because you will meet people from different countries. Maybe and instead of disadvantages we will have more advantages studying abroad.

For me, the important and precious thing in our life is healthy. I guess there are a lot of people think like me but most of them don't care of their health much, especially the young people like university students and school children. I'm also a school student, so I will understand a part of young people think and the things they care much. Before, I was a lazy person about take care of myself, especially exercise and health, I had just concentrated about study, my goals and the way I could achieved these. I used to hate do exercise in the morning very much because I thought it wasted my precious time. Even my mother always reminded me do exercise or play some sports. But I often ignored them. Then some little problem about health came to me. Suddenly, I realized my faults in that time and I started care about my health more than before. There are a lot of reason for us to concern our health,especially do more exercise at least 3 times a week. Firstly, the health is the most important thing in our life. Our parents gave birth us very strong,have a good health, so we must have responsibility to protect our health through do exercise, play sports, change our bad habits and also lifestyle. Secondly, bad lifestyle affects our yield of work and study. We always feel tired, exhausted and don't have energy to continue the work. Finally, we usually unconscious, so we will have negative thinking and give the decision not good. So young people should play the sports at least 3 times a week. We will have feel betterand have more energy after each training session. We also have a lot of friends. It will improve relationships. There are a lot of benefits when we play the sports.

In my honest Opnion I think that do volunteer work it is a good activity to do, but nobody likes do volunteer work because this activity do not will give an award or money. People that are makes this activity are solidarity, and they are always thinking about the next person that need your help, do volunteer work it is not a mandatory, only make who want it. Unfortunately few people are trying do volunteer work, it is enough, we need more people help the old people, children with deficiency or other problems. That's the best idea ever, and everyone needs to be a little be solidarity with the next, because for example, in the future, probably us will need the help the younger people, money, clothes etc. Nowadays exist Non-governmental organization that help a lot of places in the world with help and donated other people, some people do not have so much money but, if you help a little bit, I'm sure that this little will make the difference in the world.

I agree with the opinions that video games can have a negative impact on children. They have many negative points and few positive points. To begin with, I'll show you two negative points. Firstly, their violental situation. Children cannot get to recognize the difference between real and virtual. Secondly, their time. Children may spend lots of time on play games. As a result they don't make time to study, which is the duty of children. Well, don't we have a compromise plan? Yes, we have. It is intellectual games. I think this is the only positive point the video games have. With play intellectual games, for example stuying games or puzzle games, children can activate their brain. It is very useful to improve their structure thinking. In conclusion, I almost agree with the opinions that video games can have a negative impact on children, but I also have a compromise plan that intellectual games can be valuable for children.

Firstly, Write and Improve provides me the opportunity to write English. If you carry on every day, it is meant to improve your English writing skill. Learning English is sometimes quite solitaly so it could be helpful to receive the correct sentences. Secondly, Write and Improve corrects my wrong words and wired sentences. We, Japanese, are careless of articles so much because this idea never exists in Japanese. Meanwhile, there are many intricated words which have similar meaning, thus we also struggle to find out appropriate words in each sentences. I think the native speakers feel that Japanese English is wired. We sometimes really don't know which word is correct in each sentences. However, Write and Improve teaches me the correct word in my sentences. Finally, I got to look up these intricated words in the dictionary. Write and Improve encourages me to learn English deep inside. Therefore, I strongly recommend my classmates to try Write and Improve and keep English practice.

Since I always have plenty of projects to carry out, I do not have enough free time, therefore as soon as I find some spare time, I appreciate it and try to utilize it effectively. I really enjoy reading ancient novels. Reading such books takes me away from the present time and provides me with a new environment to spread time in it, so I could find moments that I am living in another time far away from the chaos of my life. This is a relaxing activity and a stress reliever for me. I try to read these types of books every day and make it a habit and the last time I try it was a few minutes ago.

During quarantine, I found myself having a lot of free time on my hands. My English teacher advised me to practise my English with the help of " write and Improve." I really like that everything is automated. Therefore, you do not feel the pressure of someone judging you what gives me more freedom to write and practise. I also like it that the feedback is provided very quickly. This encourage me to write more and it keeps enjoyable. The only thing that can maybe improve the whole project, could be better feedback in grammar. I sometimes do not know why I am getting a low level score or way a sentence is wrong, even if the spelling is on point. Because I am dyslectic, it is very difficult for me to see my own mistakes in sentence structure. I would recommend "write and improve" to everyone who wants to write more in English. I think the best way to learn English, is to stay active with it.

At first, I'll tell you the advantages of studying abroad, after that the disadvantages. I come up with three advantages. Firstly, you can study what you are interested in more deeply than in your country. It leads your knowledge broaden. Secondly, you can learn the language spoken there as well as English, which is an international language. It leads you to be a global person. Thirdly, you can feel the culture there, which you don't touch unless living there. It makes you to understand the diversity of values.

Volunteer work is an absolute wonderful way to help others and grow within your experiences. People get the opportunity to help injured and sick children who are in hispotals or spend some time with animals in animal shelter. There are thousands of places where volunteer workers are hardly needed. I personally support the requirement from the high schools. The students shoudl be forced to learn that there are so many people who need our help. I am not just talking about hospitalized or homeless people. I am also focusing on the staff working there every day. They will be fore sure more than happy to get a helping hand. A most important point is to let the students chose their preferred working place. The motivation to complete a certain amount of volunteer work will be there as long as the student likes and enjoys the work he is doing. Further, the students will be impressed how much joy it will bring into their lives when they could lighten up the day of another person. No amount of money could pay this amazing and heartwarming feeling off. Have you ever looked into the big, shiny and happy eyes of a thankful kid? Yes, it is amazing! Besides the joyful opportunity of helping others, the students will also learn how hard work looks like. It is the perfect preparation for the life after high school. However, the volunteer work will teach every student a lifelong lesson. They may even find inspiration for their future work places. I am very sure that some students will love the feeling of helping others and they could spend some month abroad and work perhaps in South America or Africa.

As every grown person in the 21st century ought to know, not every human looks, feel and desire the same from one other. Due to these facts, in order to respect each individual's personality, a considerable amount of freedoom should be given to each person. Among the concept of freedoom, free choice is an essential issue. On the one hand, despite I might sound quite idealistic. I have to say that I strongly respect and understand the importance of rules, without them our society would be an anarchism and daily life would be like putting an elephant into a car. However, as it regards to volunteer work I have a completely solid point of view and I will wholeheartedly deffend it. The reason why I am so concerned about this topys is that I absolutely believe that there are certain things that appear from the deepest part of our soul, and forcing those feelings and emotions result in an awful ending. Volunteer work is not for everyone, those courangerous people who dare to volunteer have some kind of magical attitude inside themselves. Therefore, Incluiding this activity as compulstory at school couldn't be more useless. Nevertheless, there are endless activities to do in order to teach solidarity and empaty such as playing a team sport or planting trees. In conclusion, considering all things carefully mentioned above, as far as I am concerned, only those who hugely desire to volunteer should do so. It does not mean they are better people, they just have something special to give to those people who absolutely need their help

I think that the schools in the future will be much more modern, because I think that we will see robots that will be teaching class instead of humans, there will be screens resembling notebooks, the luncbox won't be necessary, the parents will send droids with their lunch, to the children and pick it up. I think the homework will be all sent and done on a screen or on a computer. Maybe the reces time you will be able to use your cellphone to play video games all the time. And when you finish school, a mega fast car will take you back to your house in no time while you do homework or play with your cellphone. The mega fast car inside will be very confy and a table to work inside! I think how schools will be in the future.

The both has the benefits and drawbacks. When students have the same teacher for several years, the teacher meant to know them very much individually. Therefore, whenever they need help, the teacher would give you hands appropriately. While the teacher who know them very much may be like your friend and could not get to make a fair decision. Contrary to say, when students have new teachers each year, they could keep nurvous until they get in touch with the new teacher. However, once they have got round to take up a good relationship with the new teacher, they enjoy everyday life to keep or improve the relation with the new teacher. Personally speaking, I think the new teacher would be better for education because all students get to learn how to make a good relationship with the new person. I strongly think that it is inevitable experiences in the social life.

Recently, the world has dramatically changed. Due to the globalization people started to be interested in other cultures. I think that learning to speak a foreign language in more important nowadays than in the past. First of all, technological development has made travelling so much easier. If we want to communicate with other people while being abroad we have to be able to speak in a language which is commonly used, such as English or Spanish. What is more, studies have shown that learning languages helps our brain to work more efficiently. If we want to be able to speak fluently we have to be constantly exposed to the language and practise our memory. On the other hand, some people claim that the knowledge of a foreign language is not useful nowadays because of the technological devices which we have. The usage of online dictionaries fully enables us to communicate with other people in any language we want. To sum up, I think that learning to speak a foreign language nowadays is more important because it makes communicating with people so much easier and helps our brain to stay efficinet longer. We should not be dependent on online devices because they can stop working in the least expected moment.

Nowadys more and more people worry about their health than ten years ago. They visit doctors regularly and go on special diet. But they forget that without money they are not able to make their dreams true. In my opinion, be healthy is more important than to be rich. Firstly, if you are healthy you can go to work and earn money. If you are a good worker, you can be promoted fast. What's more, when you go to work you are stay in touch with your colleague and friends. It helps to develop and balance you emotional health. Secondly, health is important when you have a family. Without health you are not able to bring up your children properly. If your health is no good enough you waste your free time during visiting doctors instead of playing with your children. Finally, you can lost opportunity to build special relationship with them. On the other hand, money help to make your dream true. Furthermore, with them your life is easier and more comfortable. You don't have to worry about the future. To sum up, health is the most valuable thing in our life. Without this our life could not be happy and full.

I think that students benefit more from having new teachers each year. When I was a child, I have the same teacher for two years, her name was Miss Matilde. It was in first and second grade. The teacher was a wonderful person. She was patient with us. Also was a very experienced teacher. In fact, she taught us to read and write. After that, we felt bad when we passed to third grade with a new teacher, her name was Miss Martha. Miss Martha was a little more serious than Miss Matilde, or I sometimes think that she was more seious because we older than two years before and she treated us as third grade children. It was ugly to us. I think that all of us expected that Miss Matilde would be the teacher again. We missed Miss Matilde. We said to the Director General that we wanted Miss Matilde again, so she told us that the teacher should be changed every year in order to students know new people and develop new skills. Now I agree with Dirctor General.

I think that a lot of people will prefer to live a very adventurous and intense life. They'll think that studying, reading and such things are boring. Those things belong in a boring life. They will define a life that is calm, but long as boring. Then there is the kind of people who would like to live a long and calm life. They think that they'll get all out of life if they live a calm and long life. In fact, I don't think that I want to choose either ways of life. I want to see things in life. I want to hear, feel and experience things in life. I want to live life to the fullest. But that doesn't mean I don't want to grow old. I would very much like both of these to a certain degree. I want to live life to 'the fullest', but I want to grow old as well. I want to love. I want to read. I want to grow old with my partner. I guess you could see that as living a calm and long life. I don't think you have to make a choice between the two. I think that you could have a very adventurous youth, and when the time is there, you start to live calmly again. You'll settle down, have children, and grow old.

Throughout the years, we have been hearing that telling a lie is not an acceptable behaviour, but why? I personally think that telling lies and being truthful is an essential quality maybe because lying gets you in trouble and make you seen as not honest which ends up making you unwelcomed in society especially if you wanted to fit in. However, I believe that there are certain situations that lying is considered to be a good thing, nobody can not argue on the fact that lying can be a necessity sometimes but being honest is also a necessity, I do not believe in white lies, they all are lies after all but it is totally acceptable if needed for making a small complements, not trying to embarrass people and such things. I try to be honest as much as I can and I try to avoid lying, nonetheless I view lying as taboo in issues that requires being completely honest because I find it much easier to accept myself, that is, if I lied in situations I should never lie in, my conscious would punish me that I can not live with myself any more. An example of telling a lie is acceptable and OK for me is when a friend asks me how the food is and I find it too salty, it is one of these funny and small stations that wont do any harm of any effect in future.

I think there are two things that are more important for our health than exercise. They are sleep and diet. Unless we have a standard healthy body, we cannot do appropriate exercise to improve our health. In order to get the body, enough sleep and balanced diet are essential. Firstly, without enough sleep, we suffer from disordered condition such as anemia. In addition to that, we will have rough skins. They make us sad to live a healthy life. Secondly, without balanced diet, we suffer from less energy such as lack of motivation. In addition to that, we will get fat. They make us disappointed to do anything. On the other hand, with these two compositions, we are ready to get an exercise. Exercise is the most important activity to live a healthy life in this condition. It is better to do only a little exercise than do nothing. As for me, I began to train my muscles to get a beautiful body. It is very interesting because I know how changed my body. I'll keep motivate myself to achieve my goal.

I think the way of travel will be different, however the aim of travel might still be the same in the future. Firstly, the way of travel should be different. It is going to be extreme, which is going to the further away or staying at home. Thanks for research advance, we will travel the universe for example to the moon, or to Mars. Space travel would be popular in the near future. On the other hand, thanks for technological development, we will travel virtually for example via own PC. In spite of sitting at the table, we can experience the scenery where we want to visit. Secondly, the aim of travel would be the same. Travel is one of the ways to escape from the daily life to unusual life in order to take a rest. This is the humans' instinct. I hope it waon't be changed. In conclusion, this is just my idea of the future travel. I am looking forward to seeing the answer in the future.

It is clear that human have their own behaviour and thinking. Some people at think, telling the truth is the main behave in your life but lying is the best way to cover your positive or negative things. From my view point, tell lie is the most powerful way to cover your things. To begin with, everyday people are always telling the truth it will not be because if you are optimistic the manager or CEO, someone may be ask you about your future plans or how to control about your company. Will you talk to him directly about how to work? If he is so naive or out of his mind, hw will talk about it. And also, some of information I overheared from someone, he said that "using NOT everywhere, you will not lose your items and money will be rolling in." Likewise, I regard that instead of saying positive than negative. On the other hand, you are always lying to everybody, people will be unfriend or keep away from you and consequently, they will be said that " he is lair, do not making with him friend, if you make friends with him, you might not get real information." That's why everyday could not only tell truths and tell lies, everything fair and square is the most tremendous to behave in the world. Nevertheless, you have to use your worlds on circumstance of situation. In conclusion, you could not change other person mindset and thinking but you need to balance how situation behave negative or positive. Undoubtedly, lying is irritable to other person but good for you.

This practice has grown form year to year. For instance, in public transport we almost see no one use their mobile phones. This habit often disturbs convenience use of public facilities, including public transport. To reduce or avoid this practice, banning the use of mobile phones should be implemented. Among all activities using mobile phones, the use of mobile phones to make calls, including video calls, should be strictly prohibited. This policy will prohibit people to overuse their mobile phones. Other activities, like listening to music, including watching video; read books or articles; and other activities which do not make any noise; should be allowed. This rule should be clearly written in every pubic facility, including public transport. The implementation of the rule could be different between public facilities. For instance, we prohibit making calls in public transport and restaurant, but we allow it at the train station building. There is should be an exception in which all people are allowed to make emergency calls, wherever they are. Furthermore, the exact rules should be discussed among different kinds of people: worker, civil servant, and students. By implementing the banning of mobile phones usage, the convenience of using public facilities like public transport and restaurant, should be improved.

For many people, honesty is one of the most important vritues. It is generally known that people dislike liars. But could it be true that in some situations, it is better to lie than to always speak the truth? In my opinon, lying isn't always bad. In fact, sometimes telling a lie is the only right thing to do, and I would like to explain why. To begin with, sometimes it is more convenient for yourself and others to lie than to tell the truth. For example, to compliment a friend's new outfit, although you don't really like the clothes, but you are just being polite. In this particular case, lying is the easiest way to avoid unpleasant situations. It would be unkind if you did not say anything at all but being honest and saying their clothes are ugly would be rude too. Therefore, telling a white lie like in the given example isn't that bad after all. Secondly, lying could also save lives. To illustrate, in the second world war, some brave people had Jews in hiding in their homes. It is due to those selfless people some Jews managed to survive the war. If those people didn't risk their lives, lying to the Nazis and disobey their orders, even more people would have died. Therefore, I think we should be thankful some people are dishonest from time to time. In conclusion, sometimes lying is better than speaking truth Of course, people shouldn't be dishonest all the time, but in certain situations, it's acceptable to tell a lie.

In my opinion it is better to have many teacher through the years. Each teacher has value, some problems teaching, some tips to get better, so it is important to children and teenagers to have several teachers. I guess that any opportunity needs to use it. My daughters have different teachers, each for each disciplines. My younger girl prefer science teacher. My older girl rather the math teacher, so for different children need different teachers. In the future they can meet other great teachers that will influence all their lives. The trajetory of the students, they have various moments, depends on the age, of the mood, of the stage of life, so several teachers can help them. Despide these questions I think that meet different people is very important to learn to find challenges, so I think that the same teacher along years could not offer this for their lives.

Some people believe that zoos are good places to learning about animals, but belonging in nature is a good way. From my view point, they both have their own benefits and drawbacks. To begin with, if the government provide the zoos, people will have more chance to keep in touch with animals, which their living style and transformation. Even though you are not zologists, you can also learn about their life cycle and their strengths and weaknesses. For example, monkey are almost like human which are 99.2% same with humans. If the zoos are not opened, yet people have never chance to study their behaviors and features. On the other hand, animals should not be kept in cave which can affect their life cycle, reproduction and even dead. For instance, crocodile, you can see their life changing in nature and their transforming in zoos are thoroughly different. In nature, they have more strengths and wilder than in cave. The other example, keeping in the cave can affect reproductive system due to the fact that the place is tiny and monotonous partnerships. I believe that if you want to research their life styles or life cycles, why do not we go to see their inhabitants? You can see through not only their changes but also landscape of the nature views and also can take a selfie. For instance, in Singapore, they occupy people under ground water tunnel which was built under the Pacific Ocean from there you can see any kinds of sea creatures such as whales, sea cucumbers and jellyfish etc. In conclusion, keeping in the zoos also have advantageous and disadvantageous, hence, I do prefer to keep them in free.

The future school Did you like the school, school life, teachers or subjects? And also what did you wish them? I think some points might be changing in the future. Firstly, some schools will change to the online class for example countryside schools. Usually there are not enough students or the school is too far. Of course, the city or town schools will also change to the same. However, teachers who don't change to robots go on humans. Robot teachers couldn't be making mistakes but they couldn't be understanding students feeling. There are disadvantages in this school style. Students couldn't talk to friends face to face or couldn't get communication skills. And parent or grandparents need to stay home together with children. In addition, I think the fixed school grade disappear. If some students understand this grade's subject more than other students, they can go to the next grade quickly and they will graduate earlier than others. And then, their ability might be used companies or politics immediately. The schools are important for students that's why they need to change much better way.

Health and wealth are influencing each other. In poor countries with no healthcare people try to stay alive and in rich countries they are healthy and changing their body for beauty reasons. I agree with the statement: " It is more important to be healthy than rich." On the one hand you cannot enjoy your richment if you are sick. On the other hand you have no chance to get better if you have not any money. In Germany we have a really good health system and everyone can have a health insurance. It is different in America with no access to health care for everyone. In this country to be poor means eventually to die. But I think health is the most important subject and we need to think about how to improve it. All in all it is necessary to find a balance between wealth and health. Every person needs to find this balance on their own. However it is also important to create or provide healthcare for more people. Nevertheless health is most important.

Working is inhenrent to our lives as when we reach the adult age, we need to get a job in order to earn money to survive. Only if you start your own company will you be more than just a simple employee, at least at the beginning of a career. Being a simple employee means you will have to submit yourself to the conditions the company you work for gives you. In some companies the employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles while in others there is a more open and modern design. For example, there are no walls separating co-workers from each other. Clearly, these two different models of offices have advantages and drawbacks: in the first example, you have more privacy and silence, and the environment promotes concentration; whereas the second one you have the chance to take advantage of the interaction with your partners. It is easy to dialogue with the others and you never feel alone. Considering all I have mentioned before, if it were me, I would prefer to work in a cubicle as I would be more focused, and therefore, productive. If I needed help, I would go to the next office and ask for an opinion.

First of all, I have two ways about the school of the future, the first is about the technologies. Personally, the school of the future should be more technological because the technologies grow up very quickly in the world and also because the technologies are really useful for many things there is no doubt about it, for example you can do your work more rapidly, you can search everything and also learn more easily thanks to the many website on the internet. Moreover, in the future all students will have computer or tablet for working in the classroom I guess.

For example, studying a new language in a new country is the best method to improve yourself. However it has a huge difficulty at the beginning, because you do not understand what other people tell you, or explain to you. After spending some time in that country the difficulty subsides, i. e. you understand what people tell you. However, there are also negative aspects to living in another country. One of them is that you have to follow their local traditions, which can be different from ours.

Studying English is one of the most beautiful things to do. I started to say some words when I was 5 years old. Then when I was 8/9 years old my family and I decided to have trip. We went to America to see my uncle's family. When I went there I was so surprised to see that I had English native-speaking cousins. I was so excited because that gives me a reason to prove myself. When I came back, I became the number one in English in my class. I was so happy to see my classmates so jealous of my skills. Later I went to high school when I started to study the English grammar. Once I realized I was able to make sentences, my decision was made: I had to get better in this language. Now I'm studying to pass the B2 exam.

Some people believe that studying for several years with the same teacher is superb but new teachers for each year have more advantageous. Based on my knowledge, I am going to outline same teacher for studying several years have upsides. They believe that studying the same teacher, students are already understood about their teacher like and dislike, thus they will behave like good person behaviors. Students and teacher can keep in touch with each other like friendly, open-minded without paranoid. If the teacher age tend to be young, she will behave her pupils like her brothers and sisters. However, same teacher for four or five years teach the students who may not be respect to her or guide to their subjects will be monotonous. Sometimes, she loves to her students forgiving their mistakes gives them more marks and favour, which is going to trouble to them if they are planning to the further studying. Besides that, it is mentioned that diverse teachers have their own benefits and drawbacks. They believe that different teacher chase dissimilar styles and new methods which can make them brain-storming and more creative. Students will be terror and look up to the teachers which can boost them to study more and more. On the other hand, they might misunderstanding about how she is talking about? For instance, when I was young, my mother was encouraging me to get better experiences,hence,she pushed to change many teachers which idea drove up to the wall. I did not use to know about their lectures therefore I was not got sensational high marks. And last but not least, some teachers want to show their powers to students to look up to her sometimes might be strict. From my view, I am prefer to go with the same teacher because students and teacher already built their relationships and get to know each other who students are weak in which subjects, other students have strengths in other that is why she can thoroughly control them to get grade A+. So, in a nutshell, students have the same teacher for several years, having new teachers both have upsides and downsides. In my opinion, Undoubtedly, I would definitely go to the same teacher for several years.

The majority of people are made for socialcontact and interaction. The walls of cubicles rob you from making these connection with your colleagues. You do get some additional own space and privacy with walls, but this comes at a cost. When you open up your office, a couple of things will happen. People will be able to see one another.

There are secondary school were you first need to spend a certain amount of time on charity work before earning your degree. This can for example mean that students help by giving English to refugees or maybe work at a homeless shelter. There are a lot of lessons students are able to learn from this type of work. Volunteer work teaches children to not only think about their own situation, but also about the situations of people less fortunate than them selfs. Not everybody has the same opportunities in life. A little help can make a lot of difference for somebody in need. Because of the fact that you need to do some voluntair work to graduate, it will force people (that would normally not do charity work) to try it. These students are pushed out of their comfort space. You never know, maybe it will even change their opinion about it. It can maybe broaden their view. Starting volunteer work at a younger age will make it feel more normal. It will also increase the chance that students will do more volunteer work in the future. We need new volunteers every year. Inspiring young people to step up can make a difference in maintaining a steady stream of voluntaisr.

Speaking is thinking. The way of how people think can be measured by its spoken language. If people tell a lie, they cannot be trusted. To lie is an unacceptable action, except in emergency conditions. Always tell the truth is important. People can obtain trusts from others by always saying the truth. Trust is an important reward in a society. When we are studying at a university or working at a company, obtaining trust is a top priority once we entered a new environment. Lying, in opposite, will make us in marginal zone at which we can easily be dropped off from that zone. Telling the truth is also safer than telling a lie. Although it is difficult to tell the truth in some conditions, telling the real case not only makes us unloaded physically but also mentally. The habits to tell the truth -- without any addition and deduction -- will strengthen the quality of life. Correct data will deliver the right decisions. In contrast, fake data will result in the wrong decisions. There is a case when to tell a lie is acceptable. A lie can be accepted when someone in danger and telling the truth will put their safety in danger. In this case, the only way is to tell a lie. Nevertheless, everything should be explained in truth once the problem is solved.

Indeed, speak an other language is very useful for many things as for your job or to get around, there is no doubt about it. Therefore some people try to learn a new language such as a native speaker from their target language indeed today more and more people are learning a foreign language to find a job more easily. To give you an example, in 2012 when I worked for a travel company, I didn't speak English but I had to do it, so I was learning English until I spoke this very well because I needed that to exchange with some foreigner. Moreover, I think today you should be able to speak a foreign language because of metropolization. To explain to you what's means Metropolization, this is a kind of opened border and an exchange program between several countries, this is a political device made to do more business and also do more exchange between some country like in Europe with the "Schengen space" consequently you may be related to someone who doesn't speak your language and this is actually true by the way.

Write and improve provide a huge number of topics and they divide all the topics into three categories beginner, intermediate, and advance. Users as per their own convenience can choose the topic and write up to 300 words. They have also provided topics related to business. This category is useful for professional people who wants to improve their business English. The topics in this category are few and limited in subject. They must include more variety of topics so that more practice related to business English can be performed. One more feature, they have included that is test zone. This category is for people who is preparing for IELTS. Here, the topics are listed similar to what come in IELTS exam. Sadly, this category is chargeable, and after one review they continuously ask for subscription. The most important parts of this portal are feedback and progress. Here, they check, mark the mistakes, and give suggestion for correction. The over all review system is excellent but lack in detail. The highlighted part does not mention the mistake in detail, and also do not suggest the correct way of writing, however it shows the proficiency and CEFR level. To summarise, this is the best website I have found where topics and proofread both features are available.

For TV programs, there are news, discussion, and education programs. As TV broadcasts them, people input wide variety of information passively, even though they are not interested in them. It not only broadcasts them, but also explains if we need in detail. People acquire wanting information just watching TV. Or, it could be the threshold of learning new subjects. Moreover, we could learn even from entertainment programs for example comedy and music. We could get the knowldge of how to occur laugh or compose songs. When we watch TV from a different perspective, we could find new things which we have not noticed. Everything is a seed of learning. TV will never be a tiring device, it should be enjoyable forever. In conclusion, I think television educates people as well as entertains.

In children, video games is more popular than last decade. Some people believe that video games which can influence negative on children and other people do not believe it. From my view, they both have their own drawbacks and benefits. Based on my knowledge, I am going to outline about negative impact on the children. Most people, especially parents, they do not control their children; hence, the children will be playing some 18+ video games, thrilling or ghost hunting which could be threat to them. Sometimes who plays the video games too much he will behave in real life like games. For example, I read from some article, a young man just round 10 years old who plays PUBG games. In that games you can jump from the four storeys to gound, so his brain was impact with that knowledge a lot, consequently jumped out from the fourth floors which made him dead. However, beside that, it is mentioned that playing video games can get many positive effects such as brighter, brainstorming and can calculate faster.

When the examination was near, I did some tricks how to pass the exam due to the fact that of the playing the video games.

Playing video games can keep in touch with international person which can progress not only personal abilities and mindset but also language skills. Some parents desire to go back to the nineteen century thinking. Video games were designated esports which include in sports. As, in the nutshell, elderly person must keep up up to the minute changing things video games also include in the 21st trend. Most people have better accept the video games if their children play video games earlier, they will have more opportunities than without playing one.

It seems to me that work in cubicles is more effective. Because when you work with no walls separated one and the others, it’s going to be noisy. Even the sound of someone clicking keyboard by your side, might make you out of focus. Focus is really important for us while doing something. You can be more productive when you all by yourself thinking about what you’re going to finish. Even though you can’t communicate with anybody, all the attention move to your duty so you can easily focus at it. Sometimes, being alone by ourselves make us know ourselves better than ever. And all of a sudden you might find some creative ideas that you never expect before. Don’t worry about the other workers, we can still catch up with them when the break time come.

As the positive aspects of this platform, I can mention that I have become more aware of the vocabularies dictation and their use in the text. Also, I am trying to use the appropriate collocations and writing a little bit longer sentences. Furthermore, my progress motivates me not to give up and to appreciate the small steps to success in writing a high-quality essay.

when I was a child, video games were already quite diffused, but over time their spread has increased. This incseasing is due by one side to the technological progress, by the other to parents who are always busier and busier every day and don't have time - neither patience - to stay with their children. I've often seen exhausted parents giving their mobile phone to their children, so that they would have stayed quiet for - at least - the following thirty minutes. I've also seen children who didn't care going out with their friends, preferring instead to play with their xbox. This is a serious problem and Governs should try to solve it, getting on the very useful help of childood psychologists and schools. I think children should be encouraged to spend time outside, playing, running, going on the roaller, byking. They need to understand what it means to stay in the nature, they need to have time to explore what they are surraunded from. Moreover, having contacts with Nature can help to develop stronger anticorps, which are always useful. Video games, if abused, can bring a child to believe what happens it them is real: so that maybe they can learn to believe that social relationship should be based only on social media interations or that it's fair and consented by the law to kill, bit or invest by car someone. Children should play video games for a limited and defined period of the day also to preserve their view. Video games are however a good option to spend some time in the day, maybe one hour or a little more, to socialize with friends if it's raining and it's not possible to go outside and to develop confidence with technological istruments since the youngest age, because learning havin fun is always a good thing.

I agree with volunteer work as a requirement to get graduated. For many years volunteer work has been a requirement that high schools students must complete in order to graduate. When I was a high schools student, I worked in the school's library in order to clean, classify and arrange the books. Others plant a garden in the school, taught mathematics to younger students or help in the City Hospital. The experience taught me to manage the time. Also, I learned to be more tidy and responsible because of the classification and arrangement work. I learned that I had a boss who manage the work. I understand that the boss should teach but sometimes he doesn't do it. And finally, the boss always makes the rules.

I find this topic interesting. I have never given a thought about it but I have my choice related to the office furniture for employees. I am listing the important points which should be considered for finalizing the office design that are most appropriate for employees. These are:- 1) As employees sit with their co-workers, adequate distance must be maintained. 2) Two employees who are sitting adjacent should not be able to see each other computers or works. 3) All employees can be seen from one end. 4) Hall should be airy enough for maintaining good hygienic. 5) People who are dealing with clients must have sitting arrangements in front of them. 6) we must maintain Sufficient space between two workstations. Considering the all points as mentioned above, we can think of better design of office furniture. I suggest the design which has two desks i. e., two employees can work simultaneously.

The fundamental idea sounds great. I support the idea that kids should do some work. There are so many children that do not know what the work really is. The only problem is the word "volunteer." Why call it that? Is it some kind of political correctness? If they have to do it it was not volunteer work. And it is ok. Let's be honest and call it duty. Duty is an important part of life, too. Children can learn the basic aspects of their duty in the school. Without these programmes the children wouldn't be able to value the hard work which is done be working people around them. The hard work will make them humble and it is the most important part of the idea. Children should be humble or they will be humbled. Nothing is for free. Their parents can buy them stuffs but to graduate they have to work. And that is right.

Nowadys many teenager became hardless and not interested in life members of their family and friends. They pay attention to life which is at social media. In my opinion, it is wonderful idea that some high school a require studets to do some compunsolary volunteer work. Firtsly, volunteer work learn responsibility for others. It puts emphasis how importatnt is give helping hands to homeless or elderly people. It could improve realtionship between grandparents and gradchildren.

On the other hand, if teenager do something under presuer they became rundess. They ignore advice their parents or teacher. Next, they try to invent as many excuces as they can to avoid volunteer work. It is a waste of time for them. To sum up, do volunteer work at school is useful.

The best holiday of my life was 10 years ago. My family and I went to Portugal for a week. Evidently, Portugal is a great holiday destination because of the landscape and the ocean. Still, there is another reason why it is my favourity trip. Since I was a little girl, I dreamed of swimming with a dolphin once. This dream came true during my vacation in Portugal. A few days after we arrived, we visited a water park called "Zoomarine." The park itself was already pretty fun. There were various water slides and you could watch different shows. However, the best about this park was the possibility to swim with dolphins. After a short instruction we were able to join them in their pool. I even had the opportunity to swim with one of them alone. As you can see, this was an experience I was looking forward to a lot. As a result, this was the best holiday ever and even one of the best moments in my whole life.

For my opinion, I think have the same teacher for several years is a bad idea. I think students benefit more from having new teachers each year for a simple reason. After their studies, in their job, they will be obliged to work with other colleagues, not just one during their career. Moreover, according to me, it is more interesting to work with new teacher each year because it allow to discover news ways of thinking. They can bring more knowledge than one teacher. Of course, if students don't like the teacher maybe they like the new. Even for the teacher, it is more interesting for him or for her to discover news students. I know it because my parents' are teachers. Finally, it is helpful for the two parties because they can meet new people. If students like teacher, they can keep contat with him. If they don't like him, they are not obliged to keep in touch.

Zoo are places where animals in different circumstances live. There are a lot of zoos around the world with different priorities and charactersitics. Nowadays, most of zoos work with endangered creatures or abuse animals from circuses or contraband, but there are also a few zoos who work as an entertainment place specifically and that's why people often argue about animals being enclosed in unnatural habitats called zoos. They say that species who are separate from their freedom have several consequences like stress, mentally ills or even suicides. Animals protectors also debate about the space where animals live. They argue even if the zoos have the "adequate" space and conditions to stay animals, they still are in captivity. However, zoos in opposite say that they do an important work to preserve wildlife. Zoos say that their breeds and rescue programmes help to preserve endangered animals or study different illness and their treatments. Even, they do an important work teaching children about the value of biodiversity giving them a real experience with animals and wildlife to create ambient awareness. As I see,zoos have pros and against for wildlife. These kinds of places many times help animals who has been abused or need be rehabilitated to be insert into their natural enviromnent. Even though zoos help a lot to preserve wildlife they still stay animals captive that's why I strongly believe that it should be an agreement between zoos and hunters to respect wildlife. I mean that people should help and treat vulnerable creatures and try to re-insert them into their natural enviromnets as soon as possible using zoos as a tool to preserve and help vulnerable animals.

These days, mobile phone has become an integrated part of our daily life. Wherever we go or do, a mobile phone is always remained with us. The technology associated with mobile phones are kept on upgrading and we can perform a lot of things. The mobile phone was invented for communication and now, it can perform all kinds of job for which we use a computer or laptop. Beacuse of the various social media apps which is very attractive and very difficult to get rid of are the major factor which enhanced the use of mobile phones. I do not agree to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurant. The town council wants to limit the use of mobile phones in public places so that people around the mobile phone user should not get disturbed. I will suggest that instead of banning mobile phones, the town council must start an awareness program regarding the benefit of limited uses of mobile phones in public places. Besides this, the town council should start penalizing the people who use the mobile phones other than the emergency work. For more awareness, poster and advertisement should be done in every public place, it helps the user to understand the importance of limited mobile phone uses. After a few weeks of advertisement, the town council can start penalize the users and gradually people will cultivate the habit of not using mobile phones in public places..

There are always arguments about zoos: by one side they're really appreciated, especially by children, by the other they're strongly criticized, especially by young people and animalists. Zoos shouldn't exist the way they actually do. We always see animals living in places - or to better say cages - within really different conditions from their original habitats. Animals seem to live in another world, far away from our reality. They often have an astonished expression, as if they had been hypnotized. They look tired and their movements are extremely slow. Captivity deprives them of their natural freedom and makes them dolls to admire behind a glass. I've been taken to zous too when I was a child, and sometimes I've visited them more recently. When I was a child I was excited - as it is normal a child is - to see animals I didn't even know existed, but right now I understand that it's not good. Right now, six bears are living in the Orecchiella Park, locked in cages of 60 square meters and forced to stay all the day under the sun: they seem to be suffering quite a lot the heat of the summer. In zoos, animals lose their predatory abilities too, because they always get food both from visitors - who give it them despite the bans - and from zoo's employees. I prefer more safaris and natural parks, because the animals that live there can benefit from better conditions and walk and run in larger spaces, often quite similar to their natural habitats.

It is clear that the future of travel their own have different and the same. In this essay, I am going to demonstrate different and the same. Based on my knowledge, there will be having four main sources of travelling long systems such as bus (coach), normal train or underground, airway and cruise. Coach system is almost nearly the perfect that is why there is no way to changing a lot. Even though normal train system is slow, farmers, cultivation person and who stay in the outskirts person are relied on that due to the fact that it is cheap and accurate. Underground railway is absolutely accomplished, will not change in future. Most people believe that there will become supersonic speed train appearing soon. On the other hand, airway system will not be dead because we all rely on the aircraft to travel aboards. Some of scientists are planning to announcement about gigantic aircraft, faster speed and could allow us to board more than one hundred people. And last, but not least, cruise is also support a main in transportation. I read some article in the newspaper, cruise will have more luxurious such as play ground, swimming pools and shopping centers etc and also more fast, accurate than past. Secondly, hotels are the biggest changing in the future. Instead of human there are planning to replace with robots. For instance, China, some pricey restaurants, especially hotpot, if you order some side dishes, they come with robots and serve on your tables. And another example, in Japan, hotel staff are running with all robots, can show you which room did you reservation and give you some lunch, dinner box and morning breakfast. My personal point of view, food will be changing consequently, the traditional cuisine are replacing with fast food which it is the most I concerned. As, in the nutshell, I think following things will be changing in the near future.

Studying in another country has recently been on a growing trend among students at different levels. Although this experience has some positive effects on the student's life, there are some drawbacks to this. On the one hand, in order to study abroad, students must learn a new language and overcome language barriers in the new country, which is not only a very valuable experience but also helps them to develop their interpersonal skills, since they will be in touch with a new culture and contact new people in a language other than their mother tongue. Furthermore, the experience of studying overseas can be a bright spot in a student's resume and enhance their employment chances in the future. On the other hand, being away from family can be a difficult aspect for some students. When they feel the lack of family support, they may suffer from homesickness and depression which affect their performance at the university or college. Furthermore, many students decide to do not return to their own countries after graduation and that will negatively affect their countries and cause some problems such as lack of the educated young people, which they are such as a treasure for a society.

I have studied English since 2018. My first teacher calls Vinicius and isn't a native teacher. He hasn't been in EUA or England and his only experience with the language was speak with a native, but I really liked him. Two year later, I changed my engish teacher. Now, my sister teaches me and it's been working it all. As she actually lives in the USA, she has a daily contact with the native speakers. So, she can share with me all the knowledge that she's learned on the streets or in her job. Then, with my experience, I can just see positive points to have new teachers, because my current teacher is better than the last one. If, instead of the changed teachers resulted at a worse teacher for now, I think that I wouldn't share this idea. Thus, having new teachers can work if you trust at your new teacher.

Write and Improve is extremely easy to use, intuitive and suitable for every English learner. it is very inclusive because there are writings for beginners and both for intermediate and advanced. I've really appreciated the possibility to check my writings in real time to correct mistakes I made. There are different marks for different mistakes, and this is very useful. There are different kinds of mistakes: wrong words, suspicious words, that pheraps are not suitable for a certain context, and also entire sentences which seem incorrect in their costruction. Mistakes can be corrected in real time and it is possible to check writings infinite times, trying to make them better and better. In my experience it would be more useful If when the algorithm detected an incorrect sentence it also suggested how to improve it.

More and more students choose to study abroad and most of them have always great experiences. Here in Italy we name this kind of experiences "Erasmus" or "cultural exchanges." They usually last at least three months, but most times students study abroad for circa six months. Some of htem, the most motivated ones, stays outside from Italy for one year. There are a lot of advantages for those who choose to study in a foreign country: firs of all learning another language and getting to know another culture. Indeed learning a language living in a country where this language is not spoken could become quite difficult, because people haven't the chance to practise in real life. Moreover, facing with the people of the place and with their customs is really helpful to hunderstand the place's culture and allows us to come closer to the language too. Go away from home means getting older too: guys start to organize their days, to clean their rooms, to pay light, rubbish, gas and water. They eventually learn to live as adults, out of the cup of glass in which they have lived for all their lives. Erasmus is also a good opportunity to meet new people, which maybe will help in an eventual future job. However, studying abroad can also have disadvantages. We Italian people are really close to our families and their absence sometimes is so intense that someone could suffer from lollines. Moreover, In some cases, going away from home could become an excuse to run away from responsibilities and duties or to live a life out of rules. A lot of student thinks that what happens in Erasmus remains in Erasmus and they use that period just to have fun and not to study. Studying abroad could be the greatest of the experiences with the fair approach.

To my opinion, studying in another country is a very good idea. In 2016, I went to Canada for my law and history studies, it was my best experience in another country. This allows students to discover news countries, news cultures, new friends and news relationships. It is very important when we are young to understand the way of thinking for the natives. It opens our eyes ! Of course, in another country, we can learn a new language or visit some monuments. Moreover, going in another country shows you what you like and what you miss in your owner country. An example, for me, when I was in Canada, the thing that I missed the most was the bread ! Of course, my family too ! To conclude, during a trip in a foreign country, remember that the most important thing is to have fun ! It is a great experience !

Some people believe that employees work in enclosed work stations or open design stations their own have benefits and drawbacks. In this essay I am going to outline two main reasons for enclosed work stations or cubicles and open design stations. Based on my knowledge, I am going to demonstrate advantage about enclosed work stations or cubicles. If she do that kind of work stations, her employees will have more space and can put anything's they want such as some snacks, water bottles and personal things. Recently, every country have to face with Noval coronavirus, everyone has to stay distance. Enclosed work stations can easily defend that virus due to the fact that it is more distance and who has less chance to keep in touch with people. However, there are not only need space but also need fortunes to make rooms, which need air-conditionals or ventilation fans to clean the office air fresh.

Music and schools. This topic reminds me my years on high school. And to be hones I had hated music classes. However there is serious dichotomy. Don't take me wrong I really love music. I can't sing or play any isntrument but I need to listen to music every day. Still music classes had used to be torture to me. Why is that? I think that problem is that the school makes you to listen. You have to listen have to play and have to sing. This is not the proper way to approach the music. It is the same with book. I have got my own little libraryl I love to read books. But in the high school we had had the mandatory books. The word mandatory. Once something is mandatory you don't like it even if it is really great. So I would recommend voluntarily music lessons only for those kids who want to learn something more. You can't and shouldn't impose music!

In this essay, I am going to outline two main problems about all of doctors desire to working in urban areas where can make money rolling in, but in rural region there are not enough doctors. Based on my knowledge, I am going to demonstrate the difference between urban and rural region . The First thing is money due to the fact that in city center where can give you a lot of money especially a month more than $50000 dollars or more. Nevertheless, in rural areas, money is last income, so they could not spend too much on medical health. The second one is convenient, if she works at the city center, she could rely on the public transportation such as taxi, subway and city-bike. However, in the outskirts, they only can trust the tuktuk or motorbike, which are taking an ages to commute one district to another districts. And also, the motorcycle is the most dangerous things in transportation because every year in rural areas people are died by motorbike accidents. On the one hand, working hours, in the downtown, it takes only six to eight hours a day to takes duty and in hospitals where have so many sections such as morning, middle-day, night. On the other hand, in the countryside, it is so strange; consequently, it is only a doctor with two or one nurses to struggle 3 months or 6 months shift which pretty hard to control it. From my view point, the government or each medical universities / colleges responsible for branch each states. For instance, if she lives in suburb, she has better to work in suburb region hospitals. Do not give them choice. And second one, controlling amounts of salaries which can separate crowded doctors in the city center. If nurse who has one year experience, she might earn $20000 dollars a year. The third one, fixing the roads and providing subway or round district bus in the countryside that kind of things could fix not only long hours commute but also long hours duty. As, in the nutshell, that following things could fix all problems of packing doctors in the city center and every regions will be balancing.

If you want to study university you should be able to live on your own. It isn't like high school. No one cares about you and you have to study by yourself.

I am studying military university and it is really different way of life. I do not have to buy clothes or pay my flat. I am living in the baracks with the whole regiment.

I totally agree with this statement. Unless we are healthy, we don't have the opportunity to spend money. We can discuss the importance of money only under good condition. I have three reasons to support my opinions. Firstly, why money is important? We spend money to buy something. This action enriches our mind and as a result, our lives. If we are sick, we cannot fill our heart with just satisfaction. people are eager to acqire healthy body instinctively. Secondly, we try anything to earn money with healthy body. I have heard of many entrepreners who had been poor but succeeded in the end. With health and patience, it is possible for us all to be billionaires. Thirdly, if we stay health we are satisfied with our life regardless of short of money. I know it is mostly a capitalistic world, but we have the organizations which take after each other. I hope everyone in this world seek their health to live a happy and satisfying life.

Some schools oblige their students to study music and to play a musical instrument. For example, in France any student from 10 to 14 years old are taking music lessons. Other countries do not have the same politics, and doesn't seek the point to learn about music. In my opinion students should have to study music but not to learn how to play a musical instrument. Of course, studying music and learning how to play a musical instrument can help students to develop creativity and amusement. As any art, music have the power to be universal and everyone can enjoy some of it. Music can spread a message and it can be adress to anyone. Being aware of what music has to offer is very important. Learning about music will open the mind of young students, and they will discover another kind of culture, or re-enforce what they already know. There are many ways to study music as learning how to read the music or to learn about former famous singers or musicians, or even singing some songs. Some students might discover a new hobby, and as it happened to me, to study music outisde the walls of shcool. Playing a musical instrument can encounter some difficulties to organise. Most musical instruments are very expensive, and most shcools can't afford such an expense. I believe if only rich schools can make it happen it will worsen inequalities between students. Of course, if states are funding all the equipment I believe every student should learn a musical instrument. It will give them new skills and it will open their minds to art and to music culture. It is always difficult to give a sharp opinion in this kind of matters. I am only speaking with my former experience.

Some people say if you have plenty of money, you can buy anything you want. This statement is partly true, but being healthy is what you cannot buy with money. Imagine you have terminal cancer. No matter how much money you have, any treatment you can afford today may not able to cure it. For example, Steve Jobs, one of the co-founders of Apple, was extremely wealthy, but he died of pancreas cancer. Money cannot always resolve health problems. That said, being rich enables you to beef up your health. It costs you a decent amount of money to eat healthy food, to get regular check-ups, and to receive medical treatment. If you are poor, you have to work under terrible labor conditions, so even working under spiritually healthy environment calls for you being wealthy. I think that though being healthy is more important than being rich, being healthy requires being rich, at least not poor.

Some people consider that, students must study music and learn to play a musical instruments but other students do not bother to study music and musical instruments. In this essay, I am going to outline about upsides of studying music and musical instruments. Based on my knowledge, music is power and people can feel about nature with melody is the perfect one on the earth. Music could give to all individual person full of energy and strength;as a consequence, some people may say "music is part of their life." Moreover, if you are feeling alone or depressing, you can open full of energetic and lively song which can give you up. And also, some types of music like sleep or meditation songs which could calm your mind and let your hair down. Some people say that they have to sleep with music. If she sleep is without music, she could not sleep whole night because of music power. Music is key to create the whole kind of their meanings in one music, for instance, National anthems which are full of meanings include sadness, dynamic and strength. And last, but not least, music subject is desired by most people in the 21st century not only Asia but also all over the world; thus, in China and Taiwan, music subject is most hard to get into and the price is higher than others. From my view point, why do not we study music subject? If you have a free times, do not wasting and keep trying music subject which could give you more opportunities. I think all schools have better to study music due to the fact that they are going to know how beautiful the music melody and when they feel alone that can life them up. If somebody will ask me " will you study music subject?" I undoubtedly says "Yes." As, in the nutshell, that following keys are showing about why we should study music subject. " Music is love and marvellous."

Let my introduce my personal opinion. It is important to say that I am studying military university and it is a bit different education system. Our military university is part of our defence forces so it prepares soldiers for their duty. With that you are not allowed to study foreign civil university. So if you want to study abroad you had to choose some of the military schools. It is true that it can be useful to know tactics of other armies. But we are offered to study only in countries like Austria. Their armed forces are not equal to ours at all. I don't believe that Czech soldier can profit from such education. In my opinion the only reason why students want to study foreign military university is just entertiment and money. We are studying important things about our future job every day. It is based on our armed forces. You can't learn such things somewhere else and you can't catch up with the rest of the class. It is becaouse you will miss some important practical lessons.

The main reason why most doctors want to work in cities is, obviously, money. In fact, I believe that money is what makes most people do something in life. Moreover, in the countryside there is the disadvantage of only having contact with older patients that need more care and attention than younger ones. In order to improve the situation, doctors would like to be awarded with prizes, but not only monetary ones, though. Maybe, a welcoming measure would be the possibility of creating their own medical projects, even when working in these small villages.

People think that money gives happiness. I personally think that being healthy is much more valuable and important. First of all, money can buy a lot and make your life easier , but it will not buy your health. In my opinion we should be physically active as much as possible and try to find that spare 30 min for exceesice at least 3 times a week. Nowadays, processed, unhealthy food, stressful situations, pollution and busy life can affect our wellness. And money cannot change it. But we can by simply eating healthier, changing bad habits or avoiding fast foods. Personally, being healthy means much more to me than being rich. I believe that I can avoid poor health conditions by active lifestyle. To sum up, I truly believe that being healthy is more important than being rich. I personally would love to live as long as possible, to see my children and future grandchildren grow and to make memories of those priceless moments which money could not buy.

To be honest, I don't like zoos. It is because all the animals in zoos seems to be dead in their eyes. Having said that, people visiting there looks fun to meet a lot of rarely seen animals. Do you think they show us their real livelihood in the cage? Do you think we can recognize their habit, culture and favorite play in zoos? I believe lions in nature run fast, never put down on the nature field all day long. I know every animals in nature struggle to find foods, never wait to be fed. As far as we enclosure them in zoos, we never know animal's real instinct. I think we should figure out another way to meet animals. Safali park is better to meet them but they are "fed" eventually, so we can't see their "real life." If you want to learn about animals, you should go to forests or savanna and get to know they are really ferocious.

The issue of volunteer work is widely debut, with some students claiming that it is for university students or who have been had a lot of money person. However, I personally agree with this, and I will explain why in this essay. Firstly, doing volunteer work is full of benefits outweigh than disadvantage. This is not only students but also for majority which can give you about real live skills especially communication skills and socialisation. Most of the students are week in communicate skill at presentation or at the stage when they have already gained experience in volunteer which can fix panic. For instance, volunteer work, you have to go to every place such as low proverty, suburb region and countryside, where places people are being given about do and do not things in front of pack of people. That kinds of competence can fix them about their shy and panic. Some students are not good at socialization whether he lack of parents or single person must join the volunteer work where give you a lot of strengths and knowledge. That work not only can build your personal skills but also give you a sweet smiles or wishes from donatee. I do appreciate that some students think alternatively, saying that it is better to study instead of doing volunteer work. The volunteer work are only need for undergraduate or postgraduate students to get better credit scores and who have already had rich person have to do this work. As, in the nutshell, I believe that doing volunteer work life you up and get more new experience and know about how to consider other people feelings.

There is a new aptitude in the Italian schools that is becoming always more common, and this is the opportunity to study music. It should not be seen like a waste of time, but in contrast, it is supposed as a workable method to stimulate the students curiosity and their willing to deepen their knowledge in a specific topic. All of us know how young people are interested in music, but what they likely miss, is a general tuition in the history of the music and a better knowledge about some of the most famous and important compositors. An always more increasing number of schools have already decided to give lectures where students can choose what fields of the music to study. The experiments seems to work and students not only are getting high scores, but they also read up about the subjects they are more interested in. What is absolutely amazing, students often come up with new ideas regarding how to update their knowledge learnt at school. The study of the music is supposed to sharpe our sensibilty and it should make our brain more prompt and able to catch the most apparently insignificant details of an issue. This is the main reason to fight a social fenomenous of brainwash, something that is affecting students who are used to listening some music that breaks their nervous system and their logical capabilities. However this is not the only reason, I think music should be tought at school in order to wide the general culture of young people, and this is certainly something that can help to get more wise, sensitive and well educated adults.

Nowadays more and more people use electronic devices when they study. It helps them improve their learning ability and increase motivation. In my opinion, computers and tables can replace books in schools and univeristy. Firstly, children are grow up with electronic devices which become natural environment of their grow up. As a result books are for them oldfashion and boring. They want to have everything now. What's more, they hate reading. They would rather watch films on the internet than reading books. Secondly, using computers or tablets help to reduce amount of books in children's bag. What's more, this situation helps them to protect the environment by avoid deforestation. On the other hand, books help students develop their attention span. They have to focus on the topic more than 5 minutes. Next, to find true information for homework is better to use books, because on the Inetrent students can find fake news. To sum up, in the cnearfuture all schools and univeristy are able to use comuters or tablets instead of books. It is more useful, convenient and more attractive for students.

The importance of zoos are focus on several talks when environment workers are together. To the people who support the zoos in the cities, this place have a great importance to awakening human beings about their impact in the nature, because only when you know about something you can pretect it. When the zoos attract people into that, a lot of activities can happen whatever the age of the public. To the other hand, a lot of people think that the animmals must live free. In this conception, the zoos are bad places for the animmals, because there are jails very small there and it don't provide enough interaction with other species, as would happen in their natural habitats. However, I think the best way to make people become more aware about their role as a being belonging in the nature is provide fair conditions to the animmals live with freedom. For example, in the South Africa, the savanna's animmals can live free and the human beings pay to visit it in its natural habitat. This practice is called "safari" and it has been seen like a positive way to improve the human awareness about the environment.

On the other hand, my husband was living alone in another city, he grew as a person, he became more independent, learn to manage his money and to solve problems, also he usually spent his time in extracurricular activities like baseball, gym or parties. I never had time for extracurricular activities because I lost 4 hours per day travelling in a bus. Also, my mother didn't allow me to play or to have a party with my friends.

Its original comic is a bestseller because its development is very rapid, and because as the story goes on, its foreshadowing comes together elegantly. Nevertheless, the movie is good-for-nothing.

TV as one of the advanced technologies impacts our lives in several ways. The most use of this technology is for leisure since the various channels provide us with different sorts of films, cartoons, animation and news. Furthermore, some educational channels are broadcasting different courses in various aspects. Nowadays, as people get used to TV more than past, more channels with such content are becoming more popular and attracting more attention. For example, some sports channels give stretching exercises to people every morning. In addition, many programs provide basic training on various topics such as cooking, gardening, motherhood, psychology, self-improvement, and more. In my opinion, this kind of content is both entertaining and educational. Moreover, there are some special programmes that only focus on educational content. For example, there is a channel that teaches children math, chemistry, etc. every night. In conclusion, while TV has plenty of programmes to entertain people, it also has a huge potential to be an important educational station, especially during this quarantine time because of Coronavirus.

Some people believe that some university students stay with their friends or at dormitory, but others live with their own family. There are valid arguments on both sides, which I will discuss now. Based on my knowledge, living with their own family has better option which can more force on subject (Major) without concern about food, clean and so on. Most of the day have to force on the subject (Major) which can get more credits and high grade. However, the biggest downside is time management, attend the university students age are just adults (19 to 20s) which age come into own stand live and need to how to control everything such as time management, socialization, flexible living with others etc. When they get married or set up company, they do not know how to do time management. Besides that, whether live in dormitory or rent a room and share three to five friends live together are very popular in the university live at decade. Many people say that every day when have to coook, study, wash clothes and so on. It is a good time to not only study subject (Major) but also learn time management. On the other hand, it is very tough and hard to stand on own and nobody will help you. As, in the nutshell, I believe that live on own which can get better choice, stick our neck out and make us more potential to be successful person.

Education life is an essential part of everyone's life who normally start their student life since three or four years old. During those years kids usually have the same teacher since kindergarten to primary school who teaches them the basic subjects and spend most of the day with them, opposite to that in high schools, preparatories and colleges people have different teachers for each subject as a resources to teach students get used to learn no matter the teacher who is teaching. This process of teaching in high schools are good to students because they learn to learn indistinctivily to the person who teach and they just focus on the subject and knowledge behind it . To me, having different teachers each year has more benefits than having one teacher for several years because students have the opportunity to experiment with different styles of teaching during their educative process. They can also develop abilities to make investigation projects due to each teacher will ask for homework or papers with specifically points to be scored in order that each student should develop those homework with those specifications and investigate the best way to present their works with the correct toppic and framework. That's why I consider better have different teachers trhough the years instead of one teacher with the same style and the same way to work, something that many times become tedious to students.

Different teachers have different methods and style to teach concepts, so because of these defferences between the teachers, some people think that, it can be more useful for students to change their teacher every year, and try deifferent methods, but some others believe that it is not a reliable way to learn, because students will get used to their teacher's behavior and changing the teachers can caused irreparable harmness. By considering all the main points about this title, we should mention that both of these thoughts have some strengths and weakness which we interfere them in continue. In the terms of learning issues we should consider behavior of both, teachers and students, On one hand, it can be helpful for some students to have different teachers because it will help them to have varies perspective about concepts and it end up with better understanding,for example when a student want to learn verbs, a teacher may tell him/her some words that not make sense for him/her but another teacher may say this concept by a better way. On the other hand, some students are not adaptable and changing their teacher cannot be helpful because coordinating with a new method and behavior will be stiff for them, so they are not going to make a great progress. In conclusion, many different elemen have role- depends on personality and age- which people find the best way to learn concepts therefore, the main point is try to find best way without any prejudge.

I believe that men do not posses the right to be unfit. It should be duty of every single citizen to reach at least some level of physical fitness. As a scoiety we got to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the defence forces when the crisis would come. But you can't force anybody to be healthy. You can't demand hard work from lazy people. You can nurture them, but you do not control them. It is human mentality that stands against everything imposed on them. Here is the proper way to nurtue people. They have to realise that the hard work and training may be unpleasant. But it is nothing in comparison with diabetes or heart stroke. It is much easier to carry eighty kilograms instead of hundred and sixty or more. All you got to do is simply do something. Anything. And what about the idea od activities at least three times a week? It is definitely more than nothing. But it is slack. You can and you should do something every single day. Every day is new day and your body needs to get some healthy dopamins from exercise. These dopamines are much more important than those from junk food or alcohol. Dopamines reliased by working out are deserved and you can really enjoy them. The opposite option is this. Don't do anything. Just sit on your couch and wait. It won't take a long time and your culture will decay. Other culture comes and push you away. They will annihiatey your lazy and fat population. Here is one beautiful saying. The hard times produce hard men. Hard men leads to the good times. Good times produce soft men. And the soft men leads to the hard times. So stop eating your donut, throw away your milkshake and go after it.

Nowadays, so many people are obsessed with exercise, or they think that this it is the most important thing to be fit and healthy, and although I think that it is necessary too, it is not as important as other things. Firstly, whether you ask a doctor or a nutricionist, everyone knows that sport is a dependable way to keep ourselves healthy, because it prevents us from coming down with illnesses, such as obesity, cardiac problems, it helps us to make faster recoveries, it strengthen us... So it is indispensable to do exercise at least 30 minutes everyday But, however, a lot of people are wrong when they think that they only need to do that to be healthy, because there are other fundamental issues in our life that are necessary as well to be wholesome, for example, our social life, our mental health, the conditions and environment where we live.... A further point is that our diet is another super needed matter, because if you do not eat salubrious, exercise will not help you as much as it could. In conclusion, sport is an indispensable activity in our life, but there are other things that are important too and we should not understimate them.

Books and Technology In the world of today, more and more areas are taken over by technology. Now many schools and universities are thinking of replacing books by computers and tablets. Of course using a tablet instaed of a book has its advantages: Firstly, many students complain about that they have to carry so many heavy books. If they used their laptop, with everything saved on there, they wouldn't have to carry loads of books with them. Secondly, the world wide web can sometimes give more information to people, who are doing research, for expample. There is a greater variety of websites available. However, books have their advantages too. First, on the internet there are not only thrustworthy pages. Sometimes incorrect information is published. Books are witten by experts, who studied that field. Also, many people enjoy the feeling of reading a "real" book. They like to "touch" the pages. This gives them a positive feeling. To conclude, I believe that books cannot be totally replaced. They are still an important part in nearly everyone's lives. A tablet will never give you that typical book feeling, after all.

For maintaining an excellent level of health three important factors should be considered, which are as three essential edges of a triangle; Sleep, Food and Exercise. None of these three items can diminish the importance of other factors' role and influence in gaining mental and physical health. An adequate diet is an essential key to having a healthy body and mind. Since our intake food is the source of energy that our body has, following a balanced diet can affect our health in a serious way. Furthermore, if the body does not have enough time to recover, which can only be achieved with enough time of sleep, body health will be compromised. In this period of time, our body not only finds the time to release the tensions which we experienced during the day but also allows the body to perform its duty properly. On the other hand, the body needs a regular movement to keeps the percentage of body fat and energy balanced and it only can be achieved by exercising.

I think learning to speak a foreign language is less important these days than in the past except English. Besides your interest, you don't need to speak any language except English. I have two reasons which support my opinion. Firstly, English has become a global language. As everyone in this world speaks English, it's enough once you master it . You don't need to learn any other language to communicate with people. Actually when I went on a trip to Germany, whose mother toung is German, there were English everywhere. Clerks speak English and English signs are everywhere. Secondly, technology has developed rapidly. As an interpreting devices are on sale, we don't need to speak the same language to talk together. Actually, I used it sometimes and it was very useful. It didn't waste time, or wasn't stressful. I hope it is going to be more popular.

For many people music is very important part of their life. It helps them to find the best solution of the problem or is the easiest way of entertainment. In my opinion, students should learn to play musical instruemnts. Firtsly, playing on the instruments develop our brain. We are able to focus on the subcjest for a long time than somebody who never try to do it. What's more, studests became more patien and hard-wirking, because if they wanty to be master they must practise many hours a day. Secondly, study music develop general knowledge. They learn about famous composer and conductor. Furthermore, people who learn to play a musical instrument became more senistive. They know how to find balance between relax and work. On the other hand, playing on the musical instrument steal a lot of free time. Students who want to be the best need practise a long time. The don't have enough sapre time to develop their relatinship with friends. As a result they are shy and lonely. To sum up, study music is very important part of education. It open our view on the word and other people.

I think computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. I have four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, it is cheaper with long-term view. Once we get a device, it doesn't spend more money to add a new literature than a paper book. Secondly, it keeps up the tidy condition as it is new. Books are going bad, but devices doesn't get old. We don't need to re-buy them. We may spend more for an initial money, but not for a running money. Thirdly, it doesn't need a space because it's portable. We waste lots of spaces with stacked books. It's useless and dangerous. We can substitute this space for something other with a device. Lastly, it's easier to look up literature. Wherever and whenever you are, you can do that. It's very useful On the other hand, I think it is better for novels to read with paper books. It is one of the precious time to go around book shelves to find an attracting book. If you have decided which book you read, devices are better, but not, paper is valuable.

Most medical doctors prefer to work in cities than in poor and rural areas. They have more opportunities to make money in big hospitals. On the other hand, in poor and rural cities, there aren´t advanced medical test, drugs and machines. Most doctors are interested in learning how to use and apply the modern treatment and medical devices. I think they prefer to work in big cities not only for the money. The poorest people face many challenges to have access to health care. The main problem is that there aren't enough specialized doctores who work in poor and rural areas. Most countries send the younger doctors to work at poor and rural areas. If they have a patient who need specialized attention, they sent the patient to city's hospital. It is difficult for the patient to be far away their home but it is necessary. I think it is the only one way to solve this problem. The government has intervened in poor and rural areas since many years ago. To grant health services, the government has developed projects that send drugs, medical doctores, nurses and medical devices. The government intervention is necessary because private sector would never invest in those areas.

It has been suggested that some people like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old and other want to prefer a shorter life but much more intense. I personally do entirely choose calm life until 100 years old, and I will explain why in this essay. Firstly, long and calm life have to consider how to earn money because money is just like water in humankind which do not have much the person will be trouble. However, nowadays, everyone has to do a job until retirement due to everything are insisting especially household goods such as flagship performance phone, laptop and other gadgets. If he get married, his life will be perfect because two individuals person could earn money whether get children they might encourage and know about how sweet the life is. Furthermore, when they get older, do not concern about fortunes due to the fact that life insurance and elderly care are obviously coming to support even though their children have not looked back. I do appreciate that some people think differently, saying that is better to live a short life and more intense is way more to have succeeded degrees and earned money. If he does shopping, he does not need to consider pocket. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the person is thoroughly famous and successful but that person will die at 30s, the fortunes are undoubtedly going to be nationalization. The life is so meaningless and do not know about how real life is. As, in the nutshell, I do prefer to live a long, calm life until 100 years which is more meaningful and get opportunities to taste the life.

Nowadays, technology is incredibly development so young people who are familiar for technology understand easily how to use it. Furthermore, technological books are easy to bring anywhere and anytime because, if you bring only one computer or one tablet, you can read all books. And also they are not heavy. Moreover, technological books are good for environment because they don't need to cut trees. On the other hand, technological books have some disadvantages. They need electricity energy. If they don't have any charge, we can't read all books. We need to worry about charge or possible charge places. In addition, it will be happening to have them stolen in the school or break frequently. If it happens, we can't study any more. And also technological books are bad for our eyes, if we use them for a long time. Technological books have a lot of advantages. However, I think it is difficult to change for paper books to technology ones.

Technology nowadays is an essential part of everyone lives, that is the reason why education has adapted many of technological devices to teach and to replace physical resources as books or papers. People today use technology every single hour in their lives, keeping them always connected. In education, computers and tablets are good devices to use in interactive classes, but, books definitively keep being the principal information source. Of course many books are online these days turning work, homework and projects easier, however, we should maintain physical and techonological resources working together to get good projects and the teachig and learning process be developed in an efficient way. Instead of replacing books or using only technological devices, teachers and students should use both in order to get a balance between the old and the new getting tested information as well.

People in distant villages and countryside still are barred of significant health service care,on one way, doctors who had studied for a long time in search of a walfare,may avoid living in such a sectors and on the other way, it seems the governments do not have an effective plans to deal with such problems. Lack of facilities and also medical materials in the countryside might caused to occurnce of a wide variety of illnesses, therefore people who have lived in these areas -that are not a few- need to have more access to doctors, but actually doctors do not want to spend their life, away to their families,friends, and also without their hobbies and modern life. Given to issues we mentioned on the top, only the law is able to help us for solving this kind of problems. If the governments get forced to provide an appropirate walfare plan for doctors that are willing to visit patient in these areas, and consider some awards for them such as tax freedom, so these may encourage doctors to move to the countryside, at least for some days of a week.

In contemporary, many people in our society are willing to be rich than to be healthy. To be rich can be good for your environment, however rich does not invariably mean that your are healthy. There are many researches who imply that it is better to be healthy than to be rich. This essay discusses why to be healthy is more important than to be rich. Firstly, many researches show that the people who are rich value their lives less than those who are not rich. Less confident causes many health problems. For example, rich people who are less satisfied with their lives consume proportionately more alcohol and they do less activities and psorts to stay fit. There are many diseases who are coming more for rich people than less affluent people, for example, heart attack and obesity. Secondly, healthy is more important than wealth, because if you do not feel physically fit, but you have the money it would be very difficult to do each activity that you like. If you are not able to things that you like because of health problems it can cause mental problems. For example, you will estimate the value of your life less and you will be able to do activities who can weakness both your mental and physical health Another point that makes to be healthy more important to be rich is if you are healthy you are be able to become rich. turn back this is in most cases not possible or easy. There are many diseases that you cannot eradicate on your body, you have to find ways to manage the effect of those diease in your life and this can only if you conduct activities who are good your health To summarize, to be healthy is very important. If you are healthy you can do many activities who can make your life better and richer. The converse is in many cases not possible

This is an idea supposed working because it will streighten the young people's helping aptitude. I must admit I did not completely agree with this proposal but after having seen the achievements in the British schools, l changed my opinion and l am trustful that the good results can be got also in Italy. The project was initially managed by Rome-based schools that are going to give some lectures with distance learning for students who live not only in other Italian cities, but also abroad. In other words, students can decide to follow instructions from the net in order to plan their volunteer activities around their neighbourhood and get a score for all the satisfactory results; the score, over the next weeks will be computing for the final score of the degree. This kind of activities should be always promoted because many areas of our society need a consistent help to overcome their problems, but what is most important, schools should be funded by local and national government. There is already a large number of students who tried this kind of experiences, this is because they are simply invited to brush up on the notes they made. New interested students wise, what they are called to do is to read up about volunteer activities and how to deal with people in disadvantaged social and economical conditions. Contrary to popular belief, a volunteer experience is something that enreaches young and adults. In order to make the volunteer experiences as much satisfactory as possible, we need to make a precise timetable where all the activities are carefully planned. For example let students go to migrants assistance centers where they likely have the opportunity to practise their foreign language skills.

In my opinion, move alone is a hard way to become indepedent moreover, when you are in first years of college, you need some help to overcome the stress. For instance, the homework could be difficult and if you panic about that, there is nobody for tell you: "everything is righ"t or "you are the best something like that." Furthermore, if you feel bad owing of some strainger food, nobody can help you too. In fact, you can have a roommate, this is more fun than be alone and you buy just half of the factures also if you know you will have a roommate you can choose a bigger apartment. In addition, if you're bisy and your roommate is not she or he can cooks the dinner. However, stay at home with your family is a good choice too. For example, you don't have to clean an apartment or cook, you just have to focus on your studying. Besides, your parents supporte you and help you with your homework if that's not too difficult for them. So long as, you have a desk where it's calm and you have your own room. Sometimes, you don't have the money for an apartment whose next to the college moreover an apartment can be really expenssive and if you have some project get married or buy a house, you need to keep your money. At last, I think the best is have a roommate but if you are ready to live alone and you have the money for, go ! On the contrary, you are not ready at all stay with your parents and don't worry, you can exchange next year and take an apartment. Just enjoy your college years !

Most medical doctors prefer to work in cities rather than in the countryside. There are few reasons for such a situation. Firstly, career development is more possible for people who work in cities. Secondly, hospitals located in cities are far better equipped than those in rural ares, which gives medics opportunity to fully use their aptitudes and abilities. Lastly, being a doctor in a city is undoubtedly more beneficial than in the countryside. However, this generates a predicament of insufficient number of medics in rural areas and under such circumstances lives of people living in those places are endangered. One obvious solution to this problem could be an increment of doctors salaries, who work in those regions. That might be enough to convince some medics to change their workplace. Supplying hospitals with larger number of ambulances and helicopters can be another idea. That theoretically can guarantee far greater accessibility to medical healthcare for people whose lives are at risk.

Hi, Billal I went on a trip to Los Angeles with my classmates last week. We ate around and went to some tourism spots. I enjoyed the trip so much and I was so excited before that because it was my first time to set foot on the United States, and also visiting Los Angeles was a very important event for me. Let me talk a little about my family history. There was my great-grandfather in Hiroshima, Japan in the early 20th century. He decided to migrate to Los Angeles. After that, he began to run his own businesses there, which are a Japanese inn and a grocery store to sell soy sauces. He started a family, which means my grandfather was born in Los Angeles! A few years later, they came back to Hiroshima because of the World War II. Tetsuo

My one of the favorite movie which inspires me a lot is an Indian movie and its name is "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara." This film is directed by Ms. Zoya Akhtar, and she is the sister of one of the leading actors in the movie. This is a story of three childhood friends and they planned to wander Spain and organized three activities which they wanted to do. They visit various places, meet with many people, and explore the beauty of nature. The things I liked about the movie is storytelling, direction, and smoothness. It shows the importance of friends, the elegance of nature, and the joy of travelling the world.

Today zoos are an alternative wild nature for everyone. This place allows you to learn, watch and admire some of the beautiful creatures that belong to nature. Pheraps, zoos have a negative impact on animals. They are forced to leave their birthplace to be sent in these big cages. Many of us do not understand that this situation is not right for them, because you don't let them live their real life in the wild. People are so amazed by zoos that sometimes forget what is hidden behind these structures. The animals are creature that shouldn't be captured because this will ruin their normal life routine. For example, thinking that the lion, "The king of the savannah" is forced to live in this cage is so sad. A free animal whose freedom is taken away is unacceptable. But also the other species each of them with their own life styles are moved to zoos due to hunting. They are forced to sleep and then once they are awake, they see a different world. A world where they cannot hunt their prey or where the prey cannot escape from their hunters. Zoos are so uncomfortable. However, there are natural reserves, they are like zoos but without cages. Animals are free to walk in their territory, hunt and live like they were in the wild. No one gets hurt but gets protected.

Many people consider truthfulness as a very positive virtue. I also believe that, yet I dare to say that under some specific circumstances it is better to tell a lie. Firstly we need to determine why we lie. By doing so we can hide inconvienent facts about ourselves or we also can avoid being punished for things that we have done. For short amount of time lying might even be beneficial for us, however when the truth is revealed we often get much bigger predicament than we would have if we had not lied. Another consequence of lying is that people could start perceive us as dishonest and unreliable person. This obviously worsens our relationships with friends or acquintances. Last downside of not telling the truth is the fact that lies are considered as sins by our society. I see only one exception in which we are justified to tell a lie. I believe that we should not tell the truth if that only hurts other people . I can give an example of such a lie from literature. There is a book called "Kamizelka" written by Bolesław Prus. The novel depicts history of one young marriage. Sadly husband is terminally ill and he loses uncontrollably weight. His wife decides then to shorten his vest's bands in order to give him hope. To summarise, I think there are conditions under which we can lie, but normally I strongly believe that it is better to just tell the truth.

The volunteer work for high schools students would not in my honest opinion bring positive results and it even might have a negative impact on them. The main purpose of school is to teach students various subjects and prepare them for their final exams. I believe that this is a period of time in which we need to really focus on our education. From my personal experience I can tell that there are pupils who actually learn a lot on their own and who take part in many competitions, which consumes most of their free time. I am completely convinced that if volunteer work was required from them, they would become distracted and extremely tired so that they might not have achieved as much as they wanted. The second drawback of the volunteer work is the fact that it might be perceive as some kind of a duty or an errand. If something is compulsory, we usually tend not to like such thing. I think people who willingly participate in this kind of work can gain experience or help others. However if someone is not eager for such thing, then it will be only a burden for them. Additional work might also collide with extracurricural activities of some students. In such a situation they would need to resign from their interests. Some people as well consider work just as a way of earning money, therefore they have even more reasons to dislike the idea of volunteer work. To summarise, volunteer work can be beneficial for some people, but making it obligatory for everyone is pointless.

in order to develop any task humans need to gather a wide range of skills which are adopted during our lifetime, therefore, practise is completely required when it comes to adquiring abilities. It is known that the more skills that we have, the more tools to solve a problem or hard situation are available. On the one hand, my careeer is highly related to human beigns, as far as I am concerned, no matter how physically fit or strong we are, every activity we do is absolutely related to our core "computer" which is our unbelievable clever brain. What is more, the childhood and the beginning of the teenage are the most essential moments for its proper development. In addition of taking care of it by protecting from strong hits and holding an adequate diet and the right amount of sleep, there is a pattern which is crucial, it is called "mind sharp," basically means, brain training. When the first studies on this field appeared, almost every school took wonderful policies with the aim of encouraging children to take up habits which put their minds in motion. Commonly, most primary schools introduced music to their basic studies, nevertheless, some high quality learning colleges have taken up stunning activities such as theatre, philosophy, farming and so on. Believe it or not, the world of education is witnessing a revolution on the way that children are taught. Contrary to the antique beliefs of learning everything by heart, the new systems gives extreme priority to team work, leadership, entrepreneurship and critical thinking among many other skills marvellously useful for the adult lives of the future generations. To sum up, the government has endorsed these practises by raising the educational budgets looking forward to seeing the first changes in society within the next fifteen years.

After high-school graduation, students have to make choices about their studies. They need to decide what and where, they want to sutdy. In the process other choices have to be made such as: should I stay living at home while I am studying, or should I move away and live on my own ? For some, the choices is simple as their university is not close to their homes so they have to take their own appartment. Others have to decide whether or not they will move out from their parents. When students can decide they are few interogations that need to be taken into account. First: how will you pay your rent ? There are two options. Your parents will fund you, or you will have to take a part-time job to fund it. In the second scenario, students need to be aware that they will have less free time, and less time for their homework. Secondly: will I feel comfortable living on my own ? Indeed, some young students wouldn't feel able to live by their own, and still need the support of their parents. And last but not least: will it be beneficial towards my studies ? It is important to know if living on my own will be a true benefit or contreversily if it will bring difficulties. In my opinion, moving away to study can be a great opportunity, and young students will become more independent living by their own if they can manage it. Nevertheless it is important to be aware that it won't fit for all students, and everyone is different. I do not have a yes or no answer to this question.

Research recently has shown that Playing musical instruments can be considered as an effective phenomenal for people to feel more peaceful and improve their mental health. As a way to manage people to play instruments some schools start teaching music to students because in this case children get an early start in music and they will be able to show their best poteintial in music but some of school may avoid do that which it may cause about economical circumstances.

My reasons for learning English I have studied English since I was at the kindergarten. Twice a week there was a class in which a teacher taught us animals and colours. However, I do not know if I remember these from then. When I started school, my parents wanted me to learn English even though I did not like it. They used to say that it would help me later but at what? They did not say. Later on, I started to like English classes because of a teacher who made these seem funny. Only then I thought about why I should learn English. First of all, since I was a little child I wanted to travel the world so I realised that if it would ever happen I should be ready to communicate with the local people. But how could I do it if I do not know any worldwide language? That is the main reason why I decided to learn English. Another reason for learning English is the perspective of a well-paid job. Nowadays almost every employer ask you to know at least one foreign language. So it doesn't matter if you are very good at doing something if you don't know one more language besides your mother tongue. Moreover, I would love to have the chance to study abroad and that's why I must learn English. All in all, one can never know what life brings so it is better to be prepared for any opportunity one might receive.

Speaking a foreign language still important nowadays? I believe its more important than ever. In the past, speaking a foreign language it was important, especially to get a good job. However, today with the globalization, all the countries became more connected. More connection between countries means that speaking another language is relevant to work, to study or for friendship. I will explore the reasons in the essay below. First of all, in the past speaking a foreign languague was related to work. Usually people who spoken another languague worked in big companies overseas. Nowadays, even in small companies its required a second language. For example, I worked in a small company in Brazil and it was necessary speaking and writing in English. That is why the company had customers in the USA and Australia.

I believe the cultural exchange is one of the most important things we can do in life. I do not see any disadvantage if you can afford it. Maybe the only disadvantage is related to the money you should spend. Studiying in another country could be expensive, especially if you do it in a great university or high school. Apart from that, I see the exchange like an opportunity. Stay in touch with new cultures allow the student to grow as a person. Learning new languagues could be one of the most important skills you could acquire. At the end of the process you should be able to speak fluently other language. Networking effect is an advantage of the experience too. Knowing different people in different countries could be a great opportunity to increase your career.

Nowadays studying abroad has become popular among students from different levels and this kind of opportunities have pros and cons to consider. In my opinion, I agree with the idea of studying abroad because there are more pros than cons. Some of the most important cons about studying abroad are: more options to study; international students have the opportunity to progress in their studies and more job opportunities with enhanced CVs, students can also make more friends, becoming more independents and learning new languages and cultures, that is why abroad study trips or scholarships are good chances to students. On the other hand, students also have to deal with difficulties during their abroad journeys. Some of those problems are scholar places, budget, culture shock, not fluency in language, even some students have issues in return to their country and their studies there. To sum up, studying abroad is a wonderful experience in each person, but, people also consider some things before they decide to go with this kind of study adventure.

Dear sir, I heard you consider to ban the use of mobile phone on public transport and in shops and restaurant. I have to say this is a bad idea, and may cause a strike in our lovely town. Why? Due to the convenience and mulitple functions, people depend on the phone to get information, communicating with other, surfing on the internet, and so on. Although people maybe deeply adhere with the phone, even addict while sometimes checking the mobile unconsciously. It seems dangerous depends on the user how to use a tool. In fact, the tool is innocent. In addition, the mobile phone is created to improve the efficiency of communication, when sometimes need to talk or confirm with someone, for instance, you went to the shop but suddenly forgot what your family requeted you to purchase. It's easily to check the list immediately. Therefore, forbidding to use the mobile phone is definitely backset to the anterior time. I believe this is unwise and not worth for council to make the law. Furthermore, its' breaking the constitution which acclaimed to guard the people's right, such as freedom and secret talking. The council should stand with people to protect their natural right from the constitution, instead of depriving. Shame to against the superior law and neglect the opinion of public. To boil down to ban the use of mobile phone is not only against the personal will but also break the institution on our country. I sincerely recommend you to retreat this propose.

Living away on your own during school is a good way to get to know new possibilities and overcome challenges. Some students would prefer to live at home with their family while they are at school. That is why they can save money and it is more comfortable having your parents around to support you. However, I can say from my own experience that live away is the best option, if you are open to new challenges. I will explore below. I went to a university far from my hometown. Firstly, I took a bus in Vinhedo to go to Sao Paulo where my university is located. I watched the classes and then I took the bus back to Vinhedo.

I think the most effective layout in the office depends on what kind of job the workers go on. If you have to concentrate on the work in a silent space such like coding, data mining, and editing, then you require the space which is enclosed with cubicles. No one disturbing you drives your work faster than ever. Meanwhile, if your job is to create something new such as journalist, designer and advertizer, then you require the space which is no walls separating employees from their co-workers due to cooperate, discuss, and abrupt congress. Besides, you may consider the communication ability of co-workers. When many of those are hilarious and good conversation is carried on, the open space could be better for them regardless of their job type. The most important point is how much co-workers feel comfortable in the office. Moreover, the quality of business should be kept on high level.

Anyway, I have to apologize for not letting you know about it. I'd like to go to their next concert with you. By the way, their concert was amazing. I felt that they were still young.

Fans including me also responded with screaming. It was like a dream. Let's go to the next concert together. See you soon. Sincerely yours. Kazu

my experience with Write and Improve. Write and Improve is a website where you can improve your writing through exercises. these exercises will be checked for you and show where there is room for improvement. a simple concept really, but it has proven to be very successful for me; ever since I've started using Write and Improve I've improved my writing a lot, without a great deal of effort. I only wished it was a bit more organized, at first glance the website is a mess. but this is a small price to pay when using Write and Improve. you can see your progress in graph on the right, this is a great feature. sadly however, you can't scroll to previous results that don't fit in the graph. which comes as a rather significant annoyance. in spite of these flaws, the website is a real life saver. I'd recommend it to anyone hoping to improve their English.

There is no doubt these days, many addicted children at video games. The question is, is video games have a good affect on children or bad affect? In this essay I will diccuss both viows and draw my own opinion. In terms of a positive side, the video games could teach kids some skills. The main reason given to support this idea is, it can help them learn another language while playing by speaking with other players from other countries. To illutrate that, a lot of teanagers around the world enter these games online and speak with others. In other words, they have a fun study. But other said, video games have many disadvantages. Firstly, they lost their times by nothing useful, many hours for an enjoyable. socondly, sometimes there are sexy people play or they show you while you playing. Also, maybe it hurt kids eyes if they use it long time.

It is widely known that, when it comes to rural spaces, the vast majority of doctors do not desire to develop their career in such places. The reasons why it all happens are going to be pointed out below. Despite the fact that living in the countryside could be seen as a dream come true to many people, it may not be the case for someone whose career ambitions are unlimited. The thing is, living in a rural area, gives people sometimes the impression of being trapped in a small space. Besides, technology and progress, do not normally arrive on time at these places. Another issue to have under consideration, is the fact that the economic resources of people who live in rural areas are far less substantial than the ones of those who live in big cities. Nevertheless, the importance of an equal and balanced medical system, is beyond doubt. Once said that, the primary focus of any kind of government should be based on developing medical and care system of the harmest areas, by investing more money on them and turning those places into more attractive ones. Last but by no means least, improvements in rural facilities, in general, should be something to take stock of. Rural life is a luxury that must be preserved.

Opinion widely diverge about the functions of TV in the societies? whether it just has an entertainment role or it also can help governments to promote public awareness about diffrenet aspects of life. Today TV is an integral part of our life, generally people spend 2 or 3 hours a day to watch different programs, so it seems a powerful phenomenal to lead public thoughts to a certain point which if governments want to change the specific hobbits and behavior of their society then TV can be beneficial. But sometimes there are downsides to consider, in some countries where governments have control of the media, they usually use these leading power to guide people to certain points which is not exatcly helpful for people, for example when a government want to start a war the media can help it to provide public thoughts with benefits of war which assuredly it is not true. In my opinion due to era that we live, TV can play an important role to educate societies or not that it depends on what it wants to do.

Nowedays, many people want to live healthily. We have many opportunities to exercises. I realise that there are gyms or fitness clubs in almost every city. For sure, exercise is important to our health. However, there is another important thing. In my view, if we want to life healthy, we need to eat healthily. Some people forget that they need balanced diet. Our diet should include vitamins, protein and fibre. We nedd to eat many fruits and vegetables, obviously. But it doesn't mean that we are allowed to eat only salads or carrots. We only need to harmonize our meals. As I wrote prevouiusly, our meals should be well-endowed with protein, fibre and vitamins. I'm aware of that some people can't cook. But, today we can go to the reataurant and there will make an appropriate meal for us. All we need to do is to send off for it. These companies prepare our meals and even deliver it in every place we want to. It's a huge dumbing down, obviously. We have to remember that, we can't eat chunky meals. When we exercise and eat healthy, we can say we live healthily.

In my opinion, the requirement of a volunteer work experience from students who want to graduate can provide them with a good experience. I think this will benefit students in several ways. Firstly, from the humanitarian point of view, the youngsters will learn how to help others and raise their spirit of cooperation without expecting payment. Secondly, the volunteer work experience can be a bright spot in the students' CV that can be an effective factor in being accepted in a college or university. Moreover, this type of work allows them be in contact with more people with different beliefs and will teach them to behave in different situations which I think is a very precious experience. On the other hand, students maybe see the volunteer work requirement before graduation as a burden on their shoulders, but they will appreciate it when they finish it. In conclusion, it may be unfair to expect a volunteer activity as a requirement for a student who should graduate soon, but this adventure will benefit them in their future lives and careers.

It is a complicated issue because it is related to the way of thinking of each person, so, if the children play video games every day all the time, they will have a problem for interacting, learning other things even communicating. Otherwise, if the children do different activities, study, play with other children and they have schedules for video games, that is positive for them and the families can be quiet. Also, it is very important to look for the video games into for children, due they can cause unwanted behaviors. For example, my parents allowed that I played video games but always they were here with me, they played with me and guide me if it was necessary. I consider that was for me because it taught me to share, organize my time, have mental agility. However, I knew people who played video games and they are addicted them.

In the contemporary society, medical doctors have a tendency to work in urban areas, in lieu of rural areas, which leads to many problems. In this essay, the main contributors to this trend, in conjunction with some proposed solutions to tackle this issue will be discussed. Most medical doctors choose to develop their career in the cities because they believe that it will provide them with a variety of opportunities to be more successful and earn more money for life. In the rural areas, local hospitals do not have enough medical equipment, good facilities,... to help doctors improve their professional skills. The reverse situation is true to urban areas, doctors not only get access to modern medical technology but also have a special training, even studying abroad to broaden their horizons and have professional qualification. Moreover, it is undeniable that salary and rewards paid for medical doctors in the cities are usually higher than those in the countryside. Therefore, their standard of living, as well as the education, entertainment for their children, families are much better when compared with living in the rural areas. However, the rise of this issue has caused some serious drawbacks that both local authorities and government should not be ignored and co-operate together to address it. Most medical doctors leave for the cities because of chances and money, so local authorities and government should impose policies to rise salary and have more professional trains for alluring highly qualified doctors. By upgrading facilities, local authorities and government can help doctors be more confident to treat victims and still work in the rural ares. Furthermore, the government should have positive effect on the doctors' mind, which help them realize that they their mission is to rescue patients and heal their pains, irrespective of where they live. In conclusion, because of the salary and opportunities to develop, medical doctors decide to work in the urban areas. The aforementioned reasons lay an adequate foundation for more policies, more encouragement to be introduced by authorities and government to interest qualified doctors for working in rural areas.

The impact of the exercise in a healthy living is a common discussion topic in our times. The questions is, are there things more important than physical condition? If the answer is yes, what kind of things? My answer is yes. I think that mental health is more important than physical condition but both are linked. There are several aspects to cover if we want to maintain our mind in a good condition. Aspects like our family, the food we eat, our salary, the work-life balance and of course, our body. Exercise is not the only way to maintain our body healthy, we have to care other things too. To conclude, I would like to mention again the importance of the proper balance. The healthy life is a combination of a training body, peaceful mind, funny and interesting job and stable family life. If we work in all these dimensions we will enjoy a healthier life!

Nowadays more and more people choose to study English through self-study. This may be a real challenge, the experience being beyong compared to the classical form of learning, in a classroom with a teacher. The Writing part was never my strength as I often find it difficult to write a pure genuine text, but I can tell that since I have discovered the free writing tool offered by Cambrige, Write and Improve, my life radically changed! The thing about this educational website is that it is very handy, offering instant feedback of your writing. It suggests possible changes in order to get the best out of your work. Just think that you select your level in English and you are at a click distance from thousands of exam tasks. How handy is that? Undoubtedly, you are never alone.

I feel a negative impression about children playing video games. Children are addicted to the games and cannot manage their times. I often see the children who are playing games when they stay at school for study, when they have dinner with their family, and so on. They play games during midnight and they cannot get enough sleep, which may affect their health. They need to stare at the screen to play it, therefore their vision become worse. They play with their friends not physically but in a virtual world , and they don't communicate together in real world. I'm afraid that they can't get communication skills through play. Some video games are so attractive that children cannot stop playing it. They may continue to play it for a long time and get a harm effect on their physical and mental health. If they manage their time and stop to play games in a short time, it doesn't make a tremendous damage, but it is difficult especially for immature people. Adults have to manage time and money besides their children.

So I need to be capacity in the future. Finally, I guess that you readers can use this site in the same way. It is free, and it is always available for everybody.

My English teacher is my sister and a big fan of Cambridge too. So, she recommended me this website and I decided to try, because I feel that my English writing level it's not the same that my English reading and listening levels. Because of that, I need to work hard. My first text had as subtitle my opinion about zoos. As i'm a biologist, I got excited to do that. So, I tried to use advanced works, like phrasal verbs, to reach a higher level. But, instead of, I realized that this website doesn't want to order anyone, it just want to help and correct the main mistakes made by people. Weeks later, I was trying to become a habit in my routine of leaning English writing more in this website. Nowadays, once a week (every Thursday morning) I write here and send it to my teacher tell me what I need to change to write better. I recommend this website, because it gives you the subtitles to you think about it and write. Before I had difficult to find a interessing subtitle to write about, and now, I have a website that makes it for me!

In my opinion , Telivision do both entertainment as well as educate. Meanwhile everything have its specific pros and cons. A lot of scientific and education channels available for specific age group even for speciffic subjects for particular class. Firstly , I would like to discuss about some programme and TV channels which provides study materials and classes not only for remote areas eventhough matro cities. So for those student who live in villages where skilled teachers are not avaliable as much as needed while in that case student can easily learn throgh good teacher by TV classes. There are many science and mathe classes with practice of question which give real class fellings and it help to boost up students as the students who are getting education in any public school in cities. In my opinion , most of the parrents are not properly focuses their kids for language learning or we vcan say that they are not finanacialy so strong they could arrange particlar classes for their offsprings. meanwhile now a days there are so many web and telivision series to teach and strenthen different language on televisions.

The point is "salary." Doctors working in cities earn a lot but those who work in rural areas earn a few. This problem is more intricating than we think. You may think that all the doctor should take the same salary. However, the salary depends on the amount of patients. The city doctors work much harder than dispensary doctors due to the number of patients. This means city doctors earn much money than those who work in rural areas. Therefore, the point is not only "salary," but also "how busy their job is." No one can control the population, thus the solution is not easy. One of my suggestion is, implementation of "doctor helicopters." Huge hospitals are constructed near rural areas, substantial medical equipment are there, and adequate doctors are working there. Those hospitals possess some helicopters for emargency patients living in rural areas. It might be huge amount of cost to hold helicopters, however the amount of patients in collected rural areas are increased eventually. The salary would be pretty much same.

The future of travel is very near. Today transport system is very evolved. We have made a giant step since his birth. Now we have so many types of transport, such as bus, car, plane and train. Each of them are still evolving. For example we are introducing electric car, which can allow us to pollute less than before. There are also other different types of inventions. One of these could be the rise in the speed of some vehicles, like trains or cars too. Now we are thinking of another type of travel. Space travel. It will be awesome! Just think about how travelling in space can be! We will be able to see planets and stars from a very near distance, take a selfie in front of some planets, make video etc... Maybe in late 2100 we could drive a flying car, like in futuristic movies. I hope to see this type of car in my future, because I really want to know how strange driving in the air is. This method can allow us to travel country to country without taking the ship or plane. We could go from Europe to America by driving our car. Awesome! I really hope in a future like this.

It's an important statement. I already heard that many people waste their health trying to be wealthier. And after some years they spend this money trying to rescue their health. It' interesting and true. Of course we need to work being important for our society. But sometines we lose our awareness about this and work a lot trying to have more and more. So family, friends, the loved ones become less important as they should be considered. We need to be alert about this because there are many attractions but we need to think if they are really important for our happiness. So Some months ago I decided to learn more about minimalism. If our needs are less, then we need to buy less and have less money. Less money means that we don't need to work so much time and lose our health. So I think I will learn how to balance my daily life.

yeah, In my opinion for our health there two most important things. First like my teacher said is exercise. I think all people should exercise at least once a week. It could be whatever you want. Running, bicycling, fitness training, combat sports and stuff like that. It could be also at least long walk with family or friends. Something which raise your heart rate and will make you sweat. Second thing which is probably more important than exercises is diet. Nowadays people live fast, under high stress and they are no have time for preparing good and healthy meals. They grab anything on the way to work without wondering about their health. Diets of majority of people are unhealthy, without fruits, vegetables, vitamins, good carbs, fats, and proteins. People eats irregulary, very often at late nights and after that they have problems with overweight, diseases and self-acceptance. I think problem with people diets is one of the biggest in nowadys community at all.

I have watched TV since I was a child. The reason why I watch TV is enjoyable and useful for killing time. But, one day I noticed that watching TV was nothing but wasting time. When I watch TV programs, I just spend meaningless time without thinking something. I am a human being, so I have to think about something even once a day. Then, I had to change my mind about watching TV. Of course, TV gives me a lot of pleasure such as relaxing, smiling, and encouraging. Furthermore, educational programs like English, History, and Politics give me lots of useful knowledge. They are really useful for my life. I can say that they are my teachers of my life. In conclusion, I should get well along with TV. When I need to watch it, I should concentrate on the program as my studying or my pastime. When I don't need to do it, I should study at my desk.

I think it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. If we go to zoos, we can observe the lives of many species of animals directly. It's an amazing experience for young children and it may make them to notice the importance of living animals. Some children may work as biologists or veterinaries in the future. But the lives in zoos are virtual in a way. Animals in zoos don't search foods, water, and living places themselves. They eat and drink what they are given and sleep in concrete buildings. They don't search their spouses and they don't take care of their children themselves. Human make and take care of animal family. Human keep animal health at zoos. It isn't a natural way for animals. If we want to see the real animal life, we have to jump into nature, but it takes enormous time and money. Otherwise, we can feel the essense of animal life in a movie or TV video program. I think it is a better way to know the real animal life than going to zoos.

The school in the future will be different compared to right now. people learned the benefits of the home office , due to the quarantine situation, . Maybe, the school in the future will be more virtual like online classes and the students will take the exam online. However, I think this is not healthy. The role of the school is much bigger than learning math or biology. The school is like a microcosm of the world In the school, you coexist with different people, you learn how to be a citizen (or should be like this). The teaching methods are antiquated, they separate matters. Maybe, in the future, the matter can be more connected. If we can do this, as Edgar Morin dreamed, will benefit all humankind. This way, Moral and Biology will be more connected, and people will realize their role in the environment . They will understand why is it wrong to degrade the environment.

I think that zoos are good place to learn about animals for people, especially young children. There are two reasons below: Firstly, zoos offer opportunities to contact with many kinds of animals. I believe that spending time with animals has a positive impact on children's emotional development. If they did not exist, children living in a big citiy such as Tokyo, New York, and so on might not be able to see and contact with any animals in their daily life, and it might give them to a negative impact. Secondly, they have really important features such as not only an entertainment for people but also contribution of preservation of species by providing information about the lives of seveal kind of animals to some organizations. We should tell children how zoos help our society through those activities. For those reasons, zoos are good place for young children to learn about animals.

I think there are many advantages of studying abroad. First, students can get a lot of experiences which they cannot experience in their own country. They may feel culture gap when they meet the foreign culture. But they may notice that their knowledge is limited about the world. Second, students can learn the importance of diversity when they meet people with different philosophy, religion, customs, and culture. They can respect each other if they understand diversity. To understand other people is quite difficult, but young people can adopt the specific situation more easily than old people do. I think the younger, the better. The disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost of it. They need much money for their studying and living there. In addition, they have to leave their home and live themselves apart from their family members. It may cause some mental problems.

I think that threre are two advantages and one disadvantage of sutudents studying abroad during high school or university. The first advantage is that you can see several perspectives by studying abroad instead of studying in your country in your early age. It would definitely broaden your insight and the way of thinking. The second one is that having experiences might be beneficial for your career. For instance, if you wanted to tell your experiences to people who was eager to study abroad, it would be really helpful for you to recognize the differences in education between your country and the country you study. Whereas, the only disadvantage of studying abroad is that the security. If you live in a secure place such as Japan, something dangerous might happen during your stay abroad. So you should be more careful and try to be alart to protect yourself in another country.

Nowadays, there are many entertainment shows in the television. It can be good, but also can bring huge negative impacts. In spite of that, there are also communities of people say that television can also be used for educational purpose. Is that a logical statement? Well, since there are so many uneducational shows on television, it is hard to say that television can also educate. I know that there is also many educational shows, but in my country, people prefer to watch entertaining but uneducational shows. Those entertaining shows can give positive impacts if the audiens are wise. But mostly, entertaining shows are giving enormous negative impacts, especially to children and teenagers because they tend to follow what they have seen; in this case, the actors of the entertainment shows.

Actually, I was a little nervous before leaving Japan because it was my first trip abroad. Moreover, I am afraid of heights so it was like a nightmare during a four-hour-flight from Narita Airport to Guam. However, as soon as getting to the airport there, my best journey got started. All I could see there such as the Pacific Ocean, beautiful palms, local food, clean and organized hotel rooms, and kind and nice people, was amazing. I went shopping to buy something for my family and friends, hang around the island, and went to some places where Japanese soldiers were dead during World War II. I prayed for them. Anyways, these experiences were so memorable for me, I stayed there for only three days though. If my English got much better, I would definitely like to visit Guam again and communicate with local people.

Controversy over the incorporating volunteer work in high schools' reqirements registration has been continued during the past years. Some laud its benefits while others do not. In this essay I intend to argue about the subject and interefere the advantages and disadvantages. The research has recently shown teenagares who are used to working volunteer in different jobs have more responsibility to accept their role in society. As they devote some of hours in a week for sacrificing job therefore their understanding of difficult situation are increased and they have more potential to make a decision on the crises. On the other hand, some families prefer to enroll their teenagers in different classes and take the most advantages of their free times,they think young people should learn variuos skills for having more options in the future to choose. By way of conclusion I believe that, as the personalitity of teenagers can be entirely different, parents and school authorities should consider their behavior as the determiner key to help them to improve themselves and volunteer work -although is a sign of a sacrifing soul but- must not be a requirement for registration in the high school.

Learning a foreign language always was an important thing in life. Obvoiusly, in all our history people travelled a lot. Hence, they needed to know other languages. Earlier the most suitable language was Latin language. However, today most people is learning English. In that case, I honestly believed that nowadays learning to speak a foreign language is as important these days as it was in the past. Of course, nowadays people travelled around the world, they speak with people from other countries or even work with foreiginers. Therefore, they have to speak an alternative language to communicate with co-workers. What's more relevant, presently companies employ workers who know other languages despite the native one. Knowing a foreign language is very valuable these days. Without it, we can't achieve what we want for example an excellent job. Nowadays almost everything is based on knowing at least two different languages. Surly, I can't imagine not knowning another language. Knowing foreign language is such a meaningful thing these days.

As you know, exercise is the most important thing for us to keep our lives more healthy, joyful, and productive. However I think that there are more important things for our living. Here is the thing. First, establishing a good relationship with people around you, such as your falimy, colleagues, co-workers, friends, and so on, is really important. The more both of you are cooperative, the more both of you can help eatch other with anything. You can focus on what you should focus without annoying relationships. Second, you should earn money and save it as much as you can to survive through this world which is getting much harder and harder to live, which makes your life easier I think. Overall, exercise is the most important thing for us to keep our lives more healthy, joyful, and productive. However I think that there are more important things for our living, such as good relationships with people, and making and saving money.

There is no doubt, these days a lot of doctors are moving to impratent cities. The question is, what are the causes for doctors moving and how could solve this problem? In this essay I will disccuss the causes and soluotions and draw my own opinion. In termes of reasons, moving to the towns has different causes. Firstly, The significant one is less income on the countryside compared with other places. Because people who lives in those places do not have so much money then they could not pay all the bell for the doctor, a lot of them very poor without any money. Socendly, at vallages they miss improving machens which helps doctor to do their job in a perfect way. However, there are some soloutions could help. Firstly, Increas doctors salory who works in the countryside to chering them work in these places. Also, bring a teachenacal machens to their clinics. In concluson there are reason for this problem and some people said soloutions. Therefore I believe that, to encourage doctors stay and work for ever on vallages we must give them financial offerrs like free home and financial or specaial promotion.

Who does not want to have a healthy, intense life? Each individual desires and aspires to have a long, meaningful life. However, they do know how to adjust life become a beautiful and meaningful one whether it is short or long, don't they ? Let discuss this scenario. Nowadyas, the majority of people choose the same trail as others. They do not prefer to stand out, they sustain to imitate others about daily lives, they have a lack of courage in order to upgrade their lives in a different story whilst they obtian enough ability, quality to meet standard to change life. As a consequence, this causes their oddly flat lives which means there is nothing special, outstanding, remarkable and extraodinary. This is kind of peculiar for everyone. For me, the way you spend life is really vital. It would be able to turn your life into better if you actually know certain methods. In my opinion, I would say I like to spend life much more intense by doing what I want to do, being myself with no struggles, controls by anyone. I think it is a bit of challenging and problematic. I believe I still can pass those difficulties though by trying best, making progess and efforts, accumulating experience from mistakes, making preparation for the process of being successful. Addtion to this, life can be more intense and meaningful when you devote time for your close relatives, friends and your family who always be your side at all the time, who encourage and motivate you to do the best thing.

I think an office which has a more open design is more effective for workers. In addition to that it is safer for workers' health to protect the virus under this urgent situation or under coming new normal situation. I have three reasons to support my opinions of open office efficiency. Firstly, we don't have an anxiety to concentrate too much on our tasks. I mean just looking up, we can change our mind if we are in a difficult situation. It is very effective to do the work as soon as possible. Secondly, it is easy to communicate with co-workers. We don't need to hesitate to ask questions or advice. It is also effective for team building. Thirdly, it is useful to understand each other. We can see how co-workers work. Some people can steal the way which an active worker does, others can learn from negative examples. It is effective to make the performance better. Furthermore, we have to protect COVID-19 wherever we are from now on. With open offices, we can take spaces between workers. It calm us down to work in the office. In conclusion, I think that open workstations are more effective.

The Future of Travel Currently, we have a lot of options to travel all around the world. Higly-developed transportation systems such as airplane, ferry, and train makes it much easier to travel wherever we want to visit. However, the world is dramatically changing in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our activities are strictly being limited, and we have to stay home, work remotely without commuting. I imagine that this situation will make our travel experiences change in the future. For instance, it would be difficult to get a visa to travel or stay other countries because each government hesitate to approve it for preventing spreading the virus. As a result, the value of travelling another country would increase. Whereas, our trip to the major sightseeing spots could be more comfortable and enjoyable because of the decreasing of a crowd of people. Anyways, because of the coronavirus situation, the future of travel will be changed.

Hello. My name is Sam and I am 14 years old. I like playing games and every kids and people like it but some of the parents doesn't want to play games to their children. They think it is a bad habit for their child. Of course they think it isn't good for children but sometimes kids or adult need play games in their free times and parents need to watch their kids. Like how many hours he/ she plays games. Then it can be more helpful and if you can't watch your kids or you don't have free times then play your children in weekend. In weekend all the jobs and school closed. In weekend you will play or watch your kids. That's the best way to control your children. In 20th century most of the kids like to play games in their free times. I think that's right and I also plays game in weekend but if you want to play games you have to play for 2 hours or 3 hours in a weekend. Then your parents think, our child is playing games for a little bit and you have to do your school home work and your parents will say our child play games and also doing homework. After that, they will be happy and not gonna stop you playing games. That's all for my suggestion.

I think there are mostly three reasons why doctores are few in rural areas. Firstly, it is difficult to install enough equipment. I mean it's difficult to distinguish which is installed or not because predicting the patients' character is hard. Secondly, it is difficult to hire nurses and receptionists. There are not many expertised nurces and receptionists in the countryside as well as doctors. Doctors cannot open their clinic alone. Thirdly, it is difficult to gather patients. Many are elderly people in the countryside. Since they tend to have chronic diseases, they go to a big hospital in city center. That is why they have a family doctor there, it is hard to gather patients to a town clinic. Well, I think we can solve it now. We need to develop online medical care. Wherever the patients are, they can see a doctor in a city. It is beneficial for not only the elderly people in the countryside but also everyone who has sick. These are the all of my opinions. I hope everyone who need medical care can get enough treatment.

I have learnt a lot of years. I have studied at a school, in an Institute, in a University and in different skills along my life. I have known different teachers and I have had good teachers and bad teachers. I never forget and special teacher and friend for me. His name was "Txus." He was my Spanish language teacher in the Institute. He was a good teacher and finally he was my friend. He taught me a type of write my text that I have never known before. He was a friendly man with everybody. I would like to have this teacher for other years but they changed us our teachers each two years. I remember a bad teacher. His name was "Carlos." He was a friendly man but he made us a very difficult exam. I hated him but I had lucky because next year he was unemployed. I think that is good change teachers every year if it is possible because I can meet with different people and that thing is good for I build my education, but I think is a pity that I know amazing people and I must change teachers each two years and maybe I have moodie and bad teachers. This situation is that it happens to our younger son now.

In my opinion volunteer work for high school students is a good idea for various reasons. First, volunteer work enables the students to learn something about the community they are part of. This can be related to health care, culture or education. They will also learn more about the needed of elderly people who live in care homes. For instance, inhabitants of care homes need social contact and students will enable them to have social contact. Because of volunteer work, students enhance the environment that they live. For example, they enable the elderly people who have minimum social contact to revive their social life. Secondly, in many wealthy countries the government subsidies the school cost through the tax that it levies. So it is very important that student do volunteer work in attempt to support the community who finance their schools. Lastly, volunteer work enriches the social development of the student. Through volunteer work, students will come in contact with people who work in different fields or have different background.

Music class brings students fun! It also encourages them to take up music professional for their future. In general, lots of experiences provide students variety of thoughts, deep sentimentsm, and knowledge of a human being. Firstly, I think studying music is good for students, nothing bad however, it doesn't mean to force to take the music class. This is simply because some of them might prefer arts, drawing and painting rather than music. Back in the days, my high school had a mandatory class which you can choose. You could select one from arts, music and DT. I strongly recommend the students should take an experience but it should be the class which they prefer. Secondly, I would like to mention about an "experience." When I was a high school student, I didn't fancy any of those, therefore I took a music class. The class offered me to sing the Beethorven No.9 in German. It seemed to be amasingly impossible, however, we pronounciated German to as Japanese "Katakana" and accomplished it. This experience reminds me of satisfactory accomplishment. I can still sing it in German. I feel the experience makes your life confidence. Therefore, I don't think all students should have to study music, but I think they need to take something experience in their youthful days.

The best holiday I went on was the camping tour around the US national parks. It was 25 years ago, but I can still remember every scene of this tour. This tour lasted two weeks and its member came from several countries such as England, German, French, and Japan. I was only one Japanese and others came from Europe. We had to talk to each other in English and it was a hard time for me, but I did it. We visited several national parks in western part of the United States. We hiked the mountains, rode on horses, and learned about nature and wild animals at the visitor centers. We stayed at the camping site and cooked ourselves. Each of us cooked their country's meals and served each other. We enjoyed the international foods and cultures through the tour. It was amazing and interesting experiences for me. I think this holiday should make me to focus on foreign people and gave me the opportunity to join the volunteer works at foreign countries.

Learning a language can prove to be a very useful thing to do. Why do I think so? It's pretty obvious, the more languages we know the easier it becomes for us to communicate with large communities of people around the entire world. But what if I don't want any new friends? Is there any other reason why I should be eager to even start learning some brand new foreign language? If you ask me, yes there are bunch of other reasons to consider starting this amazing journey. For example you get exposed to a completely new culture and often times you fall in love with it. It shouldn't be that hard to conclude on your own, but because this argument is so obvious, a lot of people to tend to avoid it whenever they encounter this subject of learning new language. Also, being a language user can be extremely helpful when you decide that you'd like to spend your holidays abroad because let's not deceive ourselves, not everybody in this country that you want to visit, speaks English. They inhabit some country where various languages are spoken so essentially they don't see any need to study some other tongue.

Many people contend that exercising contributes to a healthy lifestyle. Still, very few of them are actually living according to these standards. Especially students. Schools are questioning whether to force their pupils to participate in sports at least three times a weak. However, is forcing children to exercise really a way to improve their lifestyles? Obviously, a daily schedule involving exercising should rather be considered as habitual. Despite this fact, it should not be forced upon students by their school to implement exercising in their schedules. This, because every individual has individual needs and therefore, it could provide complications for people who are not made to exercise so many times a week. They might suffer from health problems or are sensitive to injuries. While there is nothing wrong with encouraging pupils to live a healthy lifestyle, it could induce major health problems for those who are not strong enough to exercise at least three times a week. Secondly, forcing people to execute something they might not be interested in, has proven to be ineffective throughout history. When someone is forced to perform they will not experience any enjoyment in the particular activity. This might not need to be a problem when they are still in school, while there is no other choice than to obey. But it could lead to a life-long negative association with certain sports, which could prevent them from seeking enjoyment in exercising ever again. Automatically, this leads to a preposterous effect compared to the initial aspiration. I can honestly say, that forcing pupils to exercise is not the righteous way to achieve the aim of them living a healthy lifestyle. This could be accomplished in various ways, such as motivating them to reach a personally set aim. What might be the most important requirement is that schools should accept that not everyone is interested in accomplishing a healthy lifestyle by performing physical exercise. They should undertake nothing more than simply motivating their pupils.

There is no doubt these days, media is the important tools for governments, TV is the most important kind of media. The question is, is the television could be educate or just entertain? I will discuss both views and draw my own opinion. In terms of negative side, people said the television just for entertainment. The main reason they given is, TV could wies time for everyone even if they are enjoying through it. To illustrate that, usually media teach bad habbites like drink alcohol, smoking or take druges. In other wordes they show crimanal as a good people. However, other people against them they were optimistic about TV like every things has advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, we could take knowledgeable from channels like sciense, math, and palatics. Secondly, shows us the environment everywhere around the world, also, inside the sea. Lastly, it given a chance for everybody studies and learn new things like language or religion. In concluson, some people said we can learn a lot of new things from media, but others against them.

In my opinion, both of these choices have their positive and negative aspects. Since I have experienced both situations, I can say that living away from my family for a while, has developed my personality and it was a valuable experience for me. When I was a student in high school, I was living with my family. On that time, I was not worried about my food or my expenses at all, I knew that when I arrive home, everything is ready for me. The only thing which was expected for me was only studying. Furthermore, when I got sick, My parents were taking care of me, and I healed very soon. But when I decide to get out of my comfort zone and choose to live away from my family, I know that would be an awkward situation but it will help me to become independent. I have lived 6 years away from my family, and I have learned to manage my expenses and take care of my health and build a strong personality without my parents' help. However, I am not suggesting this way to all of the students, because it depends on the person's personality and characteristic. In conclusion, may the experience of living alone during the studying at university is hard, but I think It has this ability to pull out one person's ability and be helpful to be a more independent and responsible person.

I have been a student and I know that in that period you don't think only to study but you think to hang out with your friends, to have a good time, so it's an age which you can't appreciate the importance of studies, the importance of the school, so it's not simple at all to be a teacher. For this reason in my opinion it is good for the students to have new teachers each year, because in this way they can be more stimulated, they can learn several things, they can have different view of life from each teachers and they can also get their experience and all these things could make them better people. You have to consider that usually the students don't know what they want so to have different teachers could help them finding their road, while to have a single teacher probably if you imagine it in a long time could get boring.

Thirdly, each teacher will have their own experience to talk with the students. Thereby, the students will understand about their teacher.

Fifthly, if the students learn with new teacher each year , they will adapt quickly with new study environment. So it improves adaptive skills of students.

We know that the doctors want to get a lot of money, if they can go to big cities, with a lot of opportunities, they will go. However, the small cities and rural areas need doctors, they don't have enough doctors. I suggest that the government should make some program to give reasons to the doctors go to these places. For instance, a adicional salary or some kind of advantages, like a free house to live, or a year bônus in money. I guess that when the doctor goes to a small city or to the rural area, in a short time he will be so happy with the value the population gives to him, he is going to be interesting in continue in these places. Of course, the doctors can want to receive money, but they need to understand this kind of profession is so important for society, they must the consider some things behind the cash.

I like playing video games but I don't have enough time. My children like playing video games a lot. I think that play video games has good things and bad things. Video games are good because they can teach us a lot of things. There are a lot of types of video games. Someone are strategic video games, so we should use our brain to win a competition. Another types of video games are sports games. My younger son knows all the countries with their flags. He is only 11 years old. He sees this flags in a football video game. What is the problem with video games. In my opinion a lot of children spend many hours sitting opposite a TV playing video games. Somebody have problems to talk with people, to have friends and they often are shy. We should put a limit to the use of video games. My children play one hour in the summer season because they don't go to school. They only play video games at the weekends during the course period.

I agree with people that claim the idea that it is a good clue for students to have the same teacher for several years. The first argument I am bringing to the idea that I support i represented by the fact that the teacher that teaches a subject in the same class for several years is gets to know his pupils hnowledge of what he teaches,and this skill is gained by the time,over the teacher gets to interact with his students,over the teacher gave their students several projects,tests,homework to complete . The second argument that I am bringing to support my clue consists in the fact that the teacher that teaches in several years gets to know the level of their class that he is teaching so that he will be able to learn their pupils lessons that they do not understand or know,will be able to interact more easily with them and gives them tasks that they are going to understand and improve their school and society behaviour compared to a teacher that teaches the pupils for the first time in that year. To conclude, I would like to admit that there are more privilege for a teacher which teaches several years for a class then a teacher that teaches for a year.

I have recently discovered a new tool for English writing improvement:Write and Improve. This app was developed by Cambridge University, one of the most important study centre in the United Kingdom, where you can find some useful information to write really good texts, or simplify to prepare for Cambridge exams. You only have to log on the application, enter workbooks and choose the wiriting information you prefer to write. Then just write lots of interesting documents! On the one hand, it is helpful because it corrects your mistakes and says what you have to improve on an organized feedback. Moreover you can see your writing level on right top , and if you raise a higher category, you will get a more difficult language's level. On the other hand, although this will help you, there are some things that I would like to change: First, it could have a vocabulary book or something similar, for weak English students who want to do Cambridge exams, then writing models, to know how to do your texts, and finally more help at corrections. However, since I have known this app, I have improved much more my English level and it is awesome. In conclusion, I recommend it for all English learners because it is a useful tool to develop new abilities on essays and writings. If you use it, you will obtain amazing results!

I agree with the statement above. In my opinion health is more important than wealth. A wealth could help you very much to be healthy but if you have a very serious illness a wealth does not have any worth. Like I said if you are rich you could buy good medicines, you could go to a private hospital with the best specialists, you could eat only the best quality food and that's all could allow you to live in health and maybe longer. But in my opinion if you do not have money you could also live long in good shape. You have to care about diet and generally about your shape. Do not drink, do not smoke and stuff like that. The main problem is when you have a lot money but you are ill and doctors do not give you too many years of life. Then your wealth is nothing worth for you.

I think there are things that are more important for our health. Exercise is absolutely important, but it isn't the only way to keep our health. Eating healthy food at regular time is important. We should eat balanced meals regularly. In addition, we should control the nutrition and volume of our meals. Eating too much is bad for health. It causes high blood glucose. We have to eat determined value of calories divided to 6 times in a day to keep blood glucose value. Deep sleep for 8 hours is also important for our health. Good sleep makes our bodies healthy. In order to sleep well, we shouldn't eat anything 2 hours before going to bed. Avoid stress in daily life is more important. We need a suitable level of stress to keep our motivation in job or private lives, but an excessive level of stress may cause ill not only in our bodies but also in our mental. There are many things that are more important for our health besides exercise. But most important thing is to continue these activities every day.

If someone ever asks me which was the best holiday I have ever been on, I would definitively say that it was the one I went on last summer. To start with, on July of 2019, my family and I decided to go to the south of Spain to visit some wonderful and astonishing beaches on the seaside. We set off on July and came back on August. We felt so grateful when we arrived and saw how well-cared and gorgeous the beaches are in Spain. First of all, we checked in the hotel and unpacked, then we took notice of a lot of trips advertisements in the hotel and determined to start with a scuba diving lesson 24 miles away from the coast, it was just incredible, an unforgettable experience in which we got to see uncountable species of fish and marine life.

If my children will play video games I do not agree with this because I consider that video games does not improve his behaviour,his temper,his behaviour or his vocabulay. I consider that the video games will not improve or elvove the players,furthmore I think that video games will destroy the perspective of the world,the people and the concern about their future. Also I think that a child which don't plays video games is more is more productive,more social and more friendly with people around their instead of a child who plays video games in their free time,who gives all their attention and energy in video games and does not care attention to interaction with other people that go to the same school as his/her . I also consider that the children that do not play video games are more successfully then children that play video games because they are more concern about their life,their behaviour or their develop.

You just graduated and now the every next part of your life is to begin: university. But when it coms to the housing situation during this time, the opinions differ. Some negotiate living at home with your family is the best option, whereas others argue living on your own is the best choice possibly taken. Actually both options have their positive and negative aspects. On the one hand living on your own obviously helps becoming more confident and reliable but simultaneously responsobility increases a lot. You have to buy your own groceries, do your lawndry, tidy up, pay your bills and cook for yourself. Meanwhile you have the opportunity to do whatever you want - if it is not illegal though - and have experiences with being dependent on your own. On the other hand those responsibilities need a lot of your time, which is less while living with your family. Your mother might be very gentle and do your lawndry, cook dinner for you and iron your blouses, whereas throwing a party with your new friends could not amaze here the same way as you. As a conclusion it is important to mention, that everyone prefers a different way of living and there is nothing wrong with it at all.

There are both positive and negative effects of video games on children. A benefit of video games is training eye-hand coordination which is the basis of many jobs in children's life. Moreover, children who play video games have a better problem-solving skill as they expose to new puzzles in the games. However, the disadvantage of video games is much more than the advantage. Most families suffer from their children's inappropriate behaviour copying from a violent situation in fighting video games which are the most popular type of game. Many crimes are caused by game players who imitate game characters' harmful action. Another negative effect of video game which has a great impact on preschool children is a language problem resulted from a limited interpersonal interaction and a one-way communication between children and a video screen. It is normal to see a toddler watching Youtube clips or playing mobile phone games by himself while his parents are also using their phones separately. Moreover, it causes many long-term health problems such as near eyesight, muscle sore and constipation, and social problems. In conclusion, even though video games give children a hand skill, their disadvantages affect children's life severely. Therefore, parents must control their children's playtime to balance the benefits and the disbenefits causing by playing games.

Dear Sir or Madam, due to the latest idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport, in shops and restaurants, I am writing to you. Nowadays mobile phones are included in our daily life as well as food or clothing. The problem is that many people are being distracted by them during situations that need special attention. The amount of casualities a year caused by distraction due to a mobile phone is in fact increasingly high. Therefore I would genuinely recommend them being banned. It is not just dangerous, but our social life basically suffers a lot of the immense use. You can see families sitting at a table in a restaurant not talking to each other, while each and everyone of them is glaring at a screen in front of them. To some extent you need to have your phone with you and it is also very useful in some situations, but we all should not forget our ancestors survived without them too. Of course you can negotiat many listen to music, read or play games on their mobile phone, but to me this occurs as distracting as everything else. Anyways I should mention that my phone is used by myself very often too, but I tremendously suggest trying to enforce this ban because our social life will benefit a lot of it.

Office design Nowadays, due to the lively changes into the office workingenvironment, more and more employers get to crowd all their employees into a large room and their activity is supposed to be accomplished due to a very efficient teamwork. I believe that all this is nonesense, that this is just a myth that would cover the economy that the employer is making in renting a much cheaper space that will maximize the company's earning. I truly believe that the employees are in their right to benefit from a personal workplace, that will provide them with a quiet and private work experience that will allow them to focus better and be even more productive. Employers should take notice to the fact that a shared workplace cannot be properly aired and so respiratorical issues appear. If the place they work in was not jeopardizing their health, the expoyees would work longer and will be beneficial in the long run for the company they work for. Moreover, working separately will prevent diseases from being spread, as the workers will get less in contact with each other especially during the cold season when the flu is viral. The fewer people breathe the same air the better. In addition, claustrofobic people will feel more safe and their affection will not encounter with their work. It is proven that a better organisation brings a consistent increase in productivity. To sum up, each and every emplyee should be provided with his own place in order to focus on his work and to not jeopardize his health and the others'.

As you know, television entertains us, but can it also educate us? Of course, yes. I would like to show you why and how it educates us with three reasons. The first reason is that there are a lot of broadcasters which offer several kinds of educational programs. Some are for kids, some are for teenagers, and the others are for adults. We can learn a lot of things from these programs. The secod is that it is a good opportunity for us to watch TV programs in order to cultivate our media literacy. Unfortunately, you can find that there are horrible shows that are completely useless for the education of your kids. However, you and your kids could learn which programs are good or bad by choosing them by yourself. The third reason why and how television educates us is that watching TV shows really help you learn languages. For those reasons, I think that television can edicate us.

A zoo is where animals from around the world are kept to display to people. Animals in a zoo live in a cage that is built imitating their normal habitat to reduce their stress however it cannot entirely replace the real habitat in nature. In my opinion, people should not study animals that are kept in zoos for these reasons. First, when animals are raised in zoos, they change their behaviour to adjust to the new environment. They would normally hunt their preys or protect themselves from predators but zoos provide them with enough foods and safe places to live in comfort. For example, penguins are waiting for a zookeeper to be fed and tigers don't hunt anymore. Moreover, zoos divide each animal separately depended on its specie. Therefore, there is no interaction between different species. In nature, animals each species would form a food chain to control each other's population which cannot be formed in a zoo's environment. In conclusion, it is best to have animals roaming free. Zo is not a proper place for learning about animals.

Studying abroad have both good and bad points. Many students choose their school in a foreign country to get more opportunity to improve their knowledge and language. Furthermore, students who have graduated from high school tend to be accepted into that country's university more. They can adapt to their new environment and friends easier than students who never study abroad. On the other hand, study abroad requires more budget for living and school expense even if students get a scholarship. Moreover, some university does not accept a foreign student in the same course as its country's local student because of a language barrier. So, when students come back to their home country, some of them don't meet a job's knowledge requirement or are lack of experience from working in a local company. Therefore, every student should think carefully before they apply to the university abroad so that they would get more good experience than a disadvantage.

Travel in the future might be totally different from the travel now. We have to go somewhere during travelling. But we won't have to go anywhere in the future, we just use the internet for the virtual travelling. We recently use virtual reality. In this COVID-19 situation, most of us started to use web conference system in both jobs and privates. We don't have to travel to meet with somebody. We can connect them online. We can visit anywhere all over the world in virtual reality systems with specific goggles. Someone might say as below: We can't taste of local foods unless we don't go there. We can't smell something in the distance. We can't feel temperature and humidity of some places. But digital technology will improve rapidly. I believe we can get these feeling via the internet and we can get magnificent experience using virtual reality as we travel there. This story seems to be a dream.

Volunteer work is from great importance for our community and we could not accomplish several aims without it. Therefore I personally rate the idea of requirering a specific amount of volunteer work in order to graduate really exquisit. Those activities obviously require a lot of time but every student can help our community with volunteering and as a side effect they do good and accordingly feel good as well. Working voluntarily is also helpful with forming your character: It makes you more confident and reliable after you were given such great responsibilities. If you are used to working with volunteers you know that it is not always easy and sometimes devastating. Therefore college students are prepared for complications in their later job by gaining those experiences. furthermore universiities often want to know your extra curicculum activities as they are often required for scholarships. Therefore pupils are automatically given a better chance of achieving them. In conclusion it is very honorable to do volunteer work and as many teenagers spend a lot of time inside, it would not hurt them at all to do so.

Medical doctors' workplace After some tough years of studying in order to become a reputable doctor that not only are they make in order to achieve a better statute, but also to accomplish one's wish to live a comfortable life it is unlikely that a medical school graduate to have prospects about working in a deprived area. First and foremost, if the salary was equal for each and every health professional no matter the place he choose to work in, there would be more willing to jeopardize their social life in order to work in much havier conditions and with people poorly educated. A respectable wage is a great motivation to balance this statistic. In addition to the forementioned, the government should be looking deeply into introducing more priviledges to those heroes. Some of the doctors are urged to get to people who are further isolated, which makes a real challenge especially during cold seasons. Those doctors should be provided with transport in order to move around freely and also more furlough that will be beneficial to their mental and physical health. Moreover, they should get the best accommodation possible during their stay in the rural area in order to show how much we appreciate their daily efforts. To sum up, the sacrifices the doctors make being apart their families and an active social life should be compensated with a more attractive wage and a generous place to stay.

The School of the Future I imagine what is going on the school in this country after 10 years. Perhaps, some are different, and some are still the same. The most drastic change is the number of schools. A lot of schools will be closed due to the decline of the birthrate here. Schools will have to try hard to make kids enroll them. we can imagine that it is very competitive. However, the competition may be a good opportunity for them because it will make their qualities of education and services much better to survive it. Another difference will be brought the schools by the advancement of the information technology, such as AI, machine learning, 5G, and so on. These technologies will change how to teach, how to learn, and communications between teacher and students, or among students. Teachers have to follow the change.

In March 2015, I visited my relatives in China with my mother. It was my first time seeing them so they were very happy to see me and welcome us with a great party. I saw a different culture and lifestyle. They took me to a historical museum where I learnt more about the city's development and Chinese people's life in the past. Moreover, I went shopping in the shopping street and ate many delicious local foods and sweets which I loved so much. However, people there spoke in local Chinese that I hardly understood and almost unable to speak. It made me realize that I needed to learn about this language and practise using it more from my parents who were fluent with this language. That wonderful holiday was the best holiday of my life that I want to visit them again and spend more time there in the future.

Should people always tell the truth? Or is it sometimes acceptable to tell a lie? The first thing we need do is to ask ourselves: Is it a moral question or a social one? To begin with, we are told since our childhood to never lie. We heard: "lying is a bad thing, and you will hurt people if you do so." And so, everyone grows up believing that a liar is a terrible person. So, if we are responding this question from a moral point of views, I would say: we should never lie. Nevertheless I believe it's more complicated than white or black. Sometimes grey is the best option, and it allowds people to avoid conflicts. In my views, lying from time to time is acceptable if the purpose is noble. Sometimes a lie can be used to protect someone from being hurt and not the other way around. Actually, let's pick an example. Someone cheats on someone else. What is best thing to do ? To tell the truth and destroy everything you built ? To lie and not hurting you love one ? Of course, some people are just cowards. But it's a very difficult question to judge. Regardless this kind of interrogation, my opinion is: Hide the truth if the purpose is to avoid hurting someone. Otherwise be bold and brave and speak you mind.

What is the Future of Travel ? Will planes still be as numerous ? Will trains be able to run faster ? Will it be flying cars? Or conversely will there be no future of travel ? At first sight, there is not a concrete answer. Nevertheless if we look at the big picture we might find some responses. Not only new political ideas have emerged but people are more concerned than ever about ecology, the planete and their well-being. The traveling business is accounted for a major part of the pollution. And we also know that the earth can't take it anymore. To my views we must stop to travel the way we do. As a matter of fact, many people had access the air travel. We might see it as an improvement. It is not. We just increased the level of pollution. Twenty years from now, I believe car's ownership will drastically plunged. Public transportation will rise and develop. Finally, I trust air travel will only be used for business trips. To conclude, the future of travel needs to be more responsible and eco-friendly. It is our duty to be aware of what is coming.

University life University is the broad between adolescence and adulthood. It is up to each young person how steep is going to be his maturity. Even though most high school graduates are urged to leave home in order to get a chance for a top higher education, I do not see this compromise as a detrimental factor for their future. First and foremost, independence is a crucial life skill that should be gained as soon as possible. If a university student chose to stay at home until he graduate, he would be unlikely to move away when getting employed. This typology of young people not only will they never grow up into adults, but they will certainly not start a family in the near future. For instance, student who live on their own are thrifty and are able to keep track of their expenses. Moreover, they gained other essential life skills such as how to cook and how to benefit from scratch in order to prepare a meal. In addition to the forementioned, people who lived online during their college years are more employable, as they have experience with getting along easily with people and are brilliant problem-solvers. All the struggle with figuring out how to survive with pocket money due to a dull part-time job and a tumultous day-by-day life with their roommates paid off. To sum up, students who moved away from home will benefit the most from the college years, as they will take their life into their hands and developed themselves well enough in order to become successful adults.

Living healthily requires sacrifices, determination and concentration. From the outside it could seem the simplest thing in the world, but from the inside the truth comes out. Healthy habits are very difficult to follow and acquire. The experts tells us that we should eat vegetables and fruits, perhaps coming from biological coltures, but then we see them sponsorizing Mcdonald's. They bend their knees in front of money and so do we, normal people, who have to deal with real life problems. Buying vegetables from the farmer would be amazing, if the costs would be affordable. Junk food and snacks are extremely cheaper than healthy food and also more tempting. Olthough exercise is certainly fundamental for a healthy living, I strongly believe that eating good products it's what really makes the difference. In order to satisfy the more and more increasing demand for food, vegetables, fruits and animals are bombarded with chemicals, hormones and antibodies, to make them grow up quicker. This causes significant damage both to our body and to our digestive system. In addition to that, our lives became more sedentary, so we don't burn all the calories we eat, and more stressful, so we eat more to find consolation in food.

Teaching is an important job. Teachers are people who contribute significantly to the development of students. Some people think that it is beneficial for students to have the same teacher for many years, while others believe students will learn a lot more when they have different teachers. In my opinion, it will be better when students can learn from a variety of teachers because each teacher has his/her talent and method in teaching which directly affects the students' ability. The same teacher year over year can make students feel bored. When they are bored, students lose their interest in the lessons which affects their understanding and learning ability. As a result, students could not absorb the new knowledge and might lose their interest in going to school. Besides, if the teacher is responsible for all subjects over the years, their knowledge about the subject might not be well-researched because there a lot of things to learn. Furthermore, lessons might not be well-prepared if the teacher teaches many subjects for many years. On the other hand, students will benefit more from having different teachers each year. Each teacher has their talent and will be professional in some specific fields. Learning with these teachers helps students learn completely new things and they can be taught in some of the most understandable ways because teachers only need to focus on very narrow subjects and students. In conclusion, changing teachers every year will benefit students since they can learn comprehensively from many different teachers over the years. Eventually, students will develop and acquire their knowledge to become good people.

Two people can communicate with each other only if they speak a common language. Speaking more than one linguistics is always a benefit. This essay concludes some point of my view: in addition to everyone's first language, it is also important to learn a foreign one; why it becomes increasingly necessary and its advantages. Firstly, being fluent the same language permittes two different people to know each other by chatting . You are able to make friends with everybody of your country where all people understand perfectly what you say. But the situation will be changed if you go aboard without learning the foreign language. In that case, you will have difficulty in communicate with them, as well as them with you. Thanks to the developments of train and airplanes, everybody can travel far away from where they ligve . So , In order to be in contact with someone who comes from a different place, the knowledge of that person's linguistics is essential. Well, learning a second language enable you travel to other nation without communication problems, chatting and discuss with a foreigner, To sum up , in my personal opinion, people have more and more necessary to know at least a second language. Nowadays, we travel more often than the past, for that reason we are usually in contact with people with different culture. So , studying a foreign way of speaking is very important.

Nowadays it is undeniable that volunteer work is a useful action at the same time as a helpful work. Furthermore thousands of people need volunteers hand to have a better life, for example on school work or money problems.

Secondly, as an opposite argument, university access has been obstructed for many years for especially though exams. If school conceil add a new obligatory activity, such as a volunteer work, knowing high school learners have to prepare their future studying very hard, I could be very stressed for them pass the year through a complementary activity. Finally,volunteer work is for qualificate people in many subjects and moreover for people who are going to make their best and will enjoy. I genuinely think that only volunteer people is the people who can do those activities, so it is terrifc to include them in school program, although it must be optional, do not stress busy students.

The majority of people consider that doing exercises is important for their health and they are not wrong. However, there are other things which are as or more important than exercising. Firstly, you should eat a healthy diet. This means eating a variety of food poor in fats and sugar. Someone's diet is very important if they want to live healthily. Although a little junk food, rich in fats and sugar, from time to time does not hurt anybody, it should be eaten as rarely as possible because the carbohydrates affect the good working of human body. Secondly, it is also important to have an organised lifestyle, with eight hours of sleep and eating regularly. More organised someone's life is, healthier he is because, with a routine, the body get used with working normal and efficient. Moreover, it has been scientifically proved that emotions have a lot to do with people's health. For example, stress affects someone's liver while sadness affects humans' lungs and so on. So being happy and think positively also contributes to people's health. That is why it is important to be pleased with the things you do. In my view, exercise is important for our health but it is not the most important thing. If you are too busy or tired after a day at work it is not necessarily to exhaust yourself exercising, instead you could something that relax you and makes you happy.

Studying music Nowadays music is everywhere around us. Music not only drives people a pleasant vibe, but it also takes part in inducing concentration. Music used to be very well appreciated in the aristocratic society and if the children mastered a musical instrument it brought a distinctive honour to the family, being a trace of a high-chosen education and wealth. Why shouldn't it still be a mandatory subject at school? Music is a very fine science, as it develops the cognitive abilities. Children will develop an inner intelligence and a stronger sense of responsibility. It is proven that if a child takes up a musical instrument at an early age, he will get more shots at a tremendous grow. Studying music tenders an auspicious behaviour and elegance in gestures, essential for a young person who is looking forward to be part of a diplomatic circle and to gain a reputable statute in society. It is also well known that music offers a wide range of tremendous knowledge. For instance, it is a smooth alternation of Mathematics and Physics, as it teaches measurements and also the power and the fluctuation of the sound. As a result, it may be an excellent practical application of those school subjects, representing an entertaining way to understand them. To sum up, I do not see how sudying music would be detrimental to a young man's development, as it plays a beneficial role in gaining the skills necessary to become a respectable adult.

My favourite season of the year Every season more wonderful than the others but each special in their own particular way. From the lively spring to the cold wet winter, I like every each of them because I am looking forward to seeing how mother earth changes every year. However, I do have one favourite season and that is winter. In my country, at winter time, the temperatures are usually below 0 degrees. The weather is wet and it is snowing a lot. Sometimes the layer of snow can reach two meters height. The sun is not as brightly as it is in summer, therefore there is not much light either. Also the sun sets earlier, so the day time is shorter than the night time. Despite all the things above, winter is still my favourite season of all year. Mostly because I love the cold but I think I can dare to say that even a human being who doesn't like it could enjoy winter. In this season there are a lot of festivities and celebrations. For example on the first of December it is Romania's National Day, Christmas is also celebrated at winter time, New Year, the Valentine's Day and a lot of others lovely days. However, being out while it is snowing and trying to catch a snowflake with your tongue or in your hand compares with nothing else. All in all, these are the majority of reasons why I consider winter is the best season of all year. But, of course, the Christmas movies, which I adore, could have contributed a little to this.

Some students choose to study in a foreign country while they are still in high school or at the university. To start we will speak about the advantages of studying abroad. Then we will bring attention to the disadvantages. Finally I will give you my personal opinion on the matter. First and foremost, there are a lot of advantages for students who study in another country for a time. As a matter of fact, they will discover a lot of things such as new cultures, new habits, and new people. Some of them will learn a new language as French, English, Spanish or even Chinese. The skills they will develop abroad will be a great help for later. Furthermore students whom are studying abroad will become more independent from their parents and family. Last but not least, they will an incredible experience that will remain for the rest of their lives. At first sight, it seems there is no disadvantages of studying in a foreign country. That's not true. Some students might feel desoriented. Young students in particular when they are far from their parents. To some extent the young ones might find difficult to fit in another counrty. For instance, they can be disturbed with the local food or if they can't communicate easily. To my views, studying abroad is a personal choice, and it depends on your attitude. On the one hand, some people aren't meant to travel the worl. They feel more cofortable at home. On the other hand are driven by the need of discovering new cultures. They need to live wildly. To sum, there are great advantages to study abroad for a time during high school or university. But not everyone can suit it.

A long life Nowadays we live in a world of teribilism and unconscience. There are less wise people that it used to. Life is the most precious gift that can be received and I believe that it should be lived at the fullest, but taken in abstemious shots. First and foremost, life is more enjoyable when you enjoy each and every small moment of happiness it offers. It is proven that if we live our life sober, we are more likely to live longer and to get more time to have it all. A live spent in peace and in harmony is something that many wish for, but few people actually achieve this spiritual fulfilling. If you had a lovely family and a decent income, why would you work your fingers to the bone for more revnues? Money cannot buy joy. In addition to the forementioned, an intense life is a tumultous life that is very likely to end up earlier and worse. For instance, it is a pity how many rebellious young people die in car crashes due to their love for high speeding. Moreover, an exhausting career and countless white nights will be detrimental to one's health and will only bring pain and suffrance. Life is more precious than to be lived like that. Consequently, a busy schedule also neglects the family like, tremendous moments that are irreversible. To sum up, the biggest achievement in life is to be at peace at the end of it, build memories to be remembered and to avoid as much as possible the self-harm caused by vices.

Learning a new language today is not important as it was years ago. The main reason is that the rich and important people could have the opportunity to study that language, there were also a few people who talked different languages. Today it is different, everyone of us can learn a foreign language. Sometimes we need to learn it because today there are so many jobs and people who require a knowledge of the language. There are so many different people in the world and this allows us to speak another language to let us understand by people from another country. This opens so many paths to you. You can do a job that a person who does not have the knowledge cannot do, or you could simply say " I can speak another language." That is a good thing.

For example the worst marks I have are in Chinese, in fact my teacher is still trying to improve my level of the language. I am not interested in Chinese, but I need to get good marks or I could fail it, and I really do not want it. Another difficult area where I have a low marks is English Literature because I deeply hate the various poems, novels and so on. I need to get better in these two areas, and for doing this I must study them. In Chinese I need to add to the list, watching series with subtitles. I hope I will improve.

Regarding the recent discussion about the suggestion to force children to do sporting activities at least three times per week, I decided to list my arguments for each side. This could help me to conclude which side of the argumentation I agree with. Based on several studies which prove that activities can improve the health constitution of children, many teachers and scientists propose more physical education for children. Further research has also shown the obesity rate of children to increase. This problem might be dealt with by forcing children to do more sport. In return this could help them to lose weight, but also to gain an interest in sports. Without being forced to do sport these children might have never discovered their interest and as a result more young people will enter a sports team to pursuit the desire of sport. But of course there are also other arguments which refute this idea. The main contradiction for many people is the idea to force children. Compulsion can never be a useful way to convince children, who need to be taught the valuable good of liberty. Even our constitution enshrines the moral value of freedom. Therefore children cannot be forced to do more sport only due to the fact this will improve their health. As humans are not allowed to constrain each other, everyone needs to discover the importance of sport for himself. Furthermore experts are afraid of the mental consequences for children, who were forced to do sports although they avoided it previously. There is a variety of reasons why children are not confident with their body such as the shame of obesity. In conclusion I would recommend the executives to avoid forcing children to to anything as this will only cause more harm. Of course sport is really important as it can improve the fitness, but this needs to be something the children decide for because they appreciate it.

Telling the truth Nowadays honesty is a character trait that is about to become extinct, as it is more and more difficult to find people you can trust and be around people who are pursuing their own interest. I believe that being faithful in crucial moments., but there are some times when truth should be covered. First and foremost, sometimes the truth can be inimaginably painful and it is best to protect the vurnerable ones, especially if they have a weak heart. For instance, if an elderly person hadn't know about one of their children's illness or worse, of an eventual decease, tthey would not have a premature end caused by depression or other condtions, as we never know how they would react to eventful times. On the contrary, in good times old people value honesty and feel disrespected if someone tells them white lies. In addition to the forementioned, it is well known that a child should be raised a man of his word and learn about loyalty to others. But, there are times when avoiding the truth may save relationships. As a relevant example, when a child does not mention his fights he had at school without anyone getting harmed, his mother will not punish him from drawing until midnight and will not compromise his will to pursue this passions. Moreover, the atmosphere in their home will be furthermore pleasant and loving, advisable for a child to grow up naturally. To sum up, I believe that being honest is a rare gem that should be appreciated more in others, but it should also be taken into consideration the eventuality of hurting others by making them face the cruel truth.

Dear Billal, How are you ? I am in a great shape ! I want to tell you about my last week, it was one of me best experience. I am just back from an amazing trip with some students from my class. First and foremost, I discovered we have stunning places just near to our place. We were in the countryside of Masillia. It's called the Verdon. Do you know about it ? There are large rivers and authentic housses. At first sight, it doesn't seem so exciting. Rather the opposite, for crying out loud ! We visited some caves that you can only be joined with a kayak. My arms were tiresome but the landscape's view worth any effort. Moreover, I get to know the other students and there are very kind and nice. I enjoyed this trip because everything was just perfect. From the places we had been to the people I had to spend time with. Furthermore we played a lot of games, and you know how much I love it. In the future, I hope we will have the opportunity to travel together soon enough ! Looking forward to see you ! Best regards, Lola

I guess it is very important to have a life period as a volunteer work. In my opinion all the schools and universities should create requirement in this way. First of all, it is good for the society, for people that can be helped in a volunteer program. Second, a person who works like a volunteer will increase your value, as a good person, a great man or woman. Third, a young will be interested to be helpful, to work, to help someone, and will prepare him to the market work, to a job, to work in a group with a goal, to have a personal objective. The volunteer work can be especially important if you can work with different people, to different people, maybe in a different country, in a different society. It will be a cultural trip, a humanity trip and you will become a better person in rest of your life.

In my opinion there are two sides of vidoe games and they impact on young people. Playing video games by children have some positive effects on them. First of all it improves their reflex and concentration. It may help them in the future in other actions in real life. For example in some sports reflex is very important to winning games or fights. I see also another positive effect of video games. Especially nowadays where huge part of communication has place on the Internet, children can talk to each other during playing video games. On the other hand I see much negative affects of video games. First of all, playing for many hours every day makes children obese, damage their vision and backbone because they are sitting of course during that. Because of that they do not play any sport or something like that. They can't talk in real life and in adult life they have a problem with communication and things like that.

Good morning, I am writing to in case of your future decision about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In my opinion decision like this is too restictive for people living in our town. I think this decision is also bad for many reasons. First of all, especially nowadys mobile phones are not only use for calling and messaging. For many people mobile phone is used as a calendar, notebook, calculator and stuff like that. Thanks to the Internet they can also check for example bus departures or shops opening hours. On public transport people like to relax and doing things which can help them to kill the time. In their mobile phone they can read newses, listen to music, read books, play vidoe games and many other things. So that is the next good example in my opinion. Let's see the shops. There are many reasons for you need to use your mobile phone there. Many people have a shopping list in their mobile phones. If you do not have the shopping list you may forget something. If you forget something you have to maybe call somebody who remind you about it. Next place is restaurant. I think there using mobile phone is not necessary but there is a group of people who need to be always in touch. I think my arguments are strong and you will change your decision quickly. Best regards. Pat

Living is a privilege not everyone is completely aware of, in spite of this awareness, everyone wants to live up to the fullest. The question is, what way is the right way to live your life. Therefore the next question arises: A long life until 100 years old or a shorter life but much more intense. For me the answer is obvious, as I chose my goals from very early on. I want to achieve something that stays ,after I no longer live. Subsequently the more time I have, the higher is the chance of accomplishing it. 100 years is a tremendously long period of time and the chances of getting ill at some point of this, are comparatively high, why you should always treat your body the best possible way. You can, subsequently, use those years effectively for accomplishing your goals. Another reason for choosing the longer period of time, is the history you have, as nearly no one gets that old, you have a lot to tell and to experience in the first place of course. Imagine what genuinely wonderful experiences you can gain in this long period of time. There, indeed, could not be anything more fulfilling than love. Moreovere, exquisit things are to be explored, memories to be made and stories to be told. In conclusion, regard the shorter life, there are reasons for choosing this one two, but those for the longer one overweight by far.

Which is the best for students to have the same teacher for several years or to have new teachers each year? This question sometimes has debated in people who are engaging in Education. Both sides have benefits, but I believe that it is good for almost all students to have new teachers each year. In real life, we met a lot of different people, and they have varieties of backgrounds. Children have to learn about dealing with different people through school life. Having new teachers each year can help students learn about dealing with unfamiliar people and handling change. Hiroki Murakami, who is my coworker, was born in the countryside, and there is only one small elementary school where the number of teachers was limited. Therefore, he never experienced changing teachers in elementary school. After entering middle school, he experienced to have new teachers each year. He said that it was frustrated at first because he had to remember new teachers' characters and their routines, but he learned about dealing with new people through that experience. His world might be more small one if not experienced it. Having new teachers each year has more benefits to touch various ideas from different people. It is comfortable to spend time with the same members, such as familiar friends and adults who you like. It sometimes leads to close their world in a small society. Getting new teachers can help students touch new ideas and make their world broaden. Students can learn how to deal with others in a community by going to school. Having many teachers can help them experience to develop the flexibility to others and changes. Therefore, it is useful for them to have new teachers every year.

Many problems are related with doctors and the healtcare. But this problem is not just about the doctors, because it includes many other jobs. People in general want to work in the bigger cities not just because the money but also because many opportunities which are not in the viligges or rural areas. For instance in Czech republic there are the lack of doctors in these places even when the doctors could get bigger salary there. It is in my opinion about the lucrativite living in the city. Even if there were more money in those areas the doctors would not go there. And in the big hospital you can see much more interesting medical cases than anywhere else. The solution to this problem is hard to find but I would say, that there are two things which could make this situation much better. The first thing is to speak with the young doctors and try to convince them, that the living in rural areas has a good sight. The other solution could be building small hospitals in those areas and try to get the doctors there. It would surely help everyone because it is better to have a good net of the healthcare in your country for every patient.

School is a place where kids can learn new concepts, make new friends, fall in love, find their calling and I'm positive that there must be even more possibilities and opportunities for them to gain while they are considered to be enrolled in one of these institutions. However, modern schools are bombarded with lots of critique and nasty remarks. People don't like how children are being taught. Instead of teaching them by showing them how something works, teachers choose to expect their students to know only theory and the best part is that committing a mistake is something that is regarded as a stupidity. But to be honest, all of us know that making mistakes, enables us to learn new things better because we are aware of what we've done wrong. But let's move on to talking about how schools will be different in the future. So, in my opinion they're gonna be more about teaching kids by practicing a given skill. Lessons will be fulfilled with various experiments, mistakes are going to be thought as priceless opportunities to sharp your knowledge. I'm sure that class are gonna be much more smaller, because as we all well know, it's difficult to teach a group of 30 kids on your own without aid of any kind. It all sounds magical and almost unrealistic but let's not get so cozy about this thought. Schools cannot change completely, there are some aspects that are irrevocable. For example there is a huge possibility that children will still have to learn until they reach the age of 18 years old. It doesn't sound that awfully, does it? Well not, but some kids could move on a much more quicker pace and by setting this bars so high, we only slow them down. There still will be teachers who hate their jobs and try to make their pupils' lives miserable. I'm sorry that it was a wrong choice but it doesn't give you any permission to hurt innocent children with your harsh comments and your general gloomy well-being, which doesn't motivate them to even come to school in the first place!

Dear council, your latest idea of banning mobile phones in public areas has caused many discussions. Many people , including me, are worried to miss important messages or calls. Especially if your bus is running late and you have no chance to inform your waiting friends, because it is not allwed to take out the phone in public transport. Many of our citizens have a very busy workday and need their lunchbreak to make a phone call. This would not be possible, if they were in a restaurant or the bus. I do also love to sit in a local cafe and have a phone call with my family members which I cannot see every day. However, I do really like the idea of putting my phone away when I meet friends for dinner. Me and everyone else should be encouraged to talk face to face with others while having a meal in our local restaurants. My solution would be to still allow mobile phones in public transport and shops. People want to be up to date and chat with other while they take their tram home. What we could try is to ban the mobile phones in restaurants and bars. It would be amazing to see how groups of peolpe start to talk more and make new friends. There is always to chance to go outside to quickly call a friend, if it is really urgent.

I would like to say that the volunteer work is really helpful and people should do it in general. The important question is whether the schools should require it from their students. To put it another way this work is called a volunteer work which means that the people should not be forced to do it. In other words the students should decide themselves whether they want to help someone without the pressure from the school. In my opinion are people who are forced to do something not really happy and they don't do it properly. I am convinced that the schools should support their students to participate on these types of volunteer work and they should probably have some benefits for the student who actually do that. All things considered, the students shouldn't be forced to any kind of work. However they should be supported in every helpful activities which they decide to do.

Working in an office means, for most people, stability. This is certainly due to a defined working hours and to a long-term planning of activities, both personal and of the workteam, both on the side, as the projects to be completed, and on the private side, as the vacation period. Moreover, a job office offers the chance to have a personal space which no one else is allowed to touch: a desk. Having a private desk, where we can organize documents and files as we think is best, can really make the difference on our productivity. However, there are many different types of desks. In some offices, employees work in cubicles, with empty walls and no possibility of personalizing their workstations, neither by attaching photos to the walls nor by placing small plants on their desks. This denied personalization could have negative effects on employee productivity: they are supposed to spend all their work time sitting alone, in front of the computer, avoiding any human interaction. In this way workers are isolated from each other and can neither exchange their ideas nor have a word to break the routine. On the opposite, an open space allows emplyees to talk to each other and to act like a group, escaping the isolation cubicles would force them into. In this way, the job gets to be more dynamic and ideas can develop easier. If workers had the opportunity to personalize their desks too, their productivity would be, without any doubt, much bigger, because they would work in a place they feel hoomy.

Dear Sir or Madam of our town council, I am writing to you this letter regard your idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport. I am a citizen of the city and would like to tell you my opinion according to this issue. First of all, I would like to tell you that I may understand why you want to ban the mobile phones. A lot of accidents, which have happened, happened because people have used their mobile phones in the traffic and for sure: that is danger. In accordance with the number of accidents, I would counsel you to ban it. Nevertheless we cannot disregard other aspects. As you know, mobile phones have become pretty important in the last decade. There is a great digitalization and meanwhile you could do almost everything on the internet. Do not forget that there are people who are buying their tickets in an online-shop. These tickets are not printed. At least in that part mobile phones are not only useful but necessary. Moreover, a lot of people hear music during the wait-time for their transport or in the transport. As I said in the beginning, it may be dangerous but I think instead of banning mobile phones, it might be better to invest in warnings because through banning you limit the freedom of the people. It is the same in restaurants and shops. It is a restriction which is not necessary and will annoy the people. So I would like to ask that you just leave it. Kind regards, Anna

Globalization has, as inevitable consequences, the increasing of the population in the cities - especially in the city centres - and the decreasing of the number of people who live in rural areas. Theese two factors inevitably led to a greater concentrarion of the services -including those considered basic necessities- in the cities. As always happens, everyone has taken advantage of this to their advantage, even doctors, who are supposed to be charitable and selfless people. Conversely, most of them have revealed to be much more interested in money and success than in people's health. First of all, doctors shouldn't be allowed to gain all the money they gain, because they are supposed to do their job because of a vocation they have inside them. Secondly, they shouldn't be allowed to have three, four or five jobs in different structures, a solution which would also solving part of the disocupation problem. Third, they shouldn't be able to make private visits in public hospital. Here, in Italy, this process is called "intramenia." On the other hand, the problem of fewer and fewer people in rural zones should be solved with restocking campaigns. It's obvious that in a village with three or four inhabitants a doctor can't stay everyday: it would be a waste of public money, which we really need to save and spend accurately.

To begin with, zoos had become very popular those last decades. It allows people to learn about animals. It is a popular place for family to spend some quality time. However, some people trust it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. In the first place I will tell you why zoos are important. Then I will explain why I believe zoos are not good for animals. Finally I will give you my opinion about the future. To star, zoos are not only created in order to entertain people. As a matter of fact, most zoos helps to prevent extinction of endanger species. For instance, just a few black pandas still live wildly so zoos have the duty to develop the panda's population. How sad it would be if pandas disappeared, for crying out loud ! Of course, humans are responsible for the animals missing but some zoos are trying to make it better. Furthermore, zoos allows people to discover animals and to learn more about them. In this way, I trust zoos are good places. On the other hand, I believe zoos are terrible for the animal's health. I believe, it is wrong to keep a wild animal lock down into a small square. As an example, tigers need to run one hundred miles a day. How is it possible in a zoo ? Moreover, I think animals in zoos are unhappy and some might even suffer from depression. The scoring system for mortality and foot pad lesions indicates whether a good level of animal welfare is reached. To my views, zoos are a dangerous place for animals and their well-being. Unfortunately, it became an urge to increase endanger specie's population and nowadays, zoos only are able to prevent some mass extenction. In the future, I hope we would find a way to live peacefully without destroying animal's homes.

Music is a part of art and I believe that all people should know some basics about the music. The important question is whether it should be taught in schools. Firstly, music is part of our lives. We are in touch with music every day in movies, shows, many people are listening to music in their free time and some people are going to concerts. If the music is really that important in our culture we all ought to known something about it. Secondly, the music is also important for our thinking and mindse. On the other hand there are people who do not like the music at all and they are bad at it. For example one of my friend was forced to play piano and he didn't like it at all. All things considered it seems to me that the students should be educated in the theory of music but they shouldn't be forced to play any music instrument.

My reasons for learning English There are many reasons to learn English, and everyone might have a different point of view. To begin with, I will give you the reasons that led me to learn English a few years ago. Additionnaly, I will tell you why it matters to me. To start with, I wasn't very interested in learning English when I was younger. I believed it was useless. At the age of fifteen I changed my mind for crying out loud ! The main reason to learn English was to be able to watch American's movie in their original version. As a matter of fact, I was a huge fan of Buffy, the vampire slayer and it was important to me to hear their voice without coverage. Of course, I used subtitles. Furthermore when I arrived in college, I had to take English classes. It made me understand how necessary it was to improve my writing and speaking ability. Not only to be able to graduate but also because a lot of campagnies value it. Last but not least, I love to travel, and I am very interested in learning about other countries. To speak English offers me the opportunity to communicate easily with foreigners.

Today knowing English is crucial for any worker. So it's why I am studying English. All articles and manuals are in English. Some of them are in my native language. With the globalization, we need to work with foreign professionals. So how are we going to communicate if we don't speak English. Many times they aren't native spoken English, many of them are Chinese, Germans, Spanish, so it's important to have a language in commom. This language is English. If I am not wrong, there are more English speaker who are non-native than native English speaker. Of course, if you work in some rare areas that other languages are not important, so it's not important to learn. But if you are in this situation and like to travel abroad, so knowing English is very important. Travelling companies always have instructions in English. So if you wouldn't like to stay behind, study English!

Hello Anna, How do you do! Five days ago I went to an absolute incredible concert, it was really mind-blowing to listening to the six musicians, all the other people around me and last but not least the awesome fireworks at the beginning and at the end of the concert. Since I was a teenager I've dreamed go to other concerct of the Scorpions, yes this wonderful German boygroup that plays German and English spoken songs. Despite of I didn't get some English songs, it was a pretty amazing night. If I had learnt more English vocabulary, I would have understood more.

Hi friend! How are things? Sorry to be so slow getting back to you but as I told you some weak ago, I've been to an incredible concert in the city next to mine. I'm glad that you dropped me a line. So, in your letter you wonder about how that came. Well, my girlfriend's really keen on music, so she persuaded me to go with her to a concert that was taking place in the city next to ours, and although I had to work that day, I couldn't call it off because she already bought the tickets. She's infatuated about a lateen singer called Bad Bunny and when she heard about the concert, she freaked out. I'm not fond for Spanish music, tough although that, I enjoyed the concert pretty much. The atmosphere was really cozy and cool, there were many fewer people than I expected, so it wasn't too crowded, which was something I felt really thankful for, and despite the event lasted 3 hours, surprisingly, I ended up singing and dancing as if that was our last day on earth. The guy performing was wearing flashy fashionable clothes so it wasn't easy to lose him. Well, that was all for now. I'm looking forward to hearing about your weekend. Best wishes, Ale

Without goes saying that the use of cell phones is, and is being enough common in the nowadays, after all, we watch films, series, read newpapers, book; seeing that this is a great way to connect with the breaking news. However, there is an addiction to mobile phones in the these days, though the resolution is not to ban this device. Whereas that measure is not going to reduce the problem of interaction between individuos, apart from interfering in humanitarian law, as it interferes with citizens' right to choose. Let us focus, firstly, on such idea as to prohibit a mobile telephone can be seen as an answer to the question of social interection in establisment as restaurants, stores, or even in public transport. Although this notion is well accepted to majority of people, it is incorrect, considering that this issue is multifactorial; consequently to ban only an idea will not settle the problem. A good illustration of this is to note that there is a huge diversity of relationships connected over the Internet. On the other hand, all person must have the right to take their own decisions and do their choices, forasmuch the democratic country must not impose laws that interfere in the options of a population. In other words, it is crucial that citizens go to public places in the way that they have selected and with the devices that this individual considered the most appropriate. Nevertheless, I disagree with radical options for minor problems, since cell phones have more pros than cons and, therefore, it is better to have it than not to have it. Only understanding that a phone allows contact with the world.

I think that telling a lie is a very big mistake. If you respect somebody you should tell him or her the truth, telling a lie is not going to solve your problems, sooner or later they will find out that you have lied and they will never trust you again. After telling a lie you are forced to say another lie and another lie, until you start to believe your own lies. I don't like to lie to my son, wife or mother, is not fair for anybody. I remember that sometimes my father was telling us lies and that was pretty obvious, when you are lying your body is still telling the truth. Grown ups usually know when you are telling a lie, is easier when you have to lie to your children or your grandfater in order to protect them, that is not a good strategy either. Children learn this way that it's right to tell a lie in order to get out of a difficult situation. I like and I search for people that doesn't tell lies, I want to be able to count on them and being a liar is not a person who I can trust. Regarding this subject I think that I have nothing else to add, I am looking forward to go to sleep.

If we want to discovery how will be the future, a good way to start this it's searching for the past. In 60th decade, travelling around the world was a utopian dream. There was a few flights and they were very expensive. Therefore, the knowledge about the universal language (English) didn't be a commum practice in schools around the world. However, with the power of globalization, travelling to several countries in the same life became a possible dream. The amount of flights increased - side by side with your market demands - and the traveling culture has been spread as a new hobbiy and a synonymous of happiness. Finally, we arrived to the 21st century and we wondering: in the next years, will I traveling more? It will become cheaper? The answer, for me, it is all yes. In an increasingly connected world, the boders will decrease. On the other hand, I'm scary about the loss of culture shock between countries. First of all, we need put in our bags just the wills and leaving at home the colonizing instinct that unfortunately still lives in our society.

When I was a child at school, during the music class, we learnt songs to sing at the end-year concert. It was fun, because our teachers taught us new words and ballets. When we grew up, sometimes we happened to sing musical songs, with solo parts: there were auditions to assign roles. Once I won and I became the protagonist: I was the happiest child in the world. When I was a girl, at the secondary school, during the music class we listened to classical music, as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach or Puccini, and we studied the history of the operas, as the Aida, the Traviata or the Turandot. We also studied how to play melodies with the flauto, as "jingle balls" or "alleluia alleluia." Oltough studying music was funny when I was a child, when I grew up it became a complete waste of time. My teacher didn't take his job seriously and most of the time we wasted lessons talking about other things or studying other subjects. The hours used to study music can be useful when children are still little, because they need to have fun and to understand which are their interests. When children grow up, time should be spent in better ways. For example in schools could be introduced again the study of our Costituzione, whose articles should be known by every Italian citizen, or civic education, whose knowledge is really missing, because people have lost their good common sense. Moreover, it could be developed geography taughts, because people, especially the young ones, ignore what they are surraunded about. They don't know neither that Rome is our capital, nor that Pisa has the Leaning Tower, nor that Po, Arno and Tevere are our biggest rivers.

As far as I am concerned there is something essential about benevolent work at all. So as for me, it ought to be a part of compulstory curriculum, an obligation to finish school and get the report. Some people could take it strange to force young pupils to go for something like that as a part of their education. But why not?? Education isn't purely something professional it should prepare youngster not only for work to get good money but mainly to be a good person - sensitive and eager to support others. Unfortunately hospitals are crowded with suffering people waiting for someone to bring them relief. Moreover kennels are full of adorable animals craving for a warm smile. Place like that require some backing especially young, strength and healthy people who can provide those in need with their care and helping hand. If schools did something like that habitually they could contribute to students' personal and mental development. It could be quite educational as well as benecitial for future life. For example how to take care of ageing parents or be patient with children. Adulthood isn't only about making money and leading luxury glamourous life. It brings also: suffering, afflictions, misfortunes and hardship as well as responsibilities. The soonner young people understand that the better. Experience like that could not only evoke the drive to do something unselfish, but also ecourage to be diligent and make some sacrefices in order to make others happy unpaid.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am Mike Smith, a citizen in this town. I would like to tell you my opinion about the idea of restriction of mobile phone usage in public spaces. In my opinion, it is not a good idea. If the usage were actually banned, it would result in being criticized by a lot of people. There are three reasons why I oppose this idea. First, we cannot respond e-mails or phone calls quickly. Although some people have bad manners, it is too severe that you prohibit us from using phones in public places. Most of us usually interact with others anywhere. For example, I send an e-mail to my friends on the train when I make appointment with them. I have to tell them when I arrive at the place where we gather. Moreover, when I receive e-mails from my business partners, I will intend to respond them as quickly as possible, in order to ensure our relationships. Second, we enjoy sharing our experience with others on time. We often take photographs of our lunch. If it were restricted, some people avoid visiting shops and restaurants in our town. It might damage their sales. Third, it is harmful for our rights to prohibit us from using our own mobile phones. It depends on our free will whether we use mobile phones anywhere. It is not desirable for our town's council to be criticized for human rights violation. After all, I oppose the idea from the reasons above. Yours faithfully, Mike Smith

Some people think that being honest in all situation is an important moral virtue. In my opinion, while telling the truth is an important thing in life, telling some lies in some crucial situation is acceptable. The importance of honesty can be demonstrated for a variety of reasons. Firstly, honesty develops a position of trust between us and others, which not only build a strong bond between us but also fosters our self-confidence. Secondly, when we learn not to lie to others, they recognize us as an honest person and will respond to us with the same attitude. Furthermore, building relationships based on lies will always give us a high level of stress from exposing the lies we tell. On the other hand, sometimes honesty hurts more than it helps. In some dangerous or emergency situations telling the truth does not make sense and can even have a bad effect on the other person. For example,if someone has a heart problem and asks us about the truth about some of the bad things that have happened to his or her family, it is not right to tell him or her the truth. More than that, in some circumstances, when we should not give information about one person status who is in danger, telling lies would be valuable and even will save his/her life. Thus, while the importance of honesty should not be underestimated, sometimes lies have a significant impact on a person's life or security.

On many schools, children learn how to write an essay, how to solve a mathematical problem and many other important subjects. All these subjects are meant to impart the children the skills and the knowledge that they need for their foreseeable future and education. For some children, it also helps to determine their hobbies. The questions is, why can music be a part of school curriculum? I believe that studying music supplies many advantages for children. In this essay, I will provide evidence that endorse studying music at school. Firstly, studying music at school allows children to discover their musical talents. There are many children who their home situation do not enable them to come in contact with music. Further, there are children whose parents cannot afford the instruments that they need to perform some kind of music. For these children, the school is a good place to discover whether music is a subject they want to specialize or not. Secondly, studying music at school helps children to develop social and creativity skills. Many schools that impart music lessons, permits children to establish their music groups. Through this many children will learn how to work with other people, but also how to deal with problems like quarrels. Another vantage of studying music in schools is that music will incentivize the child's creativity, because children have the chance to write their songs and to provide groups performance. To conclude, it is obvious that studying music at school provides many advantages for children and that music is even important as other school subjects like history and Biology because it permits children to learn the needed social and creativity skills.

I think it is important to tell the truth in general. However, it is sometimes necessary to tell a lie, too. There are situations in which it is harmful for others to tell the truth. For example, suppose that your friends ask you about what you think of their clothes. Even if you think they are bad, you will compliment their style. If you were to frown at their style, it could result in annoying them. In another example, if you are not satisfied with a gift from your friends, you will not complain about it. After all, you should avoid disturbing others' feeling by telling them your true feelings. Although you should not be sometimes honest, it is significant to tell others the truth otherwise. If you choose not to be honest, it may lead to undesirable consequence. For instance, if you told business partners fake information, it would end up with losing their trust. This is a problem not only for you but also for both your colleague and your boss. He might have to take responsibility for his subordinate's faults, and resign. Thus, you should not tell a lie to others in the situation which it harms others. In conclusion, it is ever acceptable to tell a lie. However, it depends on the situation. It is most important to distinguish the situation you should tell a lie from the one you should not.

Every season holds something special to it. However, to me, autumn happens to be the most magical season of the year. First of all, I find the weather to be quite endearing. The chilly winds of September are a nice break from the summer heat. The cold weather also indicates the beginning of sweater weather. I am in love with jumpers and anything with long sleeves, hence the cold weather is a great opportunity to start wearing layers once again. The landscape also becomes maginificent. The colourful leaves falling off the trees are almost mesmerising to look at. The ground covered with a blanket of colourful leaves makes any stroll much more pleasant. Autumn is also special because of Halloween. Although I no longer celebrate it as I used to, I feel delighted seeing other people enjoying themselves. This time of the year also unites several communities on social media, and together we celebrate the arrival of the spooky season.

Our relationship with our teachers is usually linked with many factors like mutual trustness; respect as well as estime. Like a majority of students, I think it's more interesting and good for students to have new teachers each year. There are many reasons for that believe: first of all, meeting a different teachers during our learning give us a good opportunity to improve our knowledge and skills not only about topics but also about life; secondly, to have one teacher couldn't give you a possiblity to discover different point of view. Finally, meeting different teachers means earning new learning approches as well as new way to resolve our usual problems. In other words, being taught by one teacher each year remains very boring and ininteressant even if the teacher is very qualified. To summarize my opinion, I would say I'm very convinced that changing teacher every year is very useful.

My dear friend, Finally, I got the chance to attend the Kayhan Kalhor's concert last week. As you know, I have been a fan of him for many years, but I never got the chance to go to his concert. Kayhan is an Iranian Kurdish artist who is a professional Kamanche player, one of the traditional musical instruments in Iran. He is not only a special artist for Iranians, but he is also known as a famous artist in many nations. In this concert, he played several of his outstanding piece of music such as Halbach. The atmosphere of the concert was full of traditional Iranian feelings which took us to the villages of Kurdistan. All I needed at that moment was silence and listening. I felt that I was on another level of life and I was looking at my life from a different perspective. It was really fascinating and I hope you also could one day find this opportunity to attend his concert. Regards, Fatemeh

Video games are widespread among children. Playing video games might be advantageous to them. Nevertheless, it will bring some drawbacks if parents cannot control how their children play video games. This essay will analyze the advantages and disadvantages when children play video games. On the one hand, playing video games can be beneficial. Firstly, it helps children relax after hours of studying. When they have time to rejuvenate, children will have more energy to go back to their studies. Secondly, while playing games, children can learn some new skills such as problem-solving, time management, and teamwork (if they play games together), which are necessary for themselves later in life. Challenges in video games force children to think, to use their minds to find solutions, and to help each other for the final purpose. These are some benefits when children play video games. On the other hand, it might be harmful if children play games too much. Hours of looking at the screen will damage their eyes, which leads to many negative effects in children's life. They will not learn effectively and fully develop with an unhealthy eyes. Also, playing games too much make children tired. From that, they will be less active and lose their interests in other kinds of activities such as running and playing outdoors. These are the reasons why parents should monitor and limit the time of playing video games of their children. In conclusion, playing video games is a double-edged sword. Although it contributes positively to the development of children, there are still many drawbacks. Parents should be aware of these advantages and disadvantages to help their children control the use of video games.

To keep chlidren occupied by useful activities is usually a great challenge for parents. in the past, reading a book or watching television were enough for enjoying children but now it's very diffuclt to satisfay them. The video games are obviously the favourite occupation that children prefer in this century. but why? In my modest opinion, it's due for the frame of games: it's occur them all the things that they need like advertisements, connection with other friends or sel esteem feeling. Many parents consiousless about the danger that video games represent. It's proved that using video games for a long time lead children for a dangerous type of psychological disease like shkisofrenia. I continue to believe stongly that video games are very dangerous and I will do evreything in my ability to avoid my children to use it. unstead of that, I will certaily encourage them to be friends with book and magazine. To summarize my opinion, I will encourage my children to be creative.

Many people believe that having the same teachers for several years is beneficial for students. And some think that changing the teachers every year is better. For me, both reasons have many pros and cons. The advantages to have the same teachers are the teachers know best about their students and they also keep tracking the development of students. On the other hand, the teachers will bias with some students and like some. Another reason, the students have been taught the same idea of living and that is not useful because the students should be taught in different ideas. For people who would like to have new the teachers each year, there are many benefits ,for example, the students will learn new things and new critical thinking. Both teachers and students learn how to adapt together because it is a good lesson for real life. But the problem of changing the teacher is thachers don't know their student well and it will take a long time in order that they will get along with each other well. In conclusion, I think that having new teachers is better than the same teachers because to learn new things with new people is good for life learning skills.

First and foremost, it is common knowledge that working out is important for our health. However, doing sports is not enough to be in good shape, for crying outloud! There is another major aspect that need to be taken into consideration. First of all, I will explain why exercise should be part of our daily routine. Then, I will shed light on the needs to have good eating habits. To begin with, to do some exercise you don't need to run a marathon. Most people resent sports because they believe it is too demanding and painful. As a matter of fact, you just need to walk thirty minute per day to be in shape. It's not rocket science. For those who like to challenge themselves, there are a lot of activities that can be achieve as crossfit. Moreover, exercise can have other positive impacts. Not only is it important for our body but also is it essential for our mind. Indeed, exercising prevents depression, stress and anxiety. Notwithstanding, exercise is important, but our eating habits comes before anything else in order to be healthy. In any case, we need to be careful to what we put in our plate. For instance, it is important to have the right amount of carbs, proteins, and nutriments. That is to say, we should avoid fat and sugar. Furthermore, we need to drink at least two liters of water each day to help our body to recover. There is no age to start a healthy way of living. Better late than never!

Many would agree that the ultimate goal of life is to live longer and in happiness. Clearly, living a modest live for 100 years for me is more valuable than living only 20 years in abondance. I believe that living longer is better because it is a signe of well lived life and a longer service for other people. I believe in the old adage that says "to live better you need to hide." People who live a good life are generally those who have chosen to do everything moderately. For example, having good health habits such as eating moderately and not allowing excess alcohol might lengthen the live. Although the length of one's life can be determined by many factors, one should definitely avoid degerous activities. Some people for instance choose to drive very carlessly or very fast on road just to show to the world how smart they are. This behaviour sometime, can lead to a sudden death. Moreover, living an intense life doesn't always mean living well or being helpful to other people. For example, mother Theresa of India had lived a long life but had been of a tremendous help for many people in the world. This means that life does not necesseraly need to be intense to be meaningful. Many have lived a long an enjoyable life without being famous or known by everyone at every side of the globe. This said, I prefer a longer and smooth live instead of a short life full of excessive behaviour. To conclude, we do not all determine the lengh of our life. And we can only try to bring the best out of the time we have existed.

The programme shows you all mistakes in spelling and grammar which is common in most of the writing programs. What's more, Write and Improve will check your whole sentences too. On the other hand there are some things missing in this programme. In this programme there should be also tips which could help you improve your text when you have corrected everything and have no mistakes left. Furthermore in Write and Improve there were some mistakes too. I used one common English phrase and this programme corrected me. All things considered I would recommend Write and Improve for all students who want to learn how to write in English. Anyway there is still a lot of space to upgrade this helpful tool for students.

Our unsaistainble developpent lead us unhappily to an ecological disaster during these tree last decenies. We saw how pollution and immoral modernity were destructed massively all the ecosystemes around the world. the biodiversity was highly and negatively impacted. The animals were eventually among the unliky victims from those huge impacts and some people think doing good, imaginated this tragic and stupid invention: the zoo; The zoos could be the real space for protecting animals but actually they are a real prison for animal. In other words, the zoos changed highly the environment of animals. In my modest opinion, the zoos reamain a bad solution for protecting animal wherease the real solution is to provide animals free space and giving them protection in order to leave them living as the ever creature of god live: free

Dear Major Muller, I'm writing to ask you to dismiss the idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Nowadays, mobile phones are an important part of our lives. While using the public transport, they can help us to catch up with the latest news or stay in contact with our friends. Furthermore, there are also a wallet. Apps enable us to use it as a credit card or even as a ticket to be able to access public transport. I understand that it can be annoying if someone is having a phone call, while being in a restaurant or is using the public transport, but in world where everything is connected that the price we have to pay. If our town were to ban the use of mobile phones in public transport or in shops and restaurants, we would disconnect our town from the world. This ban could also lead to the fact that more people will use their car instead of public transport. But using a car is not only bad for the environment, it is also more dangerous to use your phone while driving than it is to use it in a bus or in a metro. As there is no harm done to anyone, it makes no sense to ban the use of mobile phones in public transport or in restaurants and shops. I appreciate all that you do for our city. Sincerely, Ben Singer

First and foremost, digitalisation had brought us many changes and challenges. Our environment had drastically evolved and no realm had been left aside. In the situation, what about schools ? How will they be in the future ? Will they still be the same ? First of all, I will tell you why I believe schools will be different soon enough. However I will explain why some things will remain the same. To begin with, digitalisation had enter our life at any stage. As a matter of fact, we now have access to a large range of skills and tools. Smartphones, computers and tablets are made available for everyone. Additionally artificial intelligence can provide new learnin approach. On that ground, I think the school of the future will use those different applications to re-invente itself and offer new possibilities. For example, screens could be implemented on desk boards. Furthermore, kids need to be able to use any technological devices easily. Not only is it a way to fit the world but also is it essential to find a job. Moreover, I believe, in just a few years from now, students won't need to attend classrooms anymore. Indeed, I think e-learning will become extremely popular. Actually, a lot of business schools are already using it and it an outstanding success, for crying out loud! However, I believe some aspects will still be the same. For instance, there will still be teachers, and grades. Last but not least, I believe human contact is a need for young children and it can't be replaced by artificial intelligence. Finally, all those transformations will take some time. Better late than never.

I would live a shorter life rather live a long life. There are two reasons why I think so. First, I cannot be viable all my lifetime. At the end of my life, I will not be active like before, and I can only stay at a hospital. I cannot endure the situation that I manage to live with aids of medicine. I would like to pursue something until my life is over. Even more, we can enjoy our freedom because it is limited by the surroundings. If I lived in a long life, I would have few things to do and would be bored with my freedom. Second, in my opinion, shorter life is more stimulating than longer one. As I get older, I will experience less owing to physical disabilities. It seems to me that people face too many things between in their 20s and in their 50s. Therefore, unless I would die in my twenties, I could have variable experience. I could become satisfied with it. Moreover, I set my life plan in which I will be dead in my seventies. Considering the scheme, I am willing to try anything as long as I am viable. It leads to making me busy, but at the same time I can enjoy my time more than others. In conclusion, I prefer living a shorter life to living a longer life. It is significant for me to be active during my lifetime. Thus, I always make much effort to fulfill my life.

Fighting ignorance is a huge and difficult struggle. Since we were children we were involved in that way. When we integrate school earlier, we choice our way towards discovery and learning. Students had almost the same dream which is to follow their studies abroad especially when they are living in countries lessdevelopped as mine. This difficult choice has an advantages like disavantages. the most advantages that it has, in my opinion, is that allow students to follow their carriers in high level of school. one other important advantages is to permit for students to discover new culture as well as new civilisation and eventually learn about a new concepts and new field of learning. The disadvantages for this painful choice are numerous like the psycholgical impact of being abroad. The difficultises that students face in foreign countries for example racism or xenophobia. To summarize my opinion, I prefer continuing my studies in my country even conditions aren't sufficient rather than taking useless risks.

First of all I would like to say that I am not university student yet. That means that my opinion is not based on my own experience. Firstly, life as a university student might be hard and many students spent with their school more than 40 hours per week which is usual work time in the Czech Republic. With this in mind, it would be very hard for some students to do a job. I believe that the parents ought to support their children financially during their studies. The imprortant question is whether should the student live at home. In my opinion, it is subjective. The main adventige of living with parents could be the fact that you have really great background and it is cheaper than living on your own. On the other hand when you decide to live alone or with your friends you will probably become more responsible and independent. Furthermore, I believe that staying too long with your parents is no good for your relationship and your psychological development. All things considered, I think that everyone should choose for himself and both choices are all right.

First and foremost, globalisation and digitalisation had brought many changes in our world, for crying out loud! They changed the way we work, we travel and communicate. For instance low-cost airlines companies appaered and home office had become common knowledge. Better late than never. Not only is it more important than it used to be but also is it an obligation in some cases. First of all, I will tell you why I believe it is essential to speak a foreign langauge in 2020. Then, I will shade my views regarding some aspects. To begin with, it had become more and more difficult to find a job nowadays. Repeated crises transformed the world. It had become particularly difficult to reach a company expectation. Actually, major market brands are asking people to be fluent in another language as English, Spanish, or Chinese. It might sound demanding but this is the way it work. Moreover, people are travelling way more than they used to do. For example, a lot of students go for a world tour after finishing their degree. In this case, it is better if not obligatory to speak English in order to able to communicate with foreigners. Last but not least, some people are interested in learning about another language because it's part of a country's culture. Notwithstanding, in my opinion it is important to discover a different language than its native one, I believe it also depends on your way of living. Indeed, if someone don't like to travel or is not interested in working in a international company there is no need to spend time on learning about another language. I believe, it matters to shed light on different opinions.

Without goes saying that being an honest individual often implies being truthful and not telling lies. However, is it even necessary? After all, there are countless situations that are more advantageous to tell a little bit of falsehood. A good illustration of this is omit a case that could damage a person's feelings. Furthermore, there are some educational untruths; for instance, to teach eating, make a bed, or even to instruct how to brush of teeth; they can be supported for some deceits. Let us focus on such idea as omitting a fact, forasmuch as there are some consequences for the person who will receive this information. For instance, a mortal who has a terminal illness; perhaps in some cases the best option is not to tell the reality to this citizen. Moreover, another aspect relevant to this context, depending on the condition of the disease, it is so advanced the malaise that a good solution is let him to die without know his real condition. On the other hand, there are pros in relation to educate a child with little lies, since it is impossible to try to have a mature conversation with an offspring. Additionally, apart from educating, an other benefit is to facilitate the parents' life, in other words, the young will not accomplish a mischief, because he will be afraid of those situations. To sum up, to count an untruth now and then does not cause many complications for a child's mental health. Nevertheless, I am convinced that uncountable ways to tell a lie, and oftentimes they are positives so for the individual who receive the advice as the person who lies. Only by understanding that each human has their own convictions and cultures.

I believe, having different teachers for students each year is a good thing, because each teacher has their own style of teaching that they use it to foster students' understanding. In addition to that, each teacher has diffferent qualitiies and skills, thus, introducing new teachers to students each year is an opportunity for them learn more skills and help them engage more academically At my school, we had different teachers for each indvidual year. And we had the opportunity to learn many useful things from them. Some people believe that students should have one teacher for many years. In my opinion, that would create some sort of boredem among students, as well as, students would not have the chance to learn different skills that may be found in multiple teachers. Finally, in my opinion, different teachers with different perspectives and horizons would influence the academic experience for students to the fullest extent. That's why, I see it is very important to introudce different teachers to students each year.

In my opinion, playing video games has a lot of benefits to children than other people think. Children can play video games but parents should arrange their time to play games properly. The most important thing for children is they can grow, play , be funny and happy as their age. Video games is the part of children's memory. I support children to play video games for many reasons. The first reason is that video games can improve fine moter skills and also language development. Because most video games use English as a communication language with other players, their English will get better. The second reason, if someone is fond of the game, they may have the dream to be a game developer who is the person invents or creates new games or new items. The third reason, now there are many game competitions or Electronic sports (E-sport) around the world. Many children turn to be the E-sport gamers and win in the contest. Another reason, some children can earn money by themselves because when they reach any high levels, they can sell the special items to other players. The last reasons, video games can help to solve mental problem of children who has addicted game. In conclusion, the game have both pros and cons. If people arrange time properly, they can get many benefits from video games.

In my opinion, zoos are good places for people to learn about animals because it is necessary to understand their way of life. Zoos could be important places to open the mind of people who doesn't care about animals well-being. Moreover, zoos raise awareness people about endangered species. Many people don't know that a species like white bear could be disappear in 2100. Additionally, zoos are very useful for help injured animals. Near my home, we have a zoo specialized of doplhin re-education. However, there are a few reports of animals abuse in zoos. Some of them doesn't respect animals dignity and their principals needs. For example, a monkey died at Abidjan zoo private of foods and love. Furthermore, some species become crazy because of visitors noise, small cage and loneliness. As a consequence, some of them hit themselves. To conclude, zoos have a great purpose, but instead of saving and protecting species they conduct them to an untimely passing.

Hello Matt, How are you? I hope you are in good wellness. Thank you for your kind to be my English buddy. I want to tell you about my favourite film. It from India, the title of the film is "Mumbai." I don't know exactly the genre of this film. Probably, it is action, comedy and historical film. Because the story is based on the real tragedy in India. Then, there are funny in some scenes of it. It is about terrorism so I said the film is an action film. The film tells us about the tragedy which happens in one of the hotels in Mumbai. There are three terrorists who hijack the hotel. They are Muslim terrorist who had a command from a person they don't know. Their commander said that they in a God way. But actually, it's not about it. I mean, the commander just exploit the people to his advantage. There is one scene I really love. It when there is a conflict among the terrorists. They argue about to kill a Muslim woman. The one said that He can't kill her because she is Muslim. But the others said he must kill her because the commander said that. You must watch this film Matt.

On the one hand, it is obvious that health is the first and most important aspect for human beings and should not compare with other aspects of life. In the absence of health, the abundant amount of money cannot help and heal the pain of body and soul. If one person does not have a state of health, he/she cannot do any type of activity during the day and cannot enjoy the physical activities that require a healthy body, even if his/her bank deposit is large. On the other hand, the influence of money on a healthy lifestyle cannot be underestimated. A person who has more money can easily provide better living conditions and also consume better and more varied food which leads to better health of the body. Also, they can spend a pleasant holiday that helps their mental well-being. In conclusion, while money can implement better circumstances for a superior and healthier lifestyle, I think maintaining health should be the first goal in our lives, as working and making more money is possible only with a healthy mind and body.

I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich, it is more important to be healthy, because if your body isn't healthy, you will feel very sick, you will have a lot of complications in your body, you would have to take a lot of different kinds of medicine, and if you get even worse, you would die. If you are rich, and decide not to be healthy, and waste all your money on things that don't help you to be healthy, or that are just useless, it won't help you, you get worse, and die and all that money you had was useless. To be healthy hepls your body to be strong, and to not have any bad diseases. That is why you have to be healthy, you should do exercise, eat healthy, and to have a balanced diet. That is my opinion about which is better, to be rich or to be healthy.

In my opinon, doing exercise is very important for our health and our well-being.

Moreover, if you doing sport with a friend, you can get more motivation and you could become better. To do this, it is also important to fix you a purpose. However, exercise is not the only thing important for our health. Indeed, there is an obvious link between nutrition and health. Have a healthy food is the first step to have a better health.

We have a great change in our society nowadays because of this COVID-19 situation. We are forced to stay at home and do remote work. Many schools also need to change in this circumstance. In the future, students won't have to go to school. They will be able to learn all subjects at home at the internet schools. They cooperate with other students by online conference system. They can get any information needed for their studies from website all over the world. They even do sports using online sports application named "e-sports." As I said above, we can do everything online except direct interaction with others. We know that physical contact is still important for children's development. We have to build playgrounds or gymnasiums at school because students need place to play. But we won't need school buildings anymore. We won't need to have as many teachers as we have now, because only a few teachers can learn all students through the internet, and AI may help teachers' work.

Dear Town Council, I think banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants is not a good idea at all. As mobile phones have been near humans for over two decades and these electronic devices can be taken anywhere and can be opened within seconds. Banning would result in people taking laptops everywhere they go and also use laptops the whole time, which would again lead to a mass protest. As the digital age grows, mobile phones get better and advanced than other devices. As the name suggests 'mobile phone', people can take it anywhere without an additional 2.3 kg. Imagine this, people taking laptops everywhere they go. In restaurants, shops, restaurants and on public transport. Some people would just be using the laptops to navigate and call and even take photos. That would be awkward to a normal mobile phone user as laptops can only be used as selfies and when not held nicely, it may drop and get damaged. While on the other hand, mobile phones can be used for both selfies and normal photos. As other devices are mostly just for work, school and others, mobile phones can do everything. They can be used for work, banking, researching and more. Consider this whether mobile phones should be banned or not. If mobile phones are banned it would lead to a huge protest which could make most of the high ranking workers to resign.

I disagree with it. There are three reasons why I oppose that opinion. First, sports activities are the only solution to keep people healthy. Running or doing yoga can also work as the method of promoting our health. If universities and schools made their students exercise in their facilities, it would be difficult to fulfill all students' favors. Some students would not be satisfied with the schools' policies. However, if the schools let their students exercise outside, it would be also hard to manage the students' activities. Briefly, it is absurd from scratch to force students to do exercises regularly. Second, there is little scientific evidence to support the frequency of playing sports. Is it really enough to do exercise three times a week? This opinion does not explain at all how many hours we should exercise in a week. At least, those who are in favor of this opinion should provide information about the basis of their statement. In my opinion, they cannot get support from others without showing prominent scientific evidence. Third, I think it is not always good to make much effort to become healthier. It is true that there may be no problem for many people to be forced physical activities. However, it is not the case for some people with disabilities. Such people cannot participate in sports as well as ordinary people. To improve our inactive lifestyle, we only have to increase the opportunities of exercise. It is appropriate for only healthy people, and this idea utterly ignores people who are willing to exercise but cannot do. If the given opinion pervades among a lot of universities and schools, it will be natural to get rid of people with disabilities. Thus, I am against this opinion. It seems to me that this opinion is not persuasive and dangerous. Therefore, I never admit it.

In my opinion, transport sector was highly hit with the currently pandemic. Therefore, this sector will need to be more ecological. For me, in the future, people will travel with plane or by train because it will be more fast and safe. Planes could go to any cities in less 2 hours thanks to supersonic technologies. Of course, people will still take boats but only for the pleasure. Indeed, in our future society, take a boat for travel will not be ecological with the use of petrol. Therefore, a majority of people will take the train for the same reasons that they will take planes, the speed. In the future, they only will take transport for the speed and not for the landscape. Of course, cars would be always used but only electric cars. To conclude, the future of travel will combine two factors, ecology and speed. These will be necessary to protect our earth and travel in our planet.

In this days, balancing between the practical work and theoretical is one of the most important conflict in education system. One program which is offered by specialists is involving students in the practical work by volunteer work. Community service has some pros and cons and considering these is important to make a good decision for teenagers. At first, working in a volunteer environment in high school can help students to improve their skills. Working as a volunteer increases their confidence and prepare them for doing real job. In addition, learning work ethic is one of the most important aim of doing community service. Students learn to how they can help other people. Volunteers’ teacher mostly are patient and energetic people. These characteristics help teenagers to change their bad behaviors and develop their passions and ingenuities. On the other hand, volunteer work can unsettle students' balance of time management. Students must deal with doing homework, sporting, preparing for exams and practical work. Generally, community service lacks structure and this can lead students to confuse in managing their time. Besides, some volunteer atmospheres are unsafe and uncertain. People who work in these places can be different and unknown. So, finding a good environment is important and parents and the school’s staff must consider it precisely. In conclusion, developing social and professional skills are valuable and useful for students. Achieving these goals needs practical plan and considering enough time in school. Therefore, community service has some significant advantages for teenage students. Disadvantages of volunteer work are less important than its goodness. By helping peers to manage their time and providing secure surrounding can reinforce volunteer plans in high schools. Hence, students are able to be professional people in the society after finishing high school.

Hello Lisa, like I promised you in my last letter I want to tell you about the concert I was last week. It was not usual concert but an open air one. There were so many people! And everyone sit on the ground on their blankets or chairs they brought with them. I liked the atmosphere there, especially when the sun went down and it got dark. The orcester on the stage played mostly classic music, but sometimes also famous songs like the introducing melody to "Star Wars"-Film. Altogether I enjoyed this concert very much and would like to go there next year again. Maybe we can do it together. What do you think about it?

I have many free times nowadays. And it makes me feel bored. I try to find many activities that make me feel excited. Recently, I have new things that I love to do in my free time.

Even, sometimes I am not only repeating the dialogue but also writing it on my book. So I can read it again later.

Sport is very important exercise for our health. Doing sports especially in the morning has a huge benefit on our moral as well as our mood . Personally, I prefer doing jogging. This old sport is easy and helpful. We can do it either in cities or in the gardens. As I live near the sweet beaches, what I like stoo much is obviously swimming as well as surfing; these two sports have many advantages and had a numerous good effect on our health. We can do it regularly and easily either during spring or summer. I continue to believe that there are many other activities, rather than sport, that we can practise like Yuga and meditation. These two Asiatic disciplines are widely practiced not only in India but also in other countries around the world. To summarize my opinion, I’m convinced that the sport is the main activity that having a good and deep impact for our health and consequently for our heart.

Travelling as we know it and did it for decades will come to an end. Due to the ongoing discussion about the environmental costs of easy travelling things start to change. In the future fewer people will use cheap flights for unnecessary weekend trips into sunny spots of the earth. More and more people will become conscious and will try to avoid stress on the environment when starting over for holidays. So, having fun in the neighbourhood by for example doing bicycle tours or walking and hiking will see a renaissance. This also will strengthen the rural economy, so that money could be spent to develop local infrastructure and local offers. This will lead to a broader variety of possibillitiies. In the end, lots of people will find options for their vacation nearby. Spending gallons of kerosine and polluting the sky and environment to allow people to have weekends in Spain for less than 30 € will soon be a thing of the past.

In high schools there are a lot of different groups which makes some voluntary projects. There are for example teams who organizes balls, another group makes different products with high school logo and other grows plants and flowers in school garden. And there are always students who are in thousand communities and other students are in none of them. But what if joining a voluntary team will get mandatory? On one hand by doing some works for high school students learns a lot of skills they will nedd later in their adult life. Skill like working in a team or carrying responsibility are very important undepending of where you are going to work later. In addition high schools get also profit from such work, because student mostly know better what other students need and how to make their school day better. On the other hand there are students who are already in some sport clubs or music schools. And they maybe do not have time for any voluntary work at high school, so it can get very difficult for them to manage everything and to do homework too. In summary I think that obigatory work for high scholls is a good thing if it has not need too much time and you still have a choice what kind of work you would like to do.

In fact, video games are very popular nowadays with children. Recently, technology has made it possible for children to have fun at the comfort of their homes compared to the times when children very often need to be taken outdoors to have entertainment, and that's very good. However, there are indeed some positive and negative effects. the positive effects of video games on children is that children can have more fun at home - playing and expressing themselves through games. In addition, parents of children will have the chance to do home activities while children are busy with playing video games. In spite of that, video games content can be very aggressive nowadays, and not appropriate with young children who are under 18 years old. Because, this will pose negative impact on the child's personality, because they are in an age that isn't allowed to view violent or aggressive content even when they are on the Internet. Although parents can still have control on what their children are viewing whether on Television or the Internet or a video game. And apparently, computer devices now have parental control settings, where parents can restrict or trace their children’s activity online. With the appearance of some video games that contain violent scenes, children are becoming more violent-loving. And that what explains the violence among school children recently such as the violence we see in some shooting and murder games, although these games are targeted at teenagers and adults. But young children are increasingly wanting to play such games, because it is spread among their older siblings. I think, parents need to be aware of the good types of video games to buy for their children and make sure these games do not contain violence or targeted at the age of their children.

Some employers think that separate spaces are better for their employees than open offices, while others believe that this will reduce the quality of work. In my opinion, it totally depends on the type of work and job that company is doing. If the type of work falls into a category which requires deep focus, then, a shared office will not be not a good idea. The distraction caused by others will drain the employees' concentration and the quality of work will be decreased. For example, in a programming company, the employees need a quiet environment to focus on their codes, and a noisy place or a place full of movement will not let them focus on their work. On the other hand, some type of companies need a sharing office since contacting with other colleagues during the work time will generate more creative ideas and can lead to a strong relationship between them which is needed for work. Furthermore, some of the projects are defined to be done in a team and offices with open design can make the team's results more effective as the team members are constantly in touch with each other and all the team know the progress of the project and what will be the next step.

In my opinion, the better choice for these students is to move away and live on their own while they are attending school. Of course, this is the most difficult choice because it is necessary for these students to work and get their own salary. With a job, they have less time for their other activities like working their exercises, having fun with their friends or cooking. Therefore, with this experience, they can becoming more independent and responsible. They can also gain autonomy. However, live at home with their family is also a good choice. They are less lonely, they have always a contact with their family and they feel better. Moreover, one of the most advantage of this situation that these students spend less money. However, it is more easy for them to have a party in their flat that their parents home. Personally, I have lived both experiences and I preferred when I was alone, in my own flat.

Nowadays children do not go outside to play ball or to make picnic, as they used to sit in front of their computers and to watch movies or to chat with someone. To solve the problem of deficite activities which comes up through such lifestyle, some school and universities want to dosport training mandotory for everyone. What advantages and disadvantages does it bring? A good point about it is that children have the possibility to spend their afternoon together. Especially younger children are not able to organize any afternoon activities without parents. So they have to stay home and do the best of it by surfing through the web. But by doing something together like playing football or dancing they learn not only sport skills but also communicating and working in a team. Another point is that parents often do not have enough time to find any sport clubs for their children and as a result children have no possibility to try any sports and to find out which one is interesting for them. But if schools provides plenty of sports it will be easier for children to choose the attractive one. On the other hand if the variety of sports provieded by school or university is not big it could be a problem, because not everyone like football or dance. There are also children who like for example riding or playing table tennis. A a result this young people have to choose between sports they like and sports they have to do. And this is not the sense of idea. But there are a simple solution for this problem, when children are allowed to do either sports in their school or in some other clubs which does not belong to school. In a summary I think that forcing children to do sport is a good opportunity for their health and their development. But they still must have chances to choose what they like to do.

Well. The video games have some impact on the attitude of the children, for example a child that plays video games every day, in the future he doesn't want to have an only day without playing any video games, and that could be a very big problem, especially in children and also adults that can't stop playing video games. But also some video games help to learn, that is positive because if children want to play video games, better the play and learn at the same time, also some studies say that learning and playing it's better for children under 12 years old to learn a lot than the classic way of only listenng and reading it's better for older people. For example a children that learn as the same time he plays learn a lot because he or she is in a good humor. That's essential for learning. In conclusion children doesn't have to play all the time video games, but if a children only want to play, we can remplaze them for educational games.

I've always believed animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. The reason is because each animals suffers being in small cages, with not much food and with people treat them in such bad way. Let's try and image a lion close in a little space with the only possibility to move him around the cage the whole day. He needs to be free in such a way they can be everything they want. I also agree to learn more about animals because discover new things about them can help us the opportunity to understand better our life and our develop like a society. The problem is that you can learn about them but there is not need to close them in cages, in fact you can do it directly in nature and not to relegate them in limited spaces. It's not necessary and make them boring and sad.

What is the difference between working in cities and working in rural areas? for most medical doctors the diffecnce is huge and as weird as sounds, all of them prefer to work in cities. They put forward several arguments to justify their choices. at first, they think that in cities they could have much customers rather than if they work in rural areas. For example, some of them claims that they can earn three times what they can earn in small villages. Some other doctors justifie their choice by presenting other arguments: existense of high school; availability of garden or cinemas in cities. In my pinion , neither these arguments are strong nor they are convincing because Working in the rural areas or in the villages is so helpful for communities as well as for citizens. To sum up, I have a great esteem for doctors who prefer sforget their selfcentred and eventually accept to help people living in rural areas.

Living in a village or near the city can be very nice, because you have fresh air, neighbours you know and quite atmosphere. But there is one big problem about living in the rural areas: there is always a deficit of medical doctors. There are many reasons for this phenomenon. One of them is that people are mostly interested in growth of their career. And in a big city they have a better chance for it. They can start in a little hospital and by working hard and making enough connections they maybe can open their own practice and earn much money. Another important point is that children and husbands or wives of doctors have more possibilities to find a job or to go to an excellent school or university in a bigger city than in a village. In rural areas there is always only one school children have to go or they must spend an hour or longer every day to participate in the school in the neighbour place. I think that a good option to spread medical doctors through the whole landscape equable is too improve infrastructure in rual areas, so people living there will not feel themselves isolated and it will be more attractive for everyone to move to rural areas than to metropolises.

Firstly, I would like to mention that I am very pleased with my progress in both speaking and writing because I have dedicated my time practising speaking and writing very often.

On top of that, I would also want to improve my listening skills although my listening is quite good, but I sometimes get lost when listening to Australian and New Zealander accents. Because I am more used to British accent, and it is the first accent I heard when I was learning Englsh. There are certain things that I will do to accomplish my goals in this new school year. Concerning my grammar, I will read one grammar book thoroughly and try to practise as much as possible. And regarding my listening skills, I will listen to English podcasts in different accents simultaneously.

Taking care of animals is always attractive to people. Environmental concern makes people to find the ways to keep species safe. But preserving animals in the zoos or in nature is the disagreement between the different group. Some people believe animals belong to natural surrounding and the others prefer to visit animals in the zoos. In my opinion, there are some reasons for both arguments but visiting species in nature is more acceptable for me. Being in a secure space is the first reason for maintaining animals in the zoos. Some people believe humans can protect species which are in the danger by putting them in the cage. In addition, bringing animals in the zoos is the best way to educate people about their habitat. Researching about animals’ behaviors and how to treat illnesses is easier in the zoos. On the other hand, the species suffer from physically and mentally problems because they are forbidden being in nature. Space in the zoos is not the same as in nature for them. Mental problems cause stress for animals and they may die earlier than when they live in a natural environment. Also, keeping animals in the small cage ruins their freedom. They cannot function like living in nature. In conclusion, one stage of overcoming nature is dealing with wild species. Some people prefer to keeping animals in the zoos to control and knowing about them. But for the others is enjoyable to see animals be free and live somewhere they belong. I also prefer to see animals in their natural environment and respect their freedom.

Vancouver is a bustling metroplis full of life. I visited wonderful places such as Stanely park, gas town and the Museum of Vancouver, and I saw incredible things. I can say, those were the most astonishing places I have ever been to. I also gave myself a chance to experience the landscapes, so I went 30 minutes away from vancouver downtown to be in Capilano suspension bridge park to experience fresh breathe. In the Museum of Vancouver I took lots of pictures for the world war II veterans and I also read a little bit about the history of that place. What I like most in Vancouver is the cultural diversity and open-mindedness of its people - they are very welcoming and friendly. In addition, the nightlife is Vancouver is incomparable to other cities in the world, it is very special for restaurants and cafes. I really fall in love with this fun-loving city and I wish I will have the chance to visit again.

There are many polemics about the video game uses for the children, in my opinion it depends on how do they will use the video game. It can be good or can be bad. First of all, the time. If the children use the video game with the free time, for instance, during hours continue it will be so bad. If they play violent games, with deaths and they are very young the routine will be worse. It is dangerous to become an adicction, that the child needs to have everyday, and if she don't have the video game she will be nervous, it is very common nowadays. However, if the time with the video game has a clear limit, if the parents supervise the time and the kind of game, no problem. I guess if the game is interesting and it uses the logic, the intelligence, can be great for the children. Another good option it is use the video game to exercise, today we have some games to make movement too.

I started learning English since I was 3 years old from my mother. I learnt it as my second language which made me be able to communicate with more people and just for fun. However, when I started high school, I realized that English is important more than I thought because it would help me get more opportunity to study abroad by a good English score. Moreover, most reference textbooks I read are written in English more than using my native language. And also, I need to improve my English communicating skill because I don't use English much in my every life so I stiil feel uncomfortable communicating in English when I haven't used it regularly. Finally, I hope I could get a good score in the exam and could attain a good school because of my good English skill in the future.

In my university, there are many students who live in a student house. But, there are also students who have preferred for different reasons to stay their parents home. In my opinion, it is better that students live in a student house for different reasons. In this essay I will entail why I believe that student house is a better choice than staying with your parents. Firstly, living on your own is better than living with your parents at your university time, because students who live alone develop skills that they need for their foreseeable future. Living alone means that you have to cook yourself. Furthermore, living alone makes you notified what it means to live alone. You are also learning taking properly decisions, because you are aware of your responsibilities. Therefore, you are pondering more, before taking paramount decisions. Another pivotal lesson of living alone is learning how to manage your money. Most of the students who live alone receive students lends that they can use to pay their rent and school books. This will enhance the financial knowledge of the students. However, there are many aspects who impede students to live alone in their students. The cost of livelihood is in many Western-countries increasing considerably. Therefore, many students can afford to live in a student house. Furthermore, many universities are established in a city where housing is very bad. As a result, many students can find student house and are coerced to stay with their parents. To extrapolate, living alone during your university time is a crucial occurrence in your life that will heighten your social and economic ability.

First of all, I would like to say that telling the truth is important and that it can’t be bad in any situation. Furthermore, every moment is totally different and you have to choose for yourselves in all of them. There is no general rule for telling the truth, being silent or lying. I am of the opinion that people should always try to act good and do good. The main question is whether is it sometimes better to say a lie than the truth. I believe that telling the truth can’t be bad at all, as I said before. Nevertheless, the truth is that you can hurt someone with the truth or cause some problems in relationships etc. For instance, if someone asks you whether he’s fat you might lie to him because you don’t want to hurt him. There is also the option of not telling anything which could be the best decision in many situations. I think that it is always better than a lie because the lie is bad in substance. To put it another way if you don’t want to answer the question with a lie you should probably not tell anything. All things considered, I believe that in situations where you can’t tell truth you ought to be silent. If it is not possible, than you might lie but only because of a good purpose.

One of the main skills to develop nowadays is related to being able to communicate properly, this skill not only involves to master your own language, but includes to learn several languages. This is an important factor in toodlers as it is well known that the ability to learn another language is developed in human brains from early years. For that reason, parents invest a lot of money in their children's education, mainly in bilingual programs. In fact, there are many surveys that correlate learning a foreign language with better opportunities in the future. In a world connected by internet, there will have always a demand for learning new languages as many as it is possible. Moreover, today more than in the past, to dominate many languages as possible is a key factor to having a successful career. For that reason, there are huge demand for website platforms and language teachers, as well as online resources for learning languages.

Volunteer work is a type of activity that enable us to realize many good actions towards people or communities around the world. In order to graduate, some high schools ask their students to achieve certain amount of volunteer work . for example, blood donation, becoming a leader in a youth club, facilitating art workshops, being a positive role model for a young person, and many more. Many students respond positively to this request otherwise others see this demand like a loud and additional charge. For many students this kind of work enable them to see a new horizons and discover their capacities. It is also an occasion for students to explore a new social as well as politic issues that impacting our world. In my opinion, schools shouldn’t impose like this requirement because volunteer work must remain volunteer. Furthermore, to graduate on school should be the result of personal effort for each student not conditioned by other activities.

Working overtime mean you are making more money but that it's not the case for the doctor in a litter town hospital. That is why they all try work in big city that they can make a massive forturne.

Well, in my opinion it's good to have the same teacher for several years, especially in younger children that often get adapted at a unique way to learn. But in primary and high school students it's better to have a lot of teachers, because a teracher doesn't know all that a student need to finish their studies, it's good when you study languages too, because on an language have a lot of ways to speak it and it's better to know different accents. In conclusion it depends on each children, because some children only learn with an unique teachers, but other learn with a lot of teachers, a important thing also are the parents, because when at home are only with one of them, for he or she is more easy to learn with a unique teacher, but when the child grows with both parents, for he or she is more easy to learn with a lot of teachers. Thank you

I think television entertains, and it can also educate. There are an enormous number of TV programs all over the world. Some of them are dramas, movies, music, animation, and so on. Those programs can entertain us. We can enjoy these programs with our family or friends. But there are other TV programs such as news, documentaries, and so on. These programs can teach us new knowledge and information. Also, there are many educational programs on TV. We can learn many things from these programs. If we join the online university program, we can get the grade for university graduation. Recently, we got high-grade technology for interactive communication. If we use this technology on TV, we can communicate with other people directly and simultaneously. It's a surprising situation that we couldn't imagine 5 years ago. We can get direct education from school using this technology. I imagine that TV may have a big capacity to change our lives totally in the future.

Many people think that health and wealth are two the most important things in our lives. Nevertheless, to my mind there is no more valuable thing than our health. Even being rich isn't as important as being healthy. We need to always take care of our health. When we are healthy we can do almost everything. The whole world is open for us. In that reason, when we are healthy we can become rich. Unfortunately, the richcan;t be sure that they will be healthy their whole life. Actually, many people think that when they have a lot of money, they are protected from everything. However, they forget that the best things in life are worthless and they can't buy them. I'm aware of that money can help in healthy lifestyle. However there are many opportunities to take care of our health. All of this depend on our behavior and attitude. We should remember that we have only one health and we should care about it. Because all of that, I honestly believed that there is no more important thing that our health.

These last years and especially this year with the Coronavirus pandemic, we saw the following problem: A majority of medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money while there are not enough doctors in many rural areas. Thus one wonders what are the reasons for this problem ? Firstly, a majority of medical doctors want to work in cities because they have their friends near them and they can do a lot of activities. In brief, the major advantage is human contact. Secondly, the wages are more attractive in cities than in rural areas. So now we have identified the reasons for this problem, what could we do ? Firstly, we could increase the salary for medical doctors who accept to work in rural areas. We could also regroup all medical doctors who work in rural areas on the same competitiveness hub.

To achieve a high level in University is the purpose for many university students. Some students prefer to live at home with their Family during their universtity studies. This modeste choice is dicted by many reasons: in the one hand, these students didn't have enough money to cover university fees; in other hand,by staying with their family, the students could count on their parents when they face some difficulties. Other students prefer to move away and live on their own when they start their university studies. In many cases, they choose to travel even abroad. This second choice is dicted essentially by their hope to become free and independent. It is also the result of personal maturity and open mind spirit. To sum up, both of these two strategies are valid and defensible. The most important thing is indeed how to mobilize efectively all of means in their own in order to achieve their goal

There can be many thoughts on this topic but I personally feels that teacher should be changed every year because that's how life works. You'll not always get a chance to work with the same people . We need to get out of our comfort zone and that's how life goes. We need to interact with different people so that we can understand maximum people thought progress and get a chance to learn something from other experience. This goes same with teachers also. We need to get used to learn from different individuals so that we can make a good thought system. For example , if we go for a particular topic on particular reference book, one reference material say same thing in a different way and other in different but at the end we get to know about two way to approach particular problem. Teachers also taught us different approach to reach particular problem. And that is what It counts at the end and it should be.

As a child everyone learns to tell the truth always. But is it right option to do it every time without exceptions? I think that lies come up always . At first you think that lying can be convenient. But often it has the same scenario: you beginn with a little lie about something unimportant, but with the time it grows bigger and bigger and at the end it will brust, because it is impossible to think about every detail and to remember everything you had ever said. For example you lie to your frient about being sick, so you can not go to his party. Then you have to think out what kind of sickness it is, where does it come from, how long do you have this and so far. And at some particular point you lies will break down. And you have a big argue with your friend about everything you said to him, what was not true. But on the other hand, if you will tell everyone the truth, you can not live in a community. Sometimes you have to lie in order to stay polite. To be honestly with everyone about everything will cause much trouble. For example if your fellow asks you how you like her dress, it will be polite to say that it is good instesd of telling her the truth that you do not like her look. In summary I think that a question about when you have to be honestly and when not is a very complex topic.

Going to university is a new big step in everyone´s life. And a lot of freshman students think that they are only students when they move out of their parents´ house. But it it really so? I think that nowadays it is common that young people rent their own flat or room when they begin their education in the university. And this has often a good reason: Not every city has universities and not every university has the same directions. For example if you want to study biotechlogy, you will have to go to university which offers suitable courses. And if this university is in another city, your best option is to move to this place. Now by mobility being more convenient it is easier to get to another city and it is getting normal that everyone moves out for study. But on the other hand if you need less than an hour to your study place by train or bus from your parents´ house, I do not think that it is necessary for you to change you flat. Staying at your parents´place you can save a lot of money and it is very convenient to have your mum who makes your laundary and cooks food for you. In summary I think that you do not have to move out without good reasons, because not through changing your flat you become a real student.

There is no doubt that these days all teachers have posative effect in education and learning students, but it is difficult to choose one answer to this question. However: the question is: Do change the teachers every year is good choice for students ?. Actually my personal opinion is if the students need the teacher stay teach them that means they prefer to study with the teachers who they already know them. Also, it is dependon thestudents if the do not want the same teacher and they want to study with another teacher. Sometimes if the teachers change every year that makes the students worry about the subject and teacher character . That maybe will affect on their understanding and their scores. As we can seen , it is difficult to choose one answer depend on just one opinion. Also, we cannot deny the benifts of changing the teachers every year because definitely every teacher has different way to learn his students.

Recently, surfing the Internet, I discovered Write and Improve, which is an online platform to improve English writing. Write and Improve is a very useful tool, because it offers the possibility to practise English for free. It is very inclusive because every English learner can use it, regardless of their level. There are exercises both for those who are beginning and for those who already speak Enlgish pretty well. In this way, everyone can follow a personal path and choose their own goals to achieve. Infacts, there are areas with exercises to get several English Certifications, such as IELTS Academics or B2 First. Write and Improve is so useful because writings can be checked in real time by the algorithm where it is based on. Mistakens, both lexical and spelling, are individuated in real time so that the student can correct them immediately. Moreover, yellow highlights incorrect sentences, by using two different shades: the lighter one is for those sentences which have a few mistakes in their construptions, the darker one is for those sentences which are completely wrong. This part is probably the only one of Write and Improve which should really be improved: it would be very helpful if, after higlighting an incorrect sencence, it suggested a way to make it better and more fluid. Despite this little difect, Write and Improve is an optime tool to improve English and I strongly reconmend to use it to every English learner, from the beginners to the advanced ones.

It is proven scientifically that exercise is important for our health. However, there are other things that are more important than only doing exercise. Our health is affected severely by external stimuli that cause us stress, anxiety and depression. So, exercise can enhance our health effectively. However, exercise alone can never be the solution towards healthy lifestyle. Becuase at the end of the day, every and each one of us is looking for peace of mind. That's why, we do need to do practices that make us stay happy all the day. In addition, our day should be full of various activities, so that we do not get bored. For example, having time to go out with friends for fun is very important thing that boosts our peace of mind. Furthermore, taking up a new hobby like singing, playing piano or doing yoga are all amusing activities that promote our mental and physical health. Eating healthy food is essential for our health; because we are what we eat. Adopting healthy lifestyle might be difficult for some people, but we need think about the physical and pyschological consequences of not adopting healthy life.

There is no doubt that these days Writing&Improving website becoming very popular. However, the quetion: Is this website really help the students to improve their writing or not?. It is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay , I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of this argument there people who are argue that the considerable benefits outwigh the disadvantages. To illustrate, the main reason for believing this is writing & improving website has a lot of tools which are perfect to help students to write from beginning because there are four level for writing first level is for beginner and then to intermediate and finally for advanced and business. The first level , which is for beginner, include some questions which make the students thinking about the answer and write it in easy way. Moreover, this website has some parts to prepare for IELTS test . On the second point of this argument some people argue that the website is profitable, and it provides some amounts from writing and after that you have to pay to complate your progress in writing. Fourthermore, they request high fee to let the learner to improve his or her writing . As we have seen, there is no one easy answer to this quetion. On balance, however, I tend to believe that this website is so good to help all students to improve their writing skills.

The first aspect to point out is all around the world, people are spending more and more time doing sedentary activities. During their leisure time, people like to sit on sofas, watching TV, playing games or just socializing with others. The problem is that many children take their parents example and that can give them diseases. One solution for this problem is to convince kids to do sports activities. To begin with, an extremely important place where you understand aspects about life and gain knowledge to help in materializing your future is school. But school should provide more physical activities for kids to take part in. For instance, children spend on average six hours in school every day while students can stay at school for eight hours. That is a lot of time just to sit on a chair and listen to someone. Children are getting bored as the time pass and they do not pay attention anymore at what the teacher is saying. Secondly, sports activities not only are good to increase attention, but also they reduce high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and feelings of depression and anxiety. For example, one of my acquaintances had problems with anxiety and his therapist recommended him to do exercises and take walks. That worked for him and now he is really fond of sports activities. Those activities made him one of the happiest person I have ever known. On the other hand, there are kids who feel uncomfortable when they are doing exercises in front of other children. Some are often rude and make fun of other's bodies and that can cause self-esteem problems. However, I believe that the results of doing exercises are worth it and you can make the best of it, despite rude people.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I found this requirement absolutely appropriate, because it highlights a problem which most of the times is too much underestimated: that one of social activism. We are habits to do things in order to receive something back, but sometimes things must be done just because they are right. In a society that wants to call itself civil, people must help others without asking for something in return. Helping just to help, without any other purpose, is a wonderful way to make that the personal cultural luggage of everyone grows up. Volunteer work offers the possibility to meet people with different experiences, perhaps coming from other countries or from families with difficult conditions, or to care about animal which had unluckely been adopted by the wrong person. It also offers the opportunity to understand different ways of living and to become aware of the problems that the community has. You can also volunteer by cleaning the beaches from plastic or organizing charity events to raise funds for associations in the area. There are several possibilities to do something good for the community and this is a very relevant point, because everyone can help according to their attitudes. A volunteer work also allows people to learn to be less selfish, which is not so obvious in our days, and that none nor nothing have to be left behind.

I have been learning English for more than 20 years but I have never seen any website for learning English writing which has a feature as good as 'Write and Improve' before. With this website, you can practise writing anywhere if you have a mobile phone or a tablet. There are a ton of assay topics divided into 3 different levels which students can study by themselves. After finishing writing, assays would be checked to find any error by the AI, therefore, they would be evaluated and are given feedback in only a few seconds. If the students have corrected their writing, the graph will show the improvement compared with the previous one. However, there are some problems I found while I was using this website. First, the fonts are too small and the background colour is too bright. Second, I would suggest that the feedback should be more specific to each writing errors because it is hard to find what the writers do wrong by themselves without direct hints. After all, I would like to recommend this website to you, readers. You cannot find any other websites which give you the great opportunity to improve your English without any fee. I believe that this website will gradually be better and become a promising way to learn writing.

I think it wasn't important to learn and speak a foreign language in the past, because it wasn't really importanat to earn job, and money, and not a lot of jobs needed to speak other languages. But now, I think it is important these days, because get a job you now have to speak another language, and if you want to be a flight attendant you need to know more languages, or when your work is to travel, you have to communicate with other people, and you have to now the languages, to know what people from that country are telling you. And also, you can be more smart knowing more anguages.

Every invention comes with both pors and cons. If we are focusing only on one part of a invention than will going to cause serious problem in future. Video games were intvented to provide fun to digital device users and if we go from past to present the journey is quite remarkable and appreciatable the way video games developed itself. Now the video games market grew so fast and vast that they are making games in all genre and soon it will going to replace movies. They are providing us a real-life but virtual reality experience. Now the cons part is that they are being used widely by teenagers and these video games are quite addictive and agressive. certain games are so violent that they make great impact on one's mind very deep. If I have to choose between pros and cons of video games , I'll go with suppoting video games. Yes there is no doubt that video games are impactful but we cannot defy its pros also. Many teenagers take inspiration from video games and make their own video games at every young age which is very progerssive for future generations.

Yes zoos are the great place for people to learn and see the true nature which is we are missing from our life day since we moved towards technologies. Great place for animals to live is their home itself, but this logic is true some decades ago. Today scenario is totally different from what it was before and there is no home left for animals to live . Because of our so called development we cut down trees ,we made soil infertile . So there is no natural home left for animals to live. Even If they live in their home they are fighting for their survival. So it is better to take these animal into zoos so that they can be taken care of. Yes it is true that they will become weak as they are getting food from humans , they are not hunting. Many endangered species are kept in zoos so that they can be in a protection from hunters. People also get to know about these animals so that there can be an awareness about extinction of animals.

Nowadays, with social networks and cellphones, we have forgotten how important has been television for many years. This machine appeared on the 1960's and it has helped us so much. Firstly, the main TV's purpose is communicating and keep people notified. Moreover programs such as daily news or travellling programs, develop intelligency. Besides, you can change audio and consequently, learn to listen other languages. However, social networks show a different content. Secondly, our lives have been changed by TV, since thousands of people work for television, moreover now we can enjoy more communicative elements . Therefore, humanity has grown significately in development. Finally, during this pandemic months, TV has helped children to watch videos classes and educative programs. Although many people think watch many hours TV will harm kids, it is true that it can help us much more than we think.

Dear Sir/Madam I would like to share with you my thoughts about town council's plan of banning mobile phones in public places like shops and restaurants. In my humble opinion such ban has much more drawbacks than positive aspects. I am aware of the fact that nowadays people lifestyle rely on mobile phones and this is indisputable that in some cases we very clearly overuse them. Therefore some people claim that this may lead to pretty serious consequences like inability to understand social interactions. It seems to me that this is rather extremely rare situations so that I believe we should not count it as a solid reason to implement above-mentioned ban. There are also opinions that using mobile phones can disturb other passengers on the buses or clients in the restaurants and the shops. Undoubtedly we could find examples of such situations but I think it is too much generalisations. I strongly believe that most people know how to behave in a way that does not hassle other human beings, even if they acquire mobile phone. In summary I do not find that there are any sufficient reason to claim that ban on mobile phones in public places is necessary. Some people might dislike modern devices, but it is still not enough to limit liberty of others. We should live according to the rule live and let live.

Well, in my opinion the computers and tablets aren't going to remplace books, especially in poor countries which not all the students know how to use a laptop or a tablet, but the books can be less common than today, because at least 3 million people know how to use electronic apillances and those people can use books less frequently. There is a big trouble with e-books too, and that problen is that some people upload the book in digital format for no money and the writers a printer companies doesn't have money from their books and that is a problem that in physical books is less common In concussion the physical books will never disappear from our world because the books help us in a lot of thing that the digital books can't, but they can be less common in the future.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. No one can deny that health is wealth . The ways of taking care of one's health had sparked a great controvesy among the people of all walks of life. Some of them hold the view that being in a state of healthy is a treasure of life, but some of them believe that wealth is more important than health as money is the utmost vital thing for live. As Albert once said, "Happiness is nothing more than a good health and a bad memory," this quote trult prove that being healthy is a happiness in our life. Thus, we should find out the reason why being healthy is more significant than being rich. As far as I am concerned, the dominant reason why healthy is more important can be proved through the old saying, "prevention is better than cure." No doubt, one will suffer from severe disease if they do not take good care of their health, say, they will pay a heavy price for not taking care of their health. For example, although we are a billionaire, but we still cannot "buy health" as we wish and at last we still need to face death. From another view of point, it is undeniable that money is necessary for everyone to live a life as the world is nothing more about money. However, did money really can buy everything for us including health? Perhaps not. We can cite an example about this point. For instance, a breaking news which just happened a month ago, a young men attacked by heart disease when he continued his work late in midnight at his office. It is a earth-shattering news which aware public to take good care of their health besides working. In a nutshell, I think that being healthy is more important than being rich in life. I hope everyone would keep in mind that " life is only once, make it worth.." Needless to say, health is wealth.

Computers and tablets shouldn't replace books. Instead of that, they ought to be used as complementary resources for the education. Firslty, we would have a huge problem. The students would be too much time on their screen. Nowadays, we are already used to using our phones, computers or tablets at least once a day. More than that, studying on screens would spoil definitely our eyes and our brains. That was the first reason. In second, they would have many inequalities in the education. I don't think that the governments of the countries agree to pay for all these products. That means the families themselves should use a huge amount of money to support the education of their children. So that wouldn't be fair. That's why I think that.

There is no doubt that these days Video games becoming very popular with cildren. However, the question: is it useful for children? It is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay , I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints. On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits considerable outwigh the disadvantages for video games. The main reason for believing this is video games assist children to learn new skills and focus on achieve the goal from the games at the end. Additionally, video games create a competition between children to do the best and win. On the other hand from the argument, there are people whobelie that video games are not benefit and it makes negative effect on the children. To illustrate, children spend a long time play without stopping that is not healthy for them . Aswe have seen, there is no one easy answer to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that video games are good choice for entertainment for children, but must parents be careful about their children what they play.

Well, the zoos are places when there are a lot of animals, it's a good idea to be in contact with animals and learn about them. But the animals doesn't have to be in a place, because they want to be free, because the animals for centuries were on the jungle and other places around the earth, and in only 20000 years the human appears that it is too short comparing other especies and being in a zoo for an animal can be stessing too, because being outside it's necessary for everyone, if the human is only 50 days at home he is stressed, imagine an animal being all his or her life without leaving a place In conclusion the zoos are good places to learn about animals, but the animals need to move. An alternative is to do a zoo that for every day in a cage they can be out. That's a great idea.

Music is often said not to be an important subject at school, but I could not disagree more. In this writing I am going to present my reasons to think it so. It goes without saying that music is one of the eldest forms of communication. No matter what your mother tongue may be, everyone can understand the message that every piece of music keeps within. Another point to bear in mind is that you can develop your creativity by learning music, especially when it comes to playing an instrument. By learning how to play an instrument, not only can you more fully comprehend the universal language of music, but you will also value and understand better the effort it requires to play. In my humble opinion, everyone should learn how difficult it is to compose music, as music is one of the oldest languages created by human beings and it will always be a part of our development as a species. We can also learn so much about our own history as we learn and understand how music changes over the years. Last but by no means least, I feel that art subjects should have the same importance that the rest of the subjects have. In summary, I feel that some changes must be made as far as school education is concerned to allow people who are interested in creative subjects to have more opportunities to develop their skills.

Studying abroad is an opportunity for students to explore new lands with different cultures and traditions. It is also a chance to discover new horizons in life; which ultimately add to our life experience. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages for studying abroad. Here are some of the advantages of studying abroad: Recently, studying abroad has become a very popular speech that raised by young people due to the fact that global universities now offer a variety of programs and courses at low costs. Furthermore, studying abroad broadens students' mentality, because they'll have the chance to live on their own away from their families for some time, which in turn enables them to cope with the challenges they could face. In addition to that, getting to know people from different cultural backgrounds is a valuable opportunity to learn so much new things. Although students may step out of their comfort zone and there might be some sort of culture shock, but eventually students will get used to it and start to love their new study destinations. Students usually choose to study abroad for getting quality education so that they can get into good career in the future. However, one of the disadvantages of studying abroad is the fact that minor young people may be prone to some problems because of their young age if they are studying alone overseas away from family. But recently universities and colleges arrange specific type of accommodation to such minor young people by putting them under guardianship of local family - and that's a very good. Another point of the disadvantages as some people think is the process of acculturation, because some people do not prefer assimilatin to new cultures, and they prefer to keep theirs only. Finally studying abroad is full of treaures!

Hundreds of years ago, travel was very difficult for people, due to the fact that means of transportation were not available compared to the world of today. In addition, travel at the time might not be as important as today, because people had everything that they need. But with the industrial revolution, new means of transportation are invented such as aeroplanes, cars and modern ships. Therefore, travel has become easier and more accessible to everyone. As a consequence, that has opened new opportunities for people to discover new lands and start global business; which has led to the globalisation that we witness nowadays. Furthermore, with the increasing scientific progress and technological advances in sciences like Computer Engineering and Astronomy, much more possibilities were recognised; such as space exploration. Nowadays people need to travel to new countries for diverse reasons such as business, education, immigration and tourism etc. So, in my opinion, I think the future of travel is very promising as long as we see a very thriving global economy as well as education and immigration sectors are thriving as well. Hundreds of years ago, people would not imagine the travel possibilities we have now. Similarly, travel can definitely change.

First of all, I would like to say that I haven’t worked in any kind of office or workstation. That means that I have no experience with it and I can write only my own opinion. I believe that there are some ground things which affect the efficiency of the employees. For instance, it is good environment, good purpose of the work and also fun in the work. Based on that, I think that the good employer should take care of these things in the first place. The ground question is whetherthe employees should work together in open places or in some closed cubicles. In my opinion, both have some pros and cons. In open places you have no privacy and you are under pressure. On the other hand, in small cubes you have no space and you will feel probably very uncomfortable. I believe, that there is a better way. The best option would be to have a private office for every employee. All things considered, I would like better to have privacy and work in small space with walls, but I wouldn’t be happy about it.

There are a positive side and a negative side if the student decide to go studying abroad. First, it is not easy, we have a good side about this, the student will be more independent, he will have more effort, in my opinion it is very important to growth. On the other hand, some problems can happen, like depression, difficult in the adaptation, the habits and customs must be different and many people can't adapt. Another problem is the costs, many times the decision about to study abroad needs to consider the price of life in a different country. The majority of the Brazilian students want to study in the United Sates or Europe, and the dollar and Euro are very valorized, so can be very expensive. However, this experience can open opportunities to work in the future, and it is very iinteresting to learn a new language. Finally, if the student has this opportunity he shouldn't lose it, because it is an experience for all their life, to know new people and a new culture.

It goes without saying that studying abroad is something everybody should do if they have the opportunity to do it so. Here, in this writing, I am going to expose the advantages and disadvantages of that matter. To start with, I would like to mention some advantages and how satisfactory spending time and studying abroad could be for anyone. First of all, studying abroad not only will you discover some new places and environments, but also you will be involved in a culture which can be very different from yours. No matter if you stay for a long period or not, being immersed in such situations is always great learning in life, as long as you are disposed to be part of this experience. If this is the case, you will get several new skills such as speaking another language, understanding other lifestyles, and being able to adapt yourself to events you would not face in your own country. Nevertheless, studying in a different country could also be stressful, especially, when it comes to speaking another language which is not your mother tongue. In that way, you may need some help, if you happen not to know how to express yourself in that language. Food and weather conditions can undoubtedly be a problem too, above all, if you go to a place where you will surely find the complete opposite of what you are used to dealing with at home. However, these disadvantages can be lowered jut by acquiring the proper information about the country you are planning to go to. Last but by no means least, I would like to add that the whole experience resulted from living abroad will definitely make a more mature and responsible person of you.

WRITE AND IMPROVE: A MARVELOUS TOOL When it comes to resources and tools for learning languages, it is often said that it is hard to find the right ones to reach the aim you have point to. But, I have to admit that I was greatly surprised by the one called 'Write and improve' from the very moment that I started to use it. No matter if you have a good level or not, this tool already mentioned, gives you the opportunity to test your brain, correct your mistakes, and, what is more, it shows you your erros at once. That makes it enormously useful, since one can have a result in a matter of seconds. Another utility worth mentioning is the clasification it makes of your mistakes, by using different colours to separate important mistakes from the ones which are not. Therefore, this innovative tool cannot be described other way but useful. And, speaking from my personal experience, once you start using it, your motivation rises, especially if you are rewarded with a good mark. I would like to end up by recomending the use of this tool to everyone who is concerned about writing in English. I would not be exaggerating if I say that you will find the benefit of using 'Write and improve' from the very beginning.

I knew all the songs texts and sang to whole time. Today I don't have any voice haha:). My favourite song was "Heartbeat," because it was so emotional. All the flashlights and candles burned.

From time to time we asked ourselves very deep and complex questions about our existence. One of those inquiries is whether we would like to life calmly for 100 years or rather shortly but more intensely. I must admit that is extremely difficult conundrum, since both options have some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, calm, long life seems very peaceful and I would not be taken aback if many people pick that possibility. After all, most of us desire some small home with our beloved family members. Furthermore, everyone wants to delay their death as far as possible. This type of life undoubtedly will suit anyone who does not have enormous ambitions. On the other hand, life mentioned above might be quite mundane and obviously we all want to take part in some kind of adventures occasionally. For me, living intensely means having successful career, being well off and taking part in lots of enjoyable events with my friends and family. Having said that, I am pretty sure that in general those are examples of most popular life goals of any person. The only disadvantage of this option is this short amount of time which we are given, but after some consideration I think that still positive aspects outweigh drawbacks in this scenario. To top off, although calm and long life seems quite convincing, it seems that I would prefer to live shortly byt much more intensely, because I do not want to lose any given opportunity or have any regrets at the end of my life.

Offices tend to have two types of workstations for employees. On one of them workers are secluded from others, while in the second kind no walls separate them from themselves. As usual, these two situations have both some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, people might prepare to work in open workstations, because they are surrounded by other co-workers, who are likely their friends or acquaintances. That may lead to creation of pleasant atmosphere at work. For that reason employees might enjoy their work, which would result in being much more efficient. Furthermore, if someone had any difficulty with their work, then it would not be hard to ask for help since other co-workers would be next to him. On the other hand, I must admit that there are some people who prefer to work on their own. Presence of other people might only disturb them, which would impact on their performance. Moreover, I strongly believe that enclosed workstations or cubicles are much more quiet, which also may enable employees to focus more on their work. To top off, it seems to me that answer to our main question depends on particular worker personality. For employees who like to be surrounded by other people more suitable would be open workstation, whereas to people who can be describe as lone wolves it would not be most optimal choice so they should work in enclosed workstations.

It is true that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. And I used to go with my family to the national zoo in my country, and it was really amazing moments. we had seen various wild animals and it was great experience for me. However, some people believe animals belong in nature and shouldn't be kept in zoos. It is right perhaps, especially when we think of it from freedom context that all animals should have the freedom to live in nature where they belong. Keeping animals in zoos is not only a way of entertainment, but also a chance for animals’ caregivers to look after the sick animals that may be difficult for them to survive alone in nature because of predation. Furthermore, veterinarians carry out scientific research about animals to better understand animal diseases and why they arise and how to prevent or treat these diseases. That's why, animals may be kept in zoos for such studies. I think it makes sense to keep animals in zoos as long as this achieves promising scientific outcomes as well as entertainment. Nevertheless, I still see animal confinement as sort of suppressing their freedom. So, it is highly recommended that animals protection authorities to provide safe zoos with suitable environment so that animals can still feel satisfied while they are being kept in zoos. In my opinion, animal care should be given importance because they are essential part of the ecosystem that we live in. So, protecting animals is protecting our ecosystem. In conclusion, I would say, animals may be kept in zoos for entertainment, scientific research purposes and caregiving. apparently, if there is no way to release all the animals in zoos to the nature, we need to be mindful to give better care.

Since globalisation, people undergo many changes in their lives, and precisely in their speaking. Hitherto, individuals did not travel as much as we do currently. Travel is part of our lives, and people increasingly need to speak different languages just to better understand the needs of foreigners. In fact, we are all connected and we need to engage in discussions and negotiations. If a person doesn't have the ability to integrate and speak at least one foreign language, it would be difficult to negotiate properly and to follow what is going on. It is important nowadays, because companies are going more global, and to succeed employees must know how to speak another language than their native one. It is important also, because at present we are doing international business with foreigners. Before, it was not mandatory to speak several languages because we still could trade with local companies, therefore speak our native language.

Dear Sir and Madam, I read in the newspaper from 1 August that new law about banning mobile phone in the public places is now discussing. Therefore I would like to tell you about dependence between people´s lifestyle and mobile phones. Nowadays you can not do anything without your gadget. People are not only having contact with each other through it, but they have their whole lives in it. Banning mobile phones in all public places will mean that tourists will have no oportunitie for taking pictures of seesights. It will also be more complex for them to find a right way in unknown city without maps on their devices. In the shops and restaurants you will have another problem in addition: nowadays you can even pay with your phone and without having a credit card. By banning mobile phones this innovation can not be used although it is very convenient. Going to the shop people also always write a list with purchasings on their phones. I can understand that people sometimes pay more attention to their gadgets than to the real life. But I think that they have to be taught to make in another way and not by a ban. In my opinion prohobiting mobile phones in all publich places will only displeas people, because they are accustomed to convenient mobile phones which are now a big part of our life. With best regards, Someone

Music had enormous impact on our lives throughtout history, therefore some people claim that it should be taught at school and even students should be obliged to learn to play a musical instrument. In my humble opinion that would not be beneficial to everyone, so such lessons ought not to be obligatory. It seems to me that the most crucial purpose of school cirruculum is to give children vast knowledge of most important subjects like mathematics or biology and I am not completely convinced that music is such a subject. I think that students choose to spend their time on other activities, which might turn out to be more useful to them. Furthermore, some people may not even like to learn playing an instrument. For that reason, they might start to perceive those music lessons as some type of chores and as a result they would learn very ineffectively. Moreover, no one would agrue that learning how to play a musical instrument correctly takes even years so again that would consume quite a large part of students' free time, which they might use in more beneficial way. To top off, I strongly believe that studying music ought not to be compulsory for everyone. I agree on the other hand that if some students want to attend additional music classess, then they should have this possibility.

Studying at a university undoubtedly brings a lot of changes to people's lives. Some students even start to live on their own, while others stay with their family at home. In my humble opinion, both options have some advantages as well as drawbacks. On the one hand, by living on your own you can, without a doubt, obtain useful practical skills or experience. Moreover, you, for sure, will become more adult and independent. What is more, moving out of your family home to another city might give you opportunity to attend more prestigious university. That may particularly concern students who live in small cities or in the countryside. On the other hand, choosing to stay at your family home is probably in all cases much less expensive than this other alternative, because you do not need to worry about the cost of accommodation. Additionally, unless you stay at home, it might be necessary to take up a part-time job to earn some money in order to pay for your new house or for meals. Furthermore, some students might not feel comfortable in another city with lots of unfamiliar people and that might need support of their family. For them it may be more convenient not to move out. To top off, it seems to me that we all, sooner or later, will move out from our family house. For that reason, I believe that not staying at home is far better option, especially if you want to attend a university which is not situated in your town.

This is a great issue to argue. Healthy or wealthy? Both have different advantages and also disadvantages. But will healthy mean wealth? Or will the wealthy mean healthy? For me, being healthy is more important than being wealthy. Healthy means we can productively do such activity. Healthy means we are far from illness. Healthy means we don't need to consume medicine daily. Healthy means we have a great metabolism in our body. There is an argument saying that being rich can make us stay healthy. It is probably right when you have money, you can access health service more easily than if you have a lack of money. However, that is not true, you can access health facilities easily, but money can not cure your illness. Although you have a lot of money, you can not make your illness disappear so suddenly. So, for me, being healthy is more important than being rich. Being healthy can make us work productively and that is enough to fulfill our daily needs.

I totally agree there are a lot of areas which do not have enough doctors due to the inappropriate situations and circumstances such as low salary, a lake of life requirements.

Some parents worry about a negative impact. Video games have some positive effects on their children. Video games are very popular with children. They can make friends by talking about games and playing them. It is not different between playing ground and playing games among children. They can communicate with each other to share an experience. Children can get fulfillment when they complete the game. Mark, he is my cousin, likes to play games. He said that he couldn't concentrate enough without playing games in his childhood. " It might not be a good example, but the fulfillment of completing games gave him confidence." He said. There are many types of games recently. Some games can allow children the opportunity to communicate with other worlds. For example, online chess games are a little different from face to face games. However, it is not easy to play chess if children do not have friends who can play chess. Video games are just one approach to communicate with other worlds. Some games have a negative impact on children. However, there are some positive effects to play video games. If parents understand the details and good points of the games, they can use it positively.

It is not important to be healthy than to be rich. To be rich, you have money and you can afford a lot of things to make your life better like food, clean water, a house to live in, medicine... That money can make your life better. If you are unhealthy, you can come to the hospital and ask the doctor for cure, medicine and that could make you healthy again. You can access to a lot of things and your life will be good. People say you can live 70 years with money than 80-90 year without money. You have no money you can't afford food, clean water and medicine so you can be unhealthy for that. Another reason is you have to work to get money and it will be difficult to work. If you are old then your power won't be too good to work for money.

If you have a conception that the basic principle of all means of communication is spreading a fact or an idea, and into that there is an opinion, it's possible to conclude that this apparatuses are powerful. In the television's case, your invention brought an important new: the power to choose (despite this power were limited by the few options of channels). Because of that, the people didn't need to enjoy, or not, just one channel, but they could make choices about what they wanted watching. Because of that, the television has different powers. It can educate with amazing channels that makes the viwer thinking about several questions, but it can also harm people when channels or advertisements manage to maniputale who is watching. Therefore, who decides what will be the rule of television is the viewer. And this decision is very important.

It is not a modern way to learn about animals from zoos. Many people experienced going to zoos in their childhood. In my memory, almost of animals in zoos were just sitting and lying in their cage with an uneasy face. Nowadays, many TV programs focused on animals in nature, and animals moved lively in the program. It is quite different between animals in zoos and one in nature. I thought that keeping animals in zoos should be stopped and let them belong in nature, after watching such TV programs. The origin of zoos is rare animal collections for an aristocracy. They treated animals as unique objects, not creatures. In present times, people treated animals in zoos as things that tell us the motion of animals in picture books. Being in a cage and being exposed to human sight stressed a lot for animals. It reported that giant panda in a Hong Kong zoo that was long time sterility got pregnant, and the reason for the pregnancy was that pandas could spend their time without any witnesses as of the zoo closure due to the pandemic of COVID-19. This news indicated that human witnesses might be harmful to animals in zoos. Besides, there are many other ways to learn about animals without zoos in modern society. We can learn about animals from books and TV programs and photos of nature magazines. These ways do not harm animals belonging in nature. It is not suitable to hold animals in the cage of zoos. It stressed them and distort their lives. Animals are not playing toys of human. We should treat them as they are in nature.

Secondly, you can connect by using your Facebook account. Hence, you can share your studies process to your news feed. And the last, lessons of Write and Improved are divided into levels. That means you can select a level which is right to you. This is what I like most about this program as well. But, nothing is perfect. Although it's good, there is a problem which makes me not like it so much. It's about its error checking system. Most of the time, it works fine. But, sometimes it's quite confusing. A few days ago, I did a lesson on this program. I quoted a sentence of a celebrity verbatim. Then, it said that it wasn't correct but didn't say what the error was. I tried to check again many times but to no avail. That's what I don't like for this program. In general, this program is still a good choice for people who want to learn English.

People have been arguring about those two things for a long time. Actually, each has its particular benefits. Having the same teacher for several years has advantages that the other doesn't have and vice versa. It's hard to say which one is better but if I had to choose, I would say having new teachers each year is better for students. Why did I say that? Multiple teachers help us see things from different perspectives. They can explain concepts in different ways of understanding and take on topics we feel unqualified to explain. None of these benefits detract from our role as parents and educators, but these partnerships provide opportunities to offer our children more than ever. Have you ever read a book named "Benefits and drawbacks of using multiple instructors to teach single courses" written by Jones, F. & Harris, S? There is a sentence like this: "Multiple instructors working together can be especially effective at meeting high level learning goals." Well, I completely agree with that.

There is no doubt that these days studying musical becoming very popular in schools. However, the question is: Is studying musical good for students ? It is considered one of the most controphersial phenomenon today. In this essay, I am going to exmine this from both viewpoients. On the one hand from the argument there are people who argue that studying music in school considerable benefits outweigh the disadvantages for many reasons. First reason , it is learning the students new skills and they can spend funny time to play on the instrument. The second reason, almost some parents want their children to learn the music because they know leaning music maybe will be a good choancefor their children in future to earn extra money. On the other hand, people who cliam that studying music is not very important . They believe that it is lost for time and effort and they also think it is extra and their children can learn it any time . These people believe there other subjects more useful for their children to learn it in school more than musicl does. As we have seen, there is no one easy answer to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that studying music is very interesting if the students want that, so I think studying music good to be elective class for students who interest to learn it.

The experience of studying abroad at young ages is the advantage. Recently, studying abroad is not an uncommon experience for ordinary people. Some parents are eager to let their children go to another country to study language and culture in that country. On the other hand, it is said that studying abroad with no purpose is meaningless. In my opinion, it is a useful experience for young people to go to another country and learn about their culture. It allowed them the opportunity to see the world from another perspective. People who live in another country should learn about language and culture, which usually is not familiar to them. It might be hard to understand all of them. However, they can achieve another perspective by touching new thought and culture, and that is a strong advantage to live. If they do not go familiar with another culture, the experience of studying abroad might be the worst memory. It is not easy to have friends and a reliable person casually in a foreign country. The sense of failure and unfruitful memory frustrated them after returning home. Anyway, studying abroad can be a positive challenge for young people. If you can get such experience at young ages, you have the advantage already. The best teacher in life is their own experience.

The way to travel in the future will be so different, maybe we're going to start having holidays on the space, and that's not science fiction, there's a project called holidays in the space, recently a rocket go though the space, it was amazing, even if you were watching it on TV, there will be more ways to travel that help the enviroment , like cars that can travel with solar light as fuel.

In my opinion, learning forgeign language is more important today than it was in the past. Today, people have money, they travel to another country for jobs, vacation.... Local people from one country want to have different national customers. The customers that live in another country is mean that they are rich. They can invest a lot of money to a project. If you try to learn a new language, you can easily to communicate with forgeiner customers. You can understand more about what they say and you don't need to spend money to hire a translator. A translator can be a spy from enemy company and they can tranlate to a different idea. In the past, customers or travelers are few. They don't have enough money to travel to a different country so it is less important to learn a foreign language.

In my opinion, I think that school should replace the computers and tablets for books. Books are hard to find in the library. It is very thick and it is easy to be destroy by tearing and pouring water into. Students can't read a book in the dark without light, but computers and tablets can. Computers and tablets can light up the screen by the light inside it. Tablets and computers can also find book for you online. For example, the book that you want to read is not in your school's library, so you can't read it. But tablets and computers can search the book for you. It can search every book online for you and you don't need to worry about having no books to read. Tablets can also translate new word for you online so you can concentrate on reading books.

There are a big diversity of subjects we have at school. Some of them we like and other ones we hate. But do we really need all these subjects at school? A good example of subject which importance is often discussed is mucis class. On he one hand only two or tree pupiles from each class do something related to music in their later life, but everyone has to endure music classes during the school time. For some children who have no talent for it, it is very difficult not to fail in this subject. It is also not fair when some students are doing music in their free time and another only have one lesson a week at school. In such sitiuation some students have advantages and better grades only because their parents sent them to music school or because their parents can play some instrumets themselves and can learn their children too. On the other hand some parents even come to the idea of sending their child to play piano, so this student will never find out whether he likes it or not. And by having music classes at school some students can discover a new subjects and maybe even find a new hobby. And it is the function of school: to bring children to new spheres which can interest them. To sum up I think that schools have to offer music classes, but do not need to make them compulsory till the end of school, but for example only till fifth grade.

These days the majority of university students prefer to live with their families when they study., and other students appel to move to live alone or with their firends. I complately agree with students who prefer to move and live on their own whearas they are students. Firdt of all, It is often argued that moving to live away from family is more advantageous to students who want to complete their studies for two main reasons . First reason , these students will be more depentance on themselves more than they were. The second reason, many of studies and research shows that students who live alone or on their own are more confidant from themselves than students who live wither families. For instance, univerisite students ,who live away, will try new experience and learn new things which they will explore it by themselves. That is why moving to live away from family is very important especially during studying university which help them to be dependent and confidant in life Secondally, living alone or away from families assist in many aspect for students to be successful in their life. For that, the majority of parents encourage their children to pursue their goals even if their goals were in another area because they already know this way is very advantagous for their children in their future life. The good illustration here is the new studies which prove that students who move to live away from their families can afford the responsibalites in the future especially in their jobs and they are more successful in their life.

Video games are good or bad for children? People have asked this question for such a long time. Some people believe that it's good, others believe the opposite. In my opinion, it has both positive and negative effects. Positive effects? According to Ted Talk, video games have many positive effects. First: Problem and solving logic. When a child play games like Flappy Bird, he trains his brain to come up with creative ways to solve puzzles and other problems in short bursts. Next: Accuracy. Action games train the player's brain to make fast decisions without losing accuracy. As you can see, video games give children positive effects. However, too much of anything is just too much.

Most medical doctors study this field because they like to achieve a good prestige and earn high money. The rural regions are always suffering from lack of health care and professionals. There are some specific reasons for this problem. First of all, there is not enough money in the rural regions. Since most rural areas are located in the peripheral and most of them live in poverty. So, they cannot afford the costs of medicine system. In addition, the government does not support these regions. Most rural areas have forgotten in the policies and public plans. As a result, the government does not know about the situation. In my opinion, the government must pay more attention to the rural areas and prepare plans to improve their situation, especially in the health system. Also, it must make a compulsory rule for medical doctors to work in the peripheral regions for a couple of years. Moreover, support them to earn enough money to remain their motivation. In conclusion, although working in the rural areas is more difficult for medical doctors, there are some solutions to make them satisfaction and develop the rural life condition.

In some countries, schools have a music course for all students. But, other countries may disagree with music or they could not be able to provide musical instruments. In my opinion, we need to consider music as a practical course for students. But, it would be better to take students a chance to choose it by themselves. The first reason is, music can imorove their mental and physical situation. For instance, music makes people feel peace and happiness. The whole history of world is full of different kinds of music and musical instruments which have brought beauty for individuals. Another reason for using music course is developing students' talents and potentials. In other words, they could be able to find their skills in music and would follow it in the future as a career. In conclusion, it would be better to have a music course in our schools, but it would be an optional choices. Personally, I would always love to have a chance to try a specific musical instrument.

Going to the university could change people lifestyle. Most students would decide to move and start a new life in a different way. On the Other hand, some prefer to stay with their family as the same. In my opinion, moving away and living on your own has some advantages. The first main reason is, by living alone you can achieve independancy. It means, you can make a decision by your own and control your life without any interference. The other one, living away would provide you for the future. You can start learning how can earn money and manage your costs. Also, you have a chance to face the tough situations and find the solutions. On the other hand, some people believe students must stay with their family in order to lack of the security in society. But, in my point, students must learn earlier how protect themselves. In conclusion, students could see the life at university as an opportunity to learn how to live on their own. It helps them to live better in the future.

These days, Students need to take some volunteer work before they graduate . This system is required in almost of high schools. I completely agree with this requirement to work as a volunteer . First of all, volunteering work learns students enormous things and information which they are not try it or know it before. When the students volunteer to work in charities places to help poor people or old people all these works will change students thinking and believes to the better by making them be more cooperative because they send their time and effort without any wage. Doctors, for example, are from the most people who provide volunteering not just their work as a doctor request that from them, but they know the poor, the old and the ills people need the doctors' assists . To illustrate, the poor people do not have enough money to pay for the hospital, and most old people cannot go to the hospital. So that is why volunteering work is important for students before they graduate which makes them help other people. Secondly, in every major the volunteering work has advantageous for both the students and the companies or the volunteering place. There are many institues , companies, universities and shelters need a lot of employees but they cannot pay for them high wage or their budgets connot afford to pay for new empployees. So the best solution here is volunteering work . That assist these places to provide the best services for people . The good illustration here is shetlers which need voluntering people to help the shetler's center to provide enough services for poor people who come from other countries due to war or other reasons . Thus , volunteering is a good choice to comlete the lack of needs. In conclusion, I strongly believe that volunteering works is very important for all students to learn and try new experiences.

Zoos are good or cruel for animals? A sensitve question, right? When you ask someone, he may say they're good. But then, you ask another person with the same question and he gives the opposite answer. So who is right? In my opinion, I prefer the opposite, which means they're not good for animals. First, animals should be free, not be jailed. Imagine that you're an animal. You're living in the wilderness and one day, you're captured and put into a cage. You can't do anything. You're separated from your own fellow, you spend the whole day going around inside the cage. How would you feel about that? Secondly, it's about the zoos. Well, some zoos take care of the animals in a bad way. They don't feed them, even mistreat them. That's the second reason why I don't like zoos. And you say that they're good places to learn about animals? If it were years ago, it may be true. But now, look around us. Smartphones, social medias are everywhere. We can search for anything on the Internet. It describes it even more detail. So why do we need zoos? For something else? For any reasons, it won't change my mind.

One aspect of having a good job is its place. I think people need to feel convenient at work. In my opinion, it absolutely depends on the form of job. I will explain my reasons to provide a good answer. First of all, in the enormous companies it is better to enclose the place. Because people who work in a huge building must deal with a lot of people. In addition, separate walls could increase disciplines and specify their duties. On the other hand, with an open design they would lose their privacy. Also, in these kinds of companies providing security is more difficult than small offices. On the other hand, open design is appropriate for small offices. By removing walls people can feel the sincerity with each other. In an open place, colleagues and their employees can work as a team and it helps them to increase their skills together. But, it can put their privacy en danger. In conclusion, each type of design has cons and pros. But, it is important to know which one is better for them. We can use both kinds in a specific situation.

I would like to begin with the second question. In my opinion it may be a problem for economic situation. The doctors want to be in the citis because they can be in the middle of cultural and social life. In the cities are more possibilities for education. On the other hand the neighborhood is anonymous.

I believe that television can educate. In fact, television today has some channels, series or films which educate a lot. Today you can see so many different channels that could entertain you, like comedy films or series. Although these types of films are underestimated they also give us so many life lessons. For example, letting children watch cartoons can teach them how to love, to be friends, or even find something they don't know. Every type of TV programs educate in a specific topic. Documentaries teach you what to do in case of an attack by a predator, or survive in a storm, tsunami and other types of bad weather. There are TV series which tell you how to do something, like cooking special foods or how to do a beautiful birthday party.

In conclusion, I agree with the fact that the TV can educate us.

Dear Teacher, The new school year has arrived. The last one has passed quite well for me but it was not enough. There are several things that I haven't fulfied yet. So, in this year, I'll try my best to do it well. But first, let me answer the question about the areas of my learning I'm pleased with. They are Mathematics, Communication and language. They are the areas that I have enjoyed since I was a kid. Well, I also want to improve my Communication and language, especially English. I'm still not good at Speaking and Listening. This is the first thing made me unsatisfied with myself over the last school year. The second thing is my Literacy. I have to admit that it is still bad. So I have to improve it. And how will I do to archieve my goals? Try my best. It's the best I can do.

I started to use Write and Improve a few months ago I find this web site because I was studying English in another website and that website recommended me that if I wanted to improve my skills I should try this, and I tried it so I used W&I as a complement for my grammar classes and put in practise all I learned in past classes and after I do this then I figured out that isn't easy to make sentences with your own knowledge and for me that's how you improve because you start to try it and if you don't know you start to searching for information and start over once more. The first time I couldn't understand how to use it, but actually it's very easy and the tools that this website has are very usefulness, you've feedback once you finish a lesson.

For me, the best holiday is the trip to Hueco Mundo last summer. I went with my family and some of my friends. We chose this destination because we heard that it was one of the most must-go countries in the world. It was also where my brother had been learning so we wanted to visit him as well. Rumors is indeed not wrong. It was gorgeous, more than you could imagine. The beauty of Hueco Mundo was unbelievable: The buildings with glittering lights, the incredibly clean streets and so on. The food was really good too. It was simple with rice, vegetables, some meat just like we had in our country but it tasted delicously. We stayed at a hotel on the capital. The next day, we visited our brother about 5 kilometers away. He took us to many places: museums, galleries, etc. We learnt many things: culture, custom, clothes,... We stayed there for more 2 days and the last day, we got on the plane and went home. It was the best holiday for me. I not only had a lot of fun but also learned many useful things.

Be healthy is importance as you get older. Some people work hard all their life to earn money then they ignore they selfl care both physical and mental health. Therefore, this could lead to spending their earmng income to cure a sickeness, instead of preparing for their retirement. In my opinion taking care of your health and your wealth are crucial for living. Why wealth is necessary. As we live in a capitalism society so money could provide a high standard of living, therefore getting rich is the intimate goal for most people. Wealth is a major supporter for optimum health because it gives you the financial freedom to make healthy choices and avail of any existing health and fitness resources. Unfortunately, in our market place today, the healthier food choices are more expensive than the damaging processed varieties. This is why wealth is also our freedom of our financial security. In contrast, betterrhealth is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people.

I think the two ways have benefits because if you've the same teacher a few years he'll be able to help you in specific ways like in what topics you need more help and which ones you don't and the way that he should teach and everyone can understand him, although this can cause some kind of boring since every class can turn into a repetition of the other classes. However if you have a different teacher every year this allow you to learn different technics and tricks to learn new things from the new teacher since that new teacher has some new methods to teach even so this can turn bad because that new teacher doesn't know how the students are and he won't know how find the best way to help them and improve the knowledge of every single student. Finally, I'd prefer a new teacher every year, I think that's the best way to improve for me.

We often watch TV news on elderly woman living close to 120 years, with reporters asking her the secret of healthy living. We cannot deny that recent development in medical fields has dramatically risen average life span. However, I do not value highly of those news reports, as shorter but intense lives should be more meaningful. Firstly, not so many 80 or 90 years old people can afford to live on their own, forcing their sons or daughters to support their daily lives. Although living together makes family bonds stronger, it must be a burden for younger generations to support their parents while working or raising their children. Some even spend their last ten years of life hospitalized, which accompanies tremendous medical costs. In no way should lives without health be happy. Secondly, having shorter lives may be a motivation for younger generations to appreciate their lives well. Despite having adequate free time, some businessmen waste their time and just stay home on weekends idlelly. As most people spend their twenties through sixties working at the same company, such activities as doing hobbies or travelling on weekends are indispensable to avoid mundane lives. Shorter time after retirement encourages younger generations to seek what leads them to spend their time happily. For these two reasons, I believe not having excessively long life span should be a shortcut to spending meaningful life.

Have you ever wondered: What will our travel look like in the future? We will still travel the same say as we do now? My prediction: It may be different. We may travel faster, safer and it less impact on the environment. At present, you can see that there are so many problems about travel: emissions, traffic jams, traffic accidents,... Therefore, many scientists, engineers start to think about how to change our travel. They are working, testing to create new vehicles to minimize the problems I mentioned before. Several ideas, projects have been introduced. In 2017, Elon Musk showed his project on Hyperloop, a proposed model of passenger and freight transportation. He also conducted a test and it worked. I know, there will be many concerns surrounding this project but it's still a positive signal for our future travel. I guess you have heard about flying car. Many protoypes have been built since the early of the 20th century. Most recently, a flying car named Cezeri was first introduced and it worked fine. There are still many other projects, ideas to change our future travel. Hope it will become true.

Medicine is an ardous work to do because doctors not only have to spend many hours on guard but also they have to study hard to become a good professional. That is the reason why a lot of doctors want to work in a good hospital in cities instead of rural areas; this problematic causes that there are not enough doctors there. Besides, lack of doctors in rural areas is because those doctors who have to go there; they have to leave their family or friends and the life cost is difficult because there are no facilities that a city provides. Also, an important reason for doctors is the delay and lack of adequate equipment to work correctly and developing their job in a good way. The presented reasons are the cause why doctors don't want to do their practicum or work in those kinds of areas. Some quick fixes for this problematic situation that affects averyone could be provided to the rural doctor a better payment to be there. But, if hospitals and rural areas can't afford an upper salary, the rural community and the place where doctors go should make as more comfortable as they can. Rural communities could try to adapt accepatable places to doctors not only for their stancy but also to work correctly with adequate devices, having as a result more doctors' work application for those kinds of places.

With the current pace of people lifestyle in this generation, an activity that links to our life at rest is continuously rising from the existence of technology and all the services with attempts to obtain profit from our laziness. As a result thereof, do we need to encourage a more active lifestyle by enforcing mandatory sporting classes in the school curriculum? I fully disagree with this question, and two reasons are accounted for regarding this. Firstly, every student possesses their time schedule which is varied and different in each person. Including three classes of sport each week can possibly consume an excessive amount of time that one can utilise in a way that is beneficial for their living. Some student, for example, may need to be a part-timer in order to gain enough money for their tuition; or giving every vacant timeslot possible to their valuable one can be a case for some as one of my friends, whom her mother has an Alzheimer's disease, that tries to reduce the cost of hiring nurse for her mother. Secondly, although one decides to not doing any sport, this does not guarantee that one has an inactive life since several activities can do this duty in lieu. Gardening, housework, or grocery shopping are considered as activities that demonstrate the usage of a large amount of energy and the increased human stamina. Instead of compelling students to do sport, which can possibly lead to hatred in sporting, if educational institutions recommend an activity that can potentially incorporate with students daily life for an improved active lifestyle such as using stairs instead of the elevator, this may be a more appropriate choice for many. To summarise, why mandatory sport class, personally, expresses disagreement: the existence of a personal timetable and a plethora of sports-substituted activities in order to achieve an active lifestyle.

Learning a non-mother language is a hard work. Even, in this generation, many artificial intelligence has been created to translate languages from around the world, personal communication skills in a foreign language is still important in our life, there are two outstanding reasons to support this idea. Fisrt, being a multilinguist is more advantage. Students who can speak a foreign language fluently tends to achieve better school and college. Most people feel more comfortable communicating with us people than computers or robots; so, we would choose to communicate with one who understand us first. Speaking in the same language, we can work faster. Second, there are still people who cannot use other than their primary language. Being able to communicate in a secondary language, we would be able to contact them properly. Language translator or dictionary consume time. Therefore, these are reasons why I think learning to speaking a foreign language is as important these days s it was in the past.

Musical activities are important to develop imagination and creative skills. Music is an essential part of evryone's life because human beings since the bassinet hear sound, music or melodies like lullabies or different kinds of sounds. That is the reason why people since kindergarten begin to learn or to play an instrument, being the reason why schools add music in their schoolars framework. Nowadays, a lot of schools have in their schedules music classes per week in order to give cultural knowledge, distraction and to develop abilities in students. Besides, students have the opportunity to discover if music is a hidden talent to develop and starting to practise and imporving musical abilities. I personally consider that music is an essential part of people's life so all students should study music at least once in their life because this activity allows them to find a way for distraction or to find their passion. To summarize, people who have had music classes in their academic life are able to manage stress better. They also have had the opportunity to discover something new and to take a break from stressful routines or simple the daily lifestyle.

I disbelieve to the claim that doctor want to work in cities for money. Yes , It is the fact that in cities doctor get more wages than in any rural areas. But it is not for the money but for facility that is no there in rural areas. Doctor have most heptic schedule and they don't get enough time for rest and supposed doctor gets to work in rural areas where there is no infrastructure and facilities so how can doctor make mind focus towards his work only. There is lot to change in rural areas and first thing to do is to work on infrastructure so that there can be scope of making new hospital. People in rural areas are not knowledgeable enough to recognize the importance of medical science . There are a lot of incident happened in recent that support the fact that doctors in village are not safe. Though people believe doctors are god but when the purpose is not fulfilled they do not hesitate to show their anger to doctors in the form of phycial violence. Also people in villages do not prefer to go to hospital ,they prefer either local remedies or they involved themselves in dark magic.

Well both have their own advantages and disadvantages. First start with the open design in which there is no partition and everything is spacious while in enclosed workstations there is small partition which is present for the privacy. I personally like spacious place where I do not feel suffocating and can think freely watching the different things which helps in getting the ideas . Also there is not an easy task to just sit over one place bounded with small space . Now as the time advances we are moving towards working together and for that open design is must. Many big companies like Google, facebook etc they preferred to use spacious environment where all can interact with each other and can get the helpful ideas from everybody . Now open environment is necessary for all the office not because it helps in work life but it also affect the mental health. To maximize the output from the employees many companies are now considering and focusing on mental health and physical health because if employees are not fit from inside there is no chance that they can give the company their full potential serivce. Environment affect the mental and physical health. Where you sit, where you eat, where you work . all matters .

Some students like to have the same teacher for severeal years because in this way, they can have a kind of affection and it is very easy to cope with a person that you know very well. Some learners feel more comfortable when their teacher become a close person. On the other hand, having a lot of teachers can be better, because it is a way to learn different things from different people in very different manners. Every person has an individual way to explain, and when something is very hard for us understanding, maybe it will be easy when another person explains the same.

What is really important is that you are able to choose someone that can explain well and you can understand and enjoy the learning moment and not only memorize things.

That is a hard reality, but always fewer medical doctors decide to work in the rural areas where a high rate of deseaes and ills are expected over the next decades. This is an aptitude related to different social and economic issues, most of them affecting our modern society. The most impressive is the lack of good willing and the bad aptitude to help others. Rural areas are becoming more and more crowded after many people make a comeback in the countryside, where some new diseases are unfortunately spreading. New jobs are spreading in different areas but it does not seem to interest young medical doctors. It is not difficult to guess the reasons, first of all we are speaking about areas involved with famine, wars, draughts and every kind of risky situations that does not help to persuade doctors. Another important point is that rural areas are cut off from the most important places of a city and they often are not provided with the most essential services; the last but not least it takes long to get a city. Some solutions are going to be thought to improve the situation, like better means transport system or the building of new facilities that simplify doctors lives in rural areas. Some new services at doctors disposal is not the only solution. The economic crises make people poorer, it means they do not have enough money to afford detailed and suitable cure. IAs I see it, governments should made sensitive-based decisions like funding hospitals in ruaral areas and let a raise of payment at the doctors.

I think that computers and tablets shouldn't replace books, because when you look too much time or the tablet it can hurt your eyes, books don't hurt your eyes and are made of paper, and books improve your redaing skills. Sometimes tablets can distract kids, instead of paying attention to the class, but books don't cause distraction. Books are made for kids to be ineterested in learning about different subjects, but if the tablets are replaced by books, the tablets can sometime had bad connection, the tablets can run out of battery, or the tablets can sometimes be very bad and they can break. If the books were replaced by tablets and computers, the school would have to pay for the computers and tablets, and for a good internet coonnection which can be very expensive sometimes. That is why I think books should stay.

Hi Anna, I hope you're well. How was your weekend? My weekend was good. I went to see a movie called Parasite on Saturday and I'm so excited to share my experience with you. It is a thriller movie. Now I can say it is one of my favourite films so far. The movie is about two different types of families. One is a poor family and another one is a rich family. The movie illustrates the different life of two families in a sarcastic way. Common manipulative behaviour such as lying, sneaking are well portrait in this movie. If you want to watch something different from what you have watched so far, don't forget to add Parasite on your 'must-watch' list.

Have you ever wondered: "What will the school of the future look like? Will it neither still be the same or different?" From my point of view, along with the development of the world, I think the school in the future will change in many ways. First, as you can see, laptops and smartphones are present more. In the future, traditional classes where teacher sit at the table and share their knowledge will change. Online classes with modern devices will replace them gradually. Secondly, it's about the knowledge. The present one is quite old, obsolete, not commonly used anymore. Everyone knows that. Therefore, researchers, scientists, educationalists,... have started to change it. Finally, school building and infracstructure. Technological developments will definitely impact them. There will be a lot of modern devices in school such as Smart Touch White Board, Reading Pod, etc. In a nutshell, the school in the future will go along with the development of technology. We can't say if it's good or bad but it will definitely be interesting.

Children are spending the most of their time in video games nowadays. In my opinion, this situation has negative impact on them. Although it is a fun activity, more and more kids are showing health problems such as obesity and sight problems. Another serious problem is about social interacion, children don't go play outside anymore because they are very busy trying to fight against a great villain and to help their favourite super hero to save the world. On another hand, parents feel more comfortable when their kids are playing inside because they think it is safer and they can do other things that they want to without worrying about being interrupted. To sum up, video games can be really fun and very useful to entertain children in a simple and safe way. However, it is necessary to take notice of how much time children are spending on it and to observe that they are only allowing that their lives are getting ahead in front of their through a screen from a computer or from a cell phone.

Honestely animals for me belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. My thought is if you were an animal you would like to stay locked in a prison? I wouldn't . Actually we are living and a moment delicate of our existence because of covid-19 for this reason we are in locked down so these past month bring to us that stay locked inside home isn't a good experience . So the same form is for that animals they belong in nature so when a person take off them of your nature habita and keep them in zoos is a bad person. But thinking in other side of history for kids learn about animals is good because the experience for them is gonna be so much better then an experience inside a class room .

If this seems familiar to you, Write and Improve might be the perfect tool for you to step up your writing skill and to impress others with your writing talent. I recently discovered their site, which is not only easy accessible but also completely free to use. How does this tool work and, more importantly, is it worth trying? The website, provided with a clear and neat interface, consists of different workbooks with writing exercises. Whatever level of English you have, there will be an appropriate workbook task for you. You can hand in your writing and you will receive immediately detailed feedback. Moreover, there is a timer function and a graph to track your writing progress. Hence, in my opinon, this tool is really beneficial to your language skills. The immediate checks make you more aware of the mistakes you make. In addition, the site provides you with advice on how to improve. To me, this tool was indeed really helpful for preparing for my camebridge exam. However, it should be noted that the website doesn't mark all your spelling mistakes nor grammatical errors. Therefore, it would be wise to also ask a teacher to check your work, instead of just relying on the tool. Likewise, sometimes they give unclear feedback, which make it difficult to improve even more. Despite the tool not always working properly, I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their writing. To practice is the key to any skill and Write and Improve creates a great online learning environment for doing so. So, why don't you give it a go?

Television, a media appeared in the 1950s, is one of the most important inventions that changed our lives. Everyone knows that the main purpose of a television is entertaining. But have you ever wondered: "Can it also educate?" From my point of view, it definitely can. How can a television educate? By the programs shown on it. When I was a kid, there was an educational program shown every morning. It lasted for 30 minutes and it provided some Math lessons for children. Nowadays, more and more programs produced to teach students Math, Geography, Science,... Even cartoons can play that role. For example, Tom and Jerry teach children how to be a good guy. As you can see, now we are dealing with COVID-19. Students can't go to school. Therefore, in many countries, televisions are used to teach the students while they're at home. In a nutshell, there's no way that a television can't educate. Television has the potential to do that. It depends on the way we use it.

Nowadays, most students decide to study overseas for a while. Studying in another country has some pros and cons, and I will argue both sides in this essay. The main reason to choose studying abroad is broadening your horizons. People who go abroad could gain the new experiences and face a new culture to deal with. For example, students who are living overseas could learn to adapt themselves with the new situations and think more rationally about their surroundings. Secondly, moving away helps students to learn a new language and give them a good opportunity to research with a large range of references. Moreover, dealing with a new language increases their brain capacity as well. Turning to the other side of the argument, there are some drawbacks to study abroad. The main disadvantage is culture shock. Students might face a new people who are not familiar with them and this makes them feel lonely. This is not possible for them to cope with this new condition easily. The other problem must be mentioned is, students have to start from scratch. It means, they must start a new life and it is possible that they have to live with low money at first. Also, they might get a student loan to pay university fees. In conclusion, although there are some considerable pros in moving away to study, there are some disadvantages to consider carefully. Living abroad could open students' mind and also, improve their language skills. On the other hand, they might not adopt themselves with new place quickly and also, have difficult financial problems.

Television is one of the most popular tools for amusing people also, for teaching new things in the world. In my opinion, the side of entertaining people outweigh the educational aims. The main aim of TV is broadcasting entertaining programs. Firstly, people want to be amazed. For example, there are a lot of movie genres like the comedy, the action and the TV shows on television that can make a lot of fun for individuals and help them to relax after a hard day. Secondly, television is extremely cheaper than going to the cinema or theater. Finally, people like watching favourite celebrities such as, actors or actresses, sportsmen or sportswomen and singers on TV. On the other hand, educationally, there are some programs which are designed for students and helped them based on their curriculums. The other reason is related to have a good access to TV for poor people. And the final reason for using television for educating is lower costs of the educational programs. In conclusion, although people watch TV to enjoy their time, they can learn at their free time.

The educational environment is a major concern when people decide where to study. So, many students prefer to study abroad because of many advantages. However, there are still inevitable drawbacks when studying in foreign countries. On the one hand, studying abroad is beneficial. If a student goes to a foreign country to study, he or she will approach to a new culture. Students will see a lot of stuff which they have not seen before. So that they can learn new things and might end it up with new ideas, which can be applied to their nations. Besides, studying abroad might be a good way to advertise the human resources of the nation. Students who represent their countries to go abroad might attract foreign investments and collaboration by showing their talent, making friends, and working to help the country they are studying. Since then, they can contribute to the development of their countries. On the other hand, studying abroad might bring some disadvantages. Firstly, intellectual losses are a big concern. Many talented students who study oversea will never come back to their nations after finishing their programs because they will receive more benefits when working for a foreign country they study. Secondly, it might take a large amount of money when studying abroad. Many students cannot afford that. There are still many drawbacks such as language barriers, cultural shock.

Many species of animals are kept in zoos where people can visit and learn about them. In over the world, this kind of place is very common, moreover it is a tourist place where people spend all day seeing the animals in their cages. In my opinion, animals belong in nature and it is not a good idea to keep them in zoos because in this way they do not have freedom and they depends on human beings to reproduce and even to eat. On the other hand, some species would be extinct if man did not do anything to keep them alive due to ecological balance that it has been caused by the humans. To sum up, I do not agree with animals in zoos for entertainment people, but we need to do something for help the animals. Human beings are on the top of food chain, but it is very important to know how to protect animals and live with them in this world that is being destroyed by humans.

Nowadays video games are very popular especially for the children. They were born during 90's, becoming more and more popular in the following years. The secret behind this success has different reasons; the first reason is the amount of different games that we currently have, starting from football games up to war games; the second reason is about the graphics, in fact nowadays video games are become very similar to the true life in terms of charachters and scenaries. Their success has brought many problems in our life especially for parents, in fact they attract the attention of the children more and more easy. I think that a right amount of this games could be good for the children because in this way they can stay away from something to danger, like drugs for example, and at the same time playing with them can learn children how to face the life challenges. On the other hand using video games too much could be dangerous for children in terms of healthy. A negative aspect regards the effects of some games on the children that can bring a negative influence on their behavior. I think parents have the responsibility to check children as well as possible in order to let them to play with video games but not too much. In my opinion we need to learn children that a read a book is always much better than play with video games.

Nowadays doing exercises is becoming more and more popular. Many studies have shown that a reasonable amount of exercise can improve your healthy, so more and more people is starting to change their habits. I held a class discussion on the importance of this topic just few days ago. There were a lot of different opinions about this topic especially how to do them and if they were the most important thing in the life. This is always a tricky problem, because like everything in the life the important thing is the balance. If you spend the whole day to do exercises you will not have time for your family, for your girlfriend or boyfriend and for your friends. If you spend your time only for exercise probably you will always lose something in terms of friendship or love. On the other hand if you don't dedicate a bit of your time for exercises you damage your helathy in particular when you become older. For these reasons, as I said before, the secret in this tricky problem is the balance, so in other words you have to take time for yourself but also for your affects.

However, there is a growing demand for doctors in rural areas that it is not possible to reach. There are many reasons that explained this tendency along several proposals to tacke it. One of the biggest problems is the medicine is evolving dramatically. As a result, doctors need to be up to date, and for this, they should study at universities or colleges that are always located in cities. On the other hand, doctors have to compete for a place to be a consultant, while there are only a few places available, and these places are highly competitive.

Type or paste your text here... in my opinion it always important but it depends on what language you like to learn for example in those days the English language it's very important. But if you would like to learn a language just, a few people use it. It will waste your time. So in my opinion you have to learn English. And if you would like to learn an extra language, you need at first to know how many people speak this language. And is it easy or not this important thing because if the language hared you will take a lot of time to learn and this maybe not good. So in my opinion, if you would like to learn a new language look at famous language and easier language for your mother language. I will explain my mother's language is Arabic so for my English language it's okay not hared and not easy too. But if my mother language is Korean for me the English language will be so hard.

Having the same teacher for several years it is good for students, some believe that on the other hand others think having new teachers each year is more beneficial. In my opinion, I think the best one is having a new teacher each year. The first reason this is better for the student to learn from different methods of study type to know what is the best way to learn from it. and prepare themselves to fit with changes, because in the real-life will be live in a world changed every day there is nothing constant. Every day new things appear and things disappear. Seconde this help them to know more things, because maybe the teacher whose teach them he didn't tell them about a topic because he also doesn't know. Third it is good to change the environment and the students don't stay everyday see this teacher or that this makes the student feel bored, because there is nothing new will happen today they start to know the routine and the next action for the teacher even before he starts to do it. Maybe this method has some negative but in my opinion still better than the others believe.

It is very important when someone is learning a new language, he or she can has contact with not only the language, but also the culture and living abroad is a great experience for anyone who wants to learn about the language and the culture of another country. On the other hand, students who choose to study abroad can lose some opportunities in their country. Students can redo their school year because the subject in another country is totally different and perhaps a student from university school can miss a job opportunity in that year that he is travelling. To sum up, it is a great chance when someone can study overseas. It is not an opportunity that all people can afford it because it is very expensive and even if students can stop their lives for one year or more, it will be a terrific experience and it will be very important for their resumé and personal experience.

Nowadays doctors are not tempted to move into the country as they were back in the day. Cities are no dirty places anymore and instead physicians are greeted with a generous income and a wide offer of free-time activities. But essentially there are more potential patients in a rather tight space, allowing the doctors to abandon long trips to bedridden patients. As a result you don't waste too much time driving around, which you could also use to cure even more patients in a day. You see: money is the cue. To solve the problem of doctor-shortage in the country you have to attract physicians by securing them extra help by the authoroties. For instace you could offer them special conditions for the building process of their doctor's offices. Alternatively they could be provided with lower running taxes or prices for their equipment. Another option would be to give more places at universities to aspiring students of medicine who consent to work for a certain period in rural areas after their studies.

There are people don't like it, because they think that animals suffer a lot when they don't live in her natural environment. I'm not agree with them. The animal grow up in a good environment, they have a fair treat. They born, grew up and die in the zoo. when you go to the zoo, you learn a lot of things about lifestyle of animals and you learn to respect them. I think the damage to the animals is very low if you compare benefits. There are many animals that are suffering because they live in a circle, and you cannot compare them. The animals in circle have wrong lifestyle and the animals defenders thinks there are the same.

In this new school year I will be very pleased with learning about English Literature and about grammar. Grammar is my favourite subject and I will really appreciate about studying it, since it is a very difficult area of knowledge for many students and even teachers have some difficulties about that. Besides that, I would like to improve my writing and my pronunciation about the English language. It is very hard for a foreign student to learn a second language and now, in this program, I have the opportunity to do that. To sum up, in order to achieving my goals I will do my best and I will study hard as well. I would like to enjoy this opportunity and I am sure that it will be a long way to improve my skills, but I know that I can do it and with this help definitely it will be easier and I will certainly develop my skills for sure.

The best holiday that I ever had was in January in 2006. My husband and I have decided get married in this month because we wanted to celebrate our engagement in our parents' town since we had been living 6 hours far from them. Another reason to choose the date and the place was because we had a lot of friends in common that spent that holiday with their relatives. All our friends were gone to another city to work, so we could meet them in holidays and vacations. It was an amazing party, with all our family and most of our friends. I wore a beautiful dress and my husband and I invited 400 people. After the party we spent the night in a hotel and we had lunch with our family in the same place where the party happened because a lot of people had lunch with us. After some days, we went back to our apartment and now almost 15 years after, we live in a nice house, in another city, with two daughters and one fish.

In our country,Myanmar,it takes time the teachers to be changed to one school from another. Because they have to serve at the same school for about four or five years to be promoted . So, I rarely experience being taught by different teachers. I don't know well the differences between having new teachers and the same teacher each year. I believe that both have positive and negative effects. For some students, they like having the same teacher for several years because they are accustomed to his or her teaching methods and they like it. But, to be honest, I really would like to be taught by new teachers each year. In my opinion, having new teachers will give us something new to learn. For example,supposing we do not like the teacher now teaching, then we can expect another one is better next year and his or her teaching methods may be way better or may be more fun. As I mentioned before ,we could learn something different from her and she can attract us to be interested in the school lessons,I think. On the other hand,the new teacher might be worse at teaching . However, I like to be having new teacher each year as I wish to be taught with different teaching ways by different teachers .

There is no doubt that volunteer work those days have became a famous work as people became more sensitive and carrying about the people around them. However, the question is; is it suitable to have volunteer work as a requiremnt for graduating from high school? In this essay I am going to discuss this penomenen from both point of views. Ob one hand of the argument, we have people who argue that forcing our children to volunteer is considerably a bad thing to do. People believe that the essence of volunteer work lies in our intention. For instance, some students might not be willing to volunteer so when we make them work arbitrarily they are going to hate it and in this casewe lose what really is the meaning of this work, which is to give all you could uncondotionally and with passionat. Moreover, on the other hand people argue that making our students work vulonteerly could benefit many people and in the same time we teach our students to have loads of experience in such field, which will benefit them in the long-run. Good example here is that they will learn how to be patient, control time and to respect people. learning this work skiils would make you life easier. Eventually, we could say that forcing our students may not be the right decision. Instead, we could tell them the importance of this worl and leave it alternative.

Living in the twenty first century, the age of IT,all the children play video games except the poor of the poorest. Because the poor can't afford to buy video games facilities. Video games are frowned on by parents as time-waster,and worse,some education experts think that these games corrupt the brain. It can affect children's development and health when it is played exceedingly. Some experts said that some young people become violent or commit extreme anti-social behaviour because of playing games. Some children spend their times playing game alone in their own room instead of hanging out with friends. It can affect his cognitive development unless he go out and socialize the real world. This can also impair his eyesight. Contrary to the common view,video games have some positive effects when it is played moderately. There are many types of games made for varied purposes —some can be entertaining and relaxing while others can be challenging and good for learning. Some games can improve children's development such as making decision in a short period of time and critical thinking skills. It seems to me that parents should not forbid children playing games. Instead they can help them enjoy video games properly and avoid problems.

Dear Mayor, Dear Membres of the Town Council, with this letter, I'd like to express my opinion about your last decision reguardin mobile phones. I don't think it's up to yout to decide such as those things. You can't - and moreover you shouldn't - stop people from using their mobile phones while they are on public transport or in shops and restaurants. They can use their mobile phones because they don't disturb anyone. Of course, the volume has to be switched off, in order to respect everyone's space. Instead, you should ban the use of mobile phones while people is walking or cycling in the streets. This would be really useful to prevent and avoid accidents: when people is on the street, they have to be focused on what they're doing, otherwise the situation becomes really dangerous. You should ban mobile phones also in those places, such as cinemas and theatres, where it is dark and even the smallest light can disturb those around us. It's no sense banning mobile phones from public transport if people can use them just out their doors, maybe while crossing the street. Mobile phones are not the problem, people is. You should run campaigns that encourage people to use their mobile phones less and live more in real life by teaching them that the real world is outside of their smartphones. People do not learn from prohibitions, but from teachings, explanations and examples. I beg you to retrace your steps to find a better and effective solution. Best Regards, a citizen

Except the affluent countries like US,students in poor countries wish to study abroad. They believe that their education system is much higher than their country. Lagging behind the western countries,most of students in Asian countries are trying to go abroad and study in it. Not only the undergraduates but also the graduates go abroad to get a job with high salary. Because they know that their government is not able to create a special post for them. But some students do not want to go abroad as they are not accustomed to their culture and something like that. From my point of view,I want to study abroad and serve for my country. As you know,studying abroad is not easy,you will experience culture shock certainly. You have to habituate to their food,culture and weather. Worse than that,you might be bullied . To the best of my knowledge,it has been said that some western people discriminate against Asian people because of the race or ethnicity. On the other hand,there are a lot of advantages studying abroad. As you have to learn their language, you will become a bilingual. And you get to know their culture and lifestyle. You begin to know the difference between your country and their country. You will get a ton of knowledge since you can see and learn many different things from them. And with that knowledge, you can serve and strive for your native country's development.

Speaking for myself, it is more effective if the space is more or less open. In the perfect office should not be any walls or things similar to them, which seperates workingspaces . One simple reason is that makes it easier to communicate with other workers in the office, that helps to keep informationflow running smoohtly. In addition, the open space will create a better atomsphere in generell, which can increase moral and productivied. Every walls is an potentional unused space, that could be used for an other coworker to do their work. Some people are afraid of have not enough space, as result of a crowded area those people are more likely to get sick. When workers are sick the enterprise loses a lot of manpower and money. generally speaking, walls are just a waste of room and make people uncomfortable.

The future is unpredictable who know where we can travel to, may be a new solar system, I don't know, the time will answer

Living being completely honest is the hardest thing in my life. Not because I want to lie to people, but because people don't want to hear what they don't expect to. I am one of that person who refuses to lie, but this shape of my personality caused me a lot of problems for all my life. I've never been able to pretend to be a friend of someone, nor to support an idea I didn't share, nor to adapt to something I totally disagreed with. But living in complete honesty, telling always the truth, is very hard and sometimes it becomes impossible, because the consequences of the truth would be true disasters, not only for me, but also for other people. I can't stand the idea of making someone suffer with my truth or honesty, nor creating serious problems. For example, I can't tell my boss that one of my colleagues isn't doing his job properly, because he would be faired, and I don't want this responsibility on me. I can't tell my mother-in-law that her daugher is growing up like a clueless, because she would never let me into her house again. My choice is to avoid situations that don't make me feel comfortable, to preserve civil and pacific relationship with everyone, and to tell a half truth when it is impossible to stay quiet. When it is impossible to say a half truth, I always choose the truth. I don't believe in lies, they are just a way to escape from responsibilities.

There is a conflict between books and technology nowadays. The reasons are many, such as prices and the quality of the products. I personally do not think that computer and tablets should replace books in school because it can be very expensive for a family to buy these technologies. Reading a book is 100 times better than reading a story on a tablet because you can not enjoy them like a real book. Also giving a tablet to students would mean giving the chance to play video games in schools while teachers are talking. This already happens today with smartphones. Books are also useful to take notes, which are important in a student's life or you can underline important paragraphs in order to have a better understanding of the topic which you are going to study. Technologies are not useful for the teacher because a lot of them do not know how to use the modern phone, pc and so on. I personally think that using a book is the best way to teach in these and future days.

Every student should have the possibility to choose where to study. Most part of them can't do it, because going to study abroad is very expensive. Obtain a room in universities' campuses is quite difficutl, because there is a limited number of available rooms. therefore, many families have no alternative but to rent a room. A room can cost around 400,00 euros per month in normal cities, but in the most expensive ones, such as Milan, prices are around 700,00-800,00 euros per month. Moreover, despite being public, university has taxes to be paid, whom amount is based on the annual salary of the family. The problem is that the threshold under which people don't pay is very low and a normal family needs at least 2.000,00 euros per year to pay university taxes. In addition to that, there is material to be bought: a pen is always a pen of course, but a book can even cost 60,00 euros. When I was at university, every exam required at least three books to study. There is also the bus pass to pay. At the end is obvious that studying abroad is an economic choice: those who can do, they do it, those who can't, they don't. I chose to remain because luckily my city offered me the university course I wanted and because I didn't want to leave my family, my boyfriend and my cat, whom I'm very close to. Probably, in other conditions, I would have gone away, in a foreign country, to learn the language, to open my mind, to grow up. Certainly, studying abroad forces to grow up because you're alone, but it is necessary to be a responsible person, a condition too rare nowadays. Living alone doesn't mean living out of rules, but it's a chance to follow our own path.

Office design There is no doubt that one of the important places that people stay at for a long period of their days, is their work place, therefore it should be designed in a way that make you feel comfortable and ready to accomplish your duty. However,in this article I am going to examine various types of office designs. Firstly, one famous design is known as the open desgin, where there are no walls to separate different desks, so all workers work in one huge hall. Also, many employees say that this type of designing has many desadvantges for them, one of which is that sometimes the workplace become so annoying because of the amount of people and the noises would make you work insufficiently. Moreover, those days workplaces in different firms have considered their design to be like this one, which may affect on several workers. Secondly, there is enclosed offices which many workers feel comfortable and happy while working in such design. This employees like this pattern for many reasons. For instance, it provide their own space where they feel free to work without any disturbing noises, therefore, their work would be done efficiently and in a good time. Eventually, we could say that different places and it desgins could massively effect on the workers job. So we need to focus on this fact if we want to succeeded in our business.

Life Choice there is no doubt that we all wish to live a happy and long life. However. the question is; if you can make a choice, would you like to live a long calm life or an intensive short one? In this article I am going to write my own opinion with exampels. Firstly, my Opinion is that I would like to live a short live but that which is filled with excitement and different adevntures. The main reason why I chose this opition is simply because I want to try, I believe it would be wonderful. As my life now is kind of calm, so I think it would be good for me to change it. Besides, it better to live and have great live than to get old and have nothing to do. However, some people may have another opinion. Those people think that living long calm life would be extremely greater than living a short one. Moreover, they argue that living a long life mean to have cheldren of your own and to raise them along side of your husband and to grow old with them. Those people believe that there is no other thing in this life could be compared to this precious moment. Finally, we could say that people have various personalites and whether you disagree with them or not, it dosent matter, because different indiviual has different circumstances then yours.

First of all, I discover this useful tool while I was browsing, and I decided to try and see how it worked. So, the first thing I watched the tutorial video, about the benefits, how the program works, some recommendations and other functions. Since the beginning I like it because when I clicked on the link and in the top of the screen it appeared a small message in which I had to decide my level. After that, I had an activity in which the program gave me a topic and there was a space to write about it. Apart from that, I like there are so many useful tools in the screen for example the timer which helps you to check the time it takes to write an essay or report and the chart where you can see your graph of progress after the revision, I really like this last thing because that helps me get an idea of how I'm improving on the way. Another thing that I like is the fact that there's a space for the feedback in which the program shows up what is wrong in the text, it could be grammar, spelling or about connectors and so on; however, I don´t really like the way the results come into view because it's kind of difficult to understand the symbols so it took me a little bit of time to make my changes. Nevertheless, this program has so many good things and one of them, which I really like is that after you finish your text it tells you in which level you are, so you can practise other activities according your level. Finally, in my opinion I'd recommend "Write and Improve" because it's an amazing tool, it's really useful to improve your writing skill in order to prepare yourself for your next test. On top of that, it has a beauty design and it's easy to understand.

Speaking personally I think that having different teachers each year benefits more to the students because it means an opportunity to learn in many distinct ways. Besides, this brings about a good chance to know a new person who has diverse qualities and thoughts which can be enriching for the students' personal and professional development. On the top of that, if a student has a different teacher every year, he or she likely will develop his or her ability to adapt to the changes; which represents a great chance for the student's development. Furthermore, having a new teacher implies new challenges and a new ways to learn or to explain the subject's topics, as a result that the students will be able to use a set of tools to learn better and they will feel enthsiastic to do new exercises and activities. Apart from this, one of the advantages of having a different professor is the motivation and inspiration that can create in students, one instance could be when the professor does new activities about a topic or when she asks to the students to expose a topic, these activities can make the students feel excited about theme that is discussed. Moreover, every teacher has the chance to promote the creativity in students through different dynamics in the classroom such as collages, games, quizzes about some videos and more. Conversely, when a student has the same teacher for several years, it would be unlikely to discover the way she learns and understand better or develop the skill of adapting to the changes as well as the student can stay in a comfort zone and lose little by little the enthusiasm because the student just gets accustomed to the routine and the way the professor teaches, in other words there are no changes, no new ways and probably no more challenges. Therefore, the best thing for students is to have a different teacher eah year given that there are so many good effects such as motivation's higher levels, useful tools to learn, the skill's development and promote the creativity in students.

English is an international language; it is the third Language more spoken behind only Mandarin and Spanish. In my mind, it is vital to have a command of this Language for communication with other nationalities. International companies use this Language to make trade agreements with other countries. Therefore, when I want to get a job, it is an advantage of the ability to speak different languages. Besides, My main goal in learning, taking an international test, IELTS. International English certificate is essential for entering college or starting studies abroad; it is one of the requirements.

The accidents that kill a lot of people will decrease because all drivers will be controlled by sophisticated computers avoiding in this way, mistakes. Traffic will be much better because people will prefer take public transportation to drive to work. Trains and buses will be comfortable and cheap. On the other hand, some people will spend a lot of money in visiting the moon or even visiting another planet. People who live far away from their family will be able to visit them in their own cars that will spend only a few hours because they will fly.

In my opinion, video games can have a positive impact when sensibly used. Indeed, virtual worlds may have a good impact by enabling young children to escape from a maybe boring or oppressive environnment, or by making them deal with hard situations they might meet later in life . Besides, playing video games requires some skills other activities may not develop as much, as team leading, adaption capacity almost immediat, etc., which can be used afterwards in "real world." Nevertheless, more and more parents complain about their children spending too much time behind the computer, instead of working or playing sport. Others are scared by the lack of attention of their kids while talking or eating, because they had a game just before and are only concerned about whether or not they will win the next one: such behaviour have been frequently reported for young kids. Videos games are therefore so attractive than they can become addictive, in which case the negative impact is huge. . Sadly enough, more and more young people are concerned by this problem. Furthermore, an addiction to video games can drive social and mental problems such as difficulties to communicate, fear of the world and other people, etc. To conclude, I'd say that reasonnably played, video games can have positive effects on children. But as soon as it becomes morelike an addiction than a simple activity, it should be stopped and replaced by something else.

I wish our school also had music and PE class like other countries since I truly enthusiastic about music. Being a poor country,our government is not able to contribute musical appliances to school. As there is a saying " where there is a will,there is a way " ,we can learn about music outside of the school. Sometimes,I thought of myself if I do not have brain to do Math.

The automotive is very lucrative, it is about money and new technologies too in all states around the word so travel by car is one of the future way. The new in the ways of travelling is travel to space. During these days the rockets from Elon Musk and others are tested for safety, comfort and so on.

Advantages and disadvantages of open design are: open design has the best view for employees and employees does not tired because they can easily connection with other employees. The people who work with a computer need to look far to relieve eye fatigue. so close work environment is bad for the eyes. I think open design is better because employees cloud connects each other easily, and employees can move around the office easily. the boss can easily connect with his employees and control them easily.

Well, I think this is an issue debate because there are many elements to take into account in order to express an opinion, as for me I think the video games have a negative impact on children when they are too young and there are reasons for believing this. First of all, speaking personally I feel that nowadays there are so many kinds of video games but the most popular video games are about violence and massacre which increase the probability of aggressive behavior in children, such as bullying or being aggressive with their sinblings. Then, one of the most crucial bad effect on children for play video games is on their health because they spend a lot of time in front of the screen and as a result of this, it can damage their sight. Besides, the lack of physical activity has repercusions in their muscle and bones as well as increases the probabilities to be overweight. Apart from this, other negative consequences on children are the isolation and poor interpersonal skills due to children play video games for long hours in closed spaces, they don't interact with other people so they don't practise communicative ability which would bring out some problems in the near and long term at school, such as difficulties to make friends, challenges in teamwork among others. Adittionally, there are so many cases that have shown how children get obsessed with video games that they try to do less things in their houses and other activities which take their valuable time. One instance could be they just eat junk food and drink some sodas, which are not healthy, so as to save time. Another example is that they don't do their homework or don't study at home so that can invest much more time to play video games; as a result that they do poorly in school. Finally, it seems to me that video games are harmful for the children development, owing to the bad effects, which I've already mentioned, in personal, physical and psychological aspects.

The television is not only for entertainment is also made for education, we can think about all of the tv shows that have been transmitted on television through all of these years, genres like science and history are the most common topics, these tv shows can teach us important things, like the history of humans, the universe, world wars, even television shows that are more dedicated to teaching physics and maths in a more fun way. Television is a massive media, if you want to send a message, for example, to the entire country, the best way to do it will be the television, so all the governments put a lot of attention at what kind of content it's transmitted on television, the most content must be educational, instead of entertainment.

Write and Improve website is an incredible website for practise writing in English for English learners. Since I've started to write on this website, I've found that my English writing has improved tremendously. Whenever I practise to write English often on this website, it brings back forgotten words to my memory. I've started to pay more attention to 'noun', 'adjective', 'adverb' and a structure of every sentence more now. I'm still making mistakes but it's not that bad as before.

Televsion entertains, but it can also educate us in several ways. Television has various programs of learning to offer, which are foucused to all age groups. For instance, adults watch televsion for News, watching broadcast movies as well as series. On the other hand, televsion has wide range of entertainment and education programs to children and young people; such as cartoon movies, wild life shows and science programs; which I think are very mind-blowing for children in their age of intellectual development. Television is one of the major means of media which is used frequently by almost most of the people around the world. However, recently, it has become associated with spreading misleading information and became full of propaganda, i. e the information and stories reported in the media contain some sort of bias, and twisted in the interest of news providers, organisations or foundations. I believe that is what makes televsion isn't always a reliable source for knowledge. Nevertheless, televsion is a major entertainment for children around the world, and it is considered the secondary source of learning after school and books.

Well it is really a great theme to discussion, it is very interesting to think about and of course we have many ways to see that. I know many people that agree with the idea of having the same teacher for years is better for their learning, in the other hand I also know many people who believes that they need to change their teachers each period of time, six months or once a year. I have had many teachers since I started studying English and in this journey I have had good and bad teachers, so for me actually I think it does not matter too much if you change the teacher or not, but like I said before I had good and bad teachers and when you have a good teacher you feel happy and your level improve faster than when you have a bad teacher. The big problem having bad teachers is because they can't help you to improve your English and it causes other problems because you feel exhausted and not interested to do your extras class activities, so it is really bad. In my personal opinion it is better to keep the same teacher if you can, because sometimes when you replace a teacher for another one you can get a worse teacher than the last one and you find a needed to change again and maybe that another one could not be good too and again you desire try another one and it is anyway not good for your learning.

Nowadays people are looking for online English courses. This is a new type of education and has some advantages and disadvantages that have to be had into consideration before applying an online course. One of the main advantages is that online education can reduce costs as courses don't need a classroom and all the facilities as computers and printed materials that usually schools have to provide to their students when they are attending a face-to-face course. For example, Write and Improve is an online platform that help students with writing English activities through interactive exercises, moreover, this online platform has digital resources as writing workbooks for each English level, and also virtual examinations depending on if you want IELTS or general training. Indeed, students can monitor their progress and recognize their strengths and weaknesses in real time in front of their computer wherever and whenever they wish. An additional factor to consider is that this online learning platform has some educational resources such as edition and writing that seek improve our English level. On the other hand, some people could criticize that lack of human physical contact that is inherent in this online platform. Most important, being bilingual or multilingual is a social skill that humans develop in real situations, and only can improve these skills in real life. Write and Improve relies on course online materials but lack human interactions than languages have as corporal language for example. There are some language abilities that can only be acquired on real interactions that obviously a website is unable to replace. For example, pronunciation online programs are unable to teach about all the phonics variety, accents and intonation. Despite these drawbacks, the future is online education, and this is linked with technological advances that obviously are going to tackle these situations, and probably are going to reemplace somehow face-to-face classes.

There is no doubt that volunteer work has a value for our life and that is why I agree with the statament. In my opinion, volunteer work is a valid requirement for students. Volunteer work is a first step to develop empathy and responsibility. In this essay I will explore the reasons. Firstly, volunteer work is a win-win situation. That means is a mutual benefit. For the students which develop soft skills, empathy and responsibility and for those who receive. Secondly, many students who start a volunteer work at high schools brings the experience for the rest of their life. As an example of that, during my high school I did a volunteer work with orphans. This experience changed my life and even after I graduated I continued to visit them. Also, I helped with campaigns for donation which helped to buy food and many other things they need. Thus, volunteer work can be a changing in our life and a mutual benefit.

I prefer having new teachers each year. Having new teachers each year can have many benefits for students. One of the benefits is reducing the likelihood of the teacher having favourite students and make other students feel left out because of this bias. No matter how much ethical a teacher might think he or she has, some of those teachers might fall into this trap without having realized they are having them. Each teacher has a different set of skills she or he uses to teach students. This is mean the students will be able to compare and perhaps learn what skills that enhance their ability to study the most. Adapting to a new teacher every year will give students another proficient skill to adapt to changes outside of school. They can learn to get on with new people and manage to establish the relationship easier when they have some sort of those skills beforehand. Getting to know a new teacher can be an exciting experience. It might sitimulating the learning curve of students to the better. Students are young people, and at their age, they always looking for something new and thrilling. They might want to go to school more because of this reason, thus, will not see school as boring as much as before. Therefore, I encourage all school to have new teachers each year.

Nowedays, most students use a variety of gears to study and it seems that books will be disappeared in the future. In my opinion, while studying with technological equipment is useful, acquiring knowledge is more interesting by using books and paper. The main reason why I quite disagree with replacing technology completely instead of traditional way is that paper could have an amazing impression on us. For example, when I touch or smell books I feel pease and be able to make a good connection with words. Last but not the least, having technological unites is not affordable for most students. In addition, poor people could have access to libraries and study books with lower price. Having said that, it is believed that it is easier to carry a huge ranges of books and articles with tablets to traditional way. Also, if we use tablets to read books, our environment remains safe becuase we do not have to cut enormous trees to produce paper. In conclusion, although studying with computers has some benefits, it is not able to alter books entirely becuase most are not easy with it.

For millenia, parents have told their children to tell the truth, but is this true all the time? Nowadays, there are more and more lies being told every day, some good and some bad. It is up to us to determine whether a lie can or cannot be accepted, but there are still disputes about the boundaries between "right lies" and "wrong lies." Most people believe that all lies belong to one of 3 types. One reason people decieve is to minimize a mistake they have made. While it is true that everybody cannot prevent from making mistakes once in a while, some do not have the courage to admit their errors for fear that they will be blamed or judged. For example, students might lie to their teacher about unfinished homework, they might say that they left the work at home when, in fact they did not do the work at all. The students did this because they wanted to save face. This kind of lie is wrong, you should admit your faults and not make the same mistake again, this is one of the 2 types of "wrong lies." Another reason people tell lies is to get out of situations that they do not want to be in. For instance, if a company decides to have a weekend meeting, one of the managers might not feel like attending. She may call her bass and give this excuse: "I have been fighting off a cold all week, and I cannot risk getting the others sick. I'll be sure to get all of the notes on Monday." When the individual do not want to admit something and face the consequences, they lie to avoid difficulties. This kind of lie is not right, but it is acceptable in some circumstances. It is difficult for people to face difficulties, but they must, so you must avoid this type of lie and face the challenges that lie ahead. Then there are "white lies" that are told when people do not want to hurt other people's feeling. If a good friend, for example, shows up with an unflattening new haircut, one could be truthful and say, "That haircut looks awful, what were you thinking?" A more gentle response would be to say, "It's very original, it suits you." These types of lies are only told when you do not want to hurt someone else's felings, and are generally not considered negative or wrong. To sum up, there are 3 big kinds of lies: lies to minimize a mistake, lies to get out of situations that you do not want to be in, and white lies. while the former two types are considered negative, the latter is acceptable. In the future, I hope no one will tell lies, whether good or bad.

Travelling is one of the most desired leisure activities for people. It is an industry with high impact in the economic development and the planet. So, How is it going to change in future? First at all, I think we will continue to travel as we do today but, maybe we will demand new clean ways to do the transportation. I believe the industry will be the same in the sense of people will want to travel and discovering new places and cultures. The main difference could be the way of do it, focusing in clean mobility.

To be a volunteer is a good thing. However, if the volunteer is "required," it may not be good. The goal of volunteers is "help." Whether help humans, animals or the environment, people do it from the bottom of their hearts makes themselves feel great. Besides, helping others can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. By contrast, someone who is asked to be a volunteer, not aiding others by their own will, may not make all-out effort. These volunteers just want to reach their goals as quickly as possible; therefore, they won't leave no stone unturned. The high schools which demand the voluntary work from their students are well meaning, but that could distort the intent of being a volunteer. The high schools should find some attractive ways, and guide students to the right directions. Only do things from the bottom of one's heart could acqire the treasure of being a volunteer.

I like animals so much. I have a pet, a small and nervous dog. I caught him because it hasn't any person who after him. It has been one of the best moment in my life. Animals must live in freedom. In my opinion wild animals would live better in their own environment. I don't like going to a zoo. I have seen their eyes and I think they aren't happy in this place. People look after them as well as possible and I'm sure that people have tried that animals stay in a zoo as in their own house, but it isn't the same. All animals stay in the earth to do something and this question is impossible if they are as a prison. We are changing our environment cutting trees, making pollution, burning forest, dropping a lot of water, and caughting animals from their places and showing them in a zoo. In conclusion, I would like watching all animals in freedom.

There is no shortage of opinion about whether or not schools should require students to study music and learn to play a muscial instrument. In my opinion, students should not study music if they do not want to. People have different talents and schools should provide a range of options, including music class, yet not that only. In this essay, I will explore the reasons. Firstly, study music and learn to play a musical instrument is good to help to develop skills, such as discipline. However, many students do not have familiarity to play instruments and it should be considered once it can destimulate instead of stimulate their talents. Secondly, I believe some people born with a talent for music. As an example, my brother learned to play guitar by himself. He developed this talent since he was a little boy and nowadays he is a professional guitar player. One day I decided that I wanted to learn to play guitar. I did not have success, I was not able to even hold the guitar the right way. That experienced made me feel sad and I felt I failed to learn. Since then, I decided I would not try to play any instrument. Thirdly, schools can afford with different types of classes, such as music, art or cook in due to stimulated creativity on students. Giving to students many options helps them to choose which one they prefer and which one will be helpful for their career. In conclusion, although music classes develops discipline, I support the opinion that music classes should not be a requirement. As I noted above, schools should provide a range of options.

First of all, I think it is a fantastic experience with so many advantages and some "disadvantages" which I prefer to name them as learning. By way of introduction, studying abroad it is highly recommended in the majority of schools and universities because of the opportunity that a student can have in order to improve another language. Apart from that, there are so many skills that one student can develop or improve during an exchange, such as communicative and social skills, due to the student meet new people from a different country and from a different culture, he has to find ways to interact and make friends. In addition, other advantage is that the student would learn to work with multidisciplinary teams, a great skill which it'd be really significant for his or her resume in the long term for internships or work. Moreover, an incredible advantage from having an exchange is to visit different touristic places, such as beaches, desserts, mountains, museums, lakes and archeologycal places. Besides, the student can try new and diverse dishes which are traditional or very popular in the residence's country. On the other hand, the student will have the challenge to develop the ability to adapt to change, owing to the student is going to live far from home in a new city, as well as far from friends and family. She has to face the changes in her routines and start to visualize and plan the new activities according to her circumstances. In spite of, all the opportunities and advantages there are also some disadvantages from having an exchange, one instance could be that it can take much more time to finish a degree, due to the university just allow the students certain number of subjects which is no bad at all because the universities do this in order to make your exchange more enjoyable and with a little bit of less stress. However, I think that one disadvantage when a student starts studying abroad is the fact that the new university has different rules and processes to assess the students, which at the same time represents a challenge to develop strategies in order to get the most favorable results. Nevertheless, another disadvantage of studying abroad is it is an expensive experience that requires too much money and unless that a student wins a scholarship to make the exchange, which it just cover part of the expenses, she will have to pay the flight tickets, the housing, the food and costs of travelling and the payments to the university. Finally, speaking personally I would strongly recommend all the students to make an exchange in wherever they want and not only learn and enjoy but also lose and find new wonderful places, change yourself, make new friends and appreciate that unique experience of studying abroad.

In my opinion, Health is of way more priority rather than wealth. There are absolutely no disadvantages of having excellent health. For example, if we are very rich but our health is not impressive then we will probably die soon and our wealth will be of no use. Could it save our health? It could not! On the other hand, if we have marvelous health but don't have that much money, we can still live a long life. If we are not healthy, we cannot even enjoy our life properly, because it will be so small that we won't be able to store precious moments of our family and friends. We will then realise the real meaning of 'Health is wealth'. It will come to our mind that our wealth was of no use and couldn't even save us from death. Thus, it is proved that health should be on a higher pedestal than our wealth because wealth is of little use but health is very precious.

Video games are very popular nowadays, not just with children, but many adults also enjoy playing games in their video games console or on their computer. With the evolution of the technology, the games are become more realistic and it makes this kind of distraction very interesting to do for people that like it. You will find some especialist saying that the video games are very bad for children, because it can cause some damage in their brain and besides that it could cause social problems too. For they if the children starts playing games in a younger age it can cause an addction to playing game all the time and the children lose the interest of to do other tasks, like study or do some physical sports. However, many other specialists and parents agree that the playing game can improve some abilities in a children's lives. Some especialists says that the games can help children to be more concentrate, more calm, and playing games can improve their ability to think faster and it could help they to solve complex problems. Of course, it is a complex subject to discuss, I think is necessary to do many studies to know if playing games is good or bad for children. For while, I guess the best thing to do is to be careful with the time your kids is spending playing games and bisedes that we need to be very carefully in what kind of the games we are leaving our children to play. Because some games are so violent and some times it contain sexual scenes or inapropriate language for kids.

Speaking personally, I think zoos are good places to learn about animals and there are other reasons which bring about so many benefits. First of all, in my opinion zoos allows us to learn about the characteristics of animals, such diet, endangered species, the places where they from, behaviors and so on. Moreover, zoos make us feel conscious about how some of our actions have side effects on animals and in their habitats, one instance could be the industrial growth, which is generating pollution in rivers and oceans, in the air and if that was enough this also provokes soil erosion and acid rain affecting the animals' habitats. Furthermore, another action which doesn't have good effects on the animals, is the creation of large amounts of trash, which reaches seas and oceans, and can kill marine species as tortlues, sharks, penguins whales among others, when they eat the plastic. On the top of that, in the face of many cases in Africa and Asia of clandestine hunting, which consists of hunters just chasing and killing animals, in order to obtain their tusks in the case of elephants or their fur in case of bears, seals and sea lions. So, zoos not only represent a house for many of these animals but also zoos save them from clandestine hunting. Apart from that, zoos can offer security to the animals and prevent animals from extinction. Additionally, zoos are those places where some animals can receive care and food when they are in risk or their habitats are no in great conditions, which has saved the lives of several animals; as well as zoos try to provide similar habitats to the animals in order to make them feel at home and they don't lose some instincts, which they need once they can go to a poaching-free habitat. Nonetheless, it is just necessary to take into account the treat and care that animals have to receive from zoos, such as food in good conditions, veterinary care, spaces with the necessary conditions and so on. As a conclusion, I think zoos are good places they can provide so many benefits to the animals and teach us so many valuable things about them.

It is really wonderful to see animals in the forest living their lives free, but it is not so commom anymore. The natural enviromment has become smaller, and the natural habitat for wild animals almost dosen't exist anymore. An alternative that human had found to make people keeping some contact with wild animals was to create a fake enviromment and put some species of animals there. It is not a perfect place for the animals, but is a place where they can have food and medical care. To keep these places working normally visitors have to pay for visitation and this money is used to manage the zoo. Is it the best way to keep animals? Of course not, and I think everyone agree with it, but in other hand, sometimes it is the only way to keep some species alive because their enviromment no longer exist. It is so sad to see animals in a joule, how if they are guilt for something, but they're not! They just don't have more space to live. I know many people like going to zoos, take pictures and have fun with different species of animals. For me it is not fun, I would see they in a natural enviromment if I could. To bee honest I think is too wrong to keep wild animals in a zoo, but I know that have many zoos that keeps ill animals that they won't live alone, in this case I think is great because that animals would die and have a chance to live, although it isn't a perfect life. I know that the us humans need to think how could we do to bring some better condition of life for the animals.

The new school year has just begun. I have a lot of works to do such as improving my English writing skill, learning about financial management, and how to work with people.

First of all, lies are in generell not a bad thing, it is how most of all people use them these days. They lie to avoid uncomfortable situations and make things even worse with that. Lying is never the solution to a serious problem, it might delays the conseques, but in exchange the are most of the time a lot more sevre. If all Human-beings would communicate honest and try their best to avoid lies or misunderstandings, it would be so much easier for everybody. You could tell exactly know, what the counterpart wants from you. I mean in some moments it easier to lie than tell the truth, just because you do not want hurt someone else's feelings, but in the end the will know want the truth is and then it will hurt even more. There are some exception for example when your children ask you something you cannot answer properly so they would understand so you better come up with a good lie. Prime example is Santa Claus or everything similar to that, you do not want to ruin your child's dreams or their childhood by telling them all those fairytales are not real, it would crush them. So in conclusion lying is most of the time just postpone the drama, so only lie to your children or grandchildren and only if necessary.

Many countries sponser their students to go abroad during high school or university and other countries has programmes for professionals to do their Postdegree or MasterDegree obroad as well. It is so interesting because these people can learn not only new subjects but they can learn about new culture and can expand their horizons. Some people disagree that the countries sponser students to go abroad to study, because they believe that the money that the government spend with these students could be used in coletive actions to help more people, because for they all citizens pay taxes and this money of taxes could not be used for individuals interest, that money need be used for coletive interest only. However, there are many people that agree that the government can sponser students to study abroad, for they it is interesting because these students will achieve a good qualification and they can contribuite for the development of their native countries when they finish their studies and came back for their native countries. I think it is really interesting and import for the students, because they will achieve more than just formal qualification, they will learn different ways to do things, different ways to think about the same problems and a possibility to interact with another culture is really great for all people. I know that many countries sponser their students to do it, but if the government does not provide it and you have the chance to go abroad by yourself to study is perfect you do it, so your horizons will be open more than you can imagine after finishing your studies.

About office design, I believe an open space is more efficient than an enclosed workstation. To those who believe an enclosed workstation is the one who like to work in a prison type space. To me, it feels like no freedom and limited your working area in a confined space. However, if working in an open area, it enables people to talk freely, work freely. Such condition enables people to come closer and work together instead of distancing themselves in a cubicles space which limits the corperation with each other. One good example is Google. Google has a free open environment for people to work anywhere they want. Today they may choose to work near a park. Then, the next day, they may choose to work near a playground. Such freedom enables workers to have a choice. By having a choice, there is where the imagination comes from and gives value to the company. This is a valuable asset and could not be present in an enclosed workstations.

In a world that promotes mainly comfort and sedentary life, sport can be considered a loophole. Introducing more sports classes can be regarded as a solution for this problem but I do not consider that forcing students into taking them is a wise decision. First of all, the most beneficial part of doing sport is improving health quality. In most cases children tend to spend time only on computers and this can lead to scoliosis, obesity and other health issues. Secondly, playing sports can have other benefits, like learning to be part of a team. It is generally thought that being a team player is an advantage for job applications. A good illustration of this is the structure of an interview when almost always, the employer asks you how well can you collaborate with other colleagues. Furthermore, the current generation known as ”Y” generation or ”snowflakes” is at great susceptibility for mental health diseases. That being said, playing sports can help children be happier. Evidence for this is provided by the secretion during physical activities of substances that makes you feel relaxed and peaceful, such as serotonin and dopamine. In addition, sport can take the form of a hobby, hence giving students the opportunity to have a leisure activity and take a break from all the studying. In spite of all the advantages that come from sport, I think that forcing children into doing it is wrong. There is a reason to believe that coercing a child into doing something can be regarded as a bad technique. Thus, obliging students in taking more sport classes can have a negative outcome, for instance they will drop sports for good. Taking everything into consideration, even though physical activity has many pros, forcing that to students can result in the exact opposite.

Given to the fact that most medical doctors prefer to work in cities where they will make a lot of money instead of working in rural areas, an unbalanced situation is raised where people in rural area receive poor medical care and people in urban area receive good medical care. This unbalanced situation caused people to move towards cities and leave away rural areas. One of the reasone behind this is there is not enough financial support from the Government and poor administration to rural area. It causes doctors to lose their motivation to work in rural area , if they can receive more incentive in cities. To solve this situation, the Government plays a important role in mininizing the gap between cities and rural areas by trying to provide more incentives and giving support for doctors who work in rural area. Such incentives could be present in a form of financial support.

For me learning English is very important due to knowing another language gives you opportunities like to get a better job, meeting people, visiting other countries, and particularly allows you to get relevant information about important topics. However, speaking in a professional context, knowing another language is very important for better development of a professional, I'd like to be an engineer and if I want to work for an international company, I have to know another language because I'm going to be in contact with people of different countries, all of the information that I'm going to work is going to be in English due to this language is very common around the world.

Dear Betty, I am writing to tell you about the concert I have been to last week. Firstly, when I heard that Green Day were going to have a concert in my city, I knew I must go to it, because if has been my favourite band for many years. The concert was absolutely wonderful. I had the opportunify to see my idol, Billie Joe Armstrong, in flash and bones. Plus, I had a seat in the first line. Can you believe it? He looked directly into my eyes. For me it was more than a concert, it was a real experience. It was amazing to turn up the phone lights and to sing along with the crowd their most underrated songs, such as "21 guns" or "Holiday." I had so much fun and I hope that one day we will go together to one of their concerts. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Love, Bianca.

In every country, there are many problems that have not been able to be solved. Not being enough doctors in rural areas is a common problem today. Most medical doctors want to work in cities where they can make a lot of money. Yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I think it is not only because of money but because of accommodation and food. And they probably don't like the environment. In cities, everything is great like the internet connection, food and so on. The rural areas are very poor in everything in comparison to cities. So, most of the doctors don't want to spend time in rural areas. Moreover, as I mentioned above,they can't make a great deal of money when they are in rural areas. For example, in developing countries, doctors tend to open clinic on the basis of their respective field. They make extra money from doing so. To solve this problem, the government should give the doctors an incentive to work in rural areas. For instance, giving pay rise or giving elite privileges to the doctors who work in rural areas might help solve this problem, I think.

human history shows music has been integral part of her or his life. You see these things in ancient discoveries. Archaeologist have unearthed many musical instruments. This shows that music has always existed in human life. You never see music is not part of human life. Of course some children were taught music by their parents or other people. Although this method was not systematic, in any case, it has helped the continuation of music in the history of human life. Student in school study many subjects, for example math, physics history etc. So students in school need subject be relaxed, studying could help to them, and other important reason is it is necessary to learn music from childhood/ Thus, compulsory music education at school helps students, teachers and parents to realize the talent of students in the field of music. So I think all students should have to study music in school.

At the present we know that the studies have shown the great benefits of a healthy lifestlyle. Thus, exercise along with a few others healthy habits can reduce the risk of premature death. I completely agree that exercise is important for our health, but our diet, the quality of our sleep, no smoking are important as well. Firstly, study investigators calculated life expectancy by how many of these healthy habits people had. As a result, according to this analysis, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. Secondly, we can take better care of our health as long as we don't ignore the aspects that are in our control, such as making exercise a regular habit, getting enough sleep, eating a well- balanced diet or quitting smoking. In addition, looking after our emotional well-being is just as important as caring for physical health. By nurturing wellness, we are better able to handle life's challenges. Moreover, switching to a healthy lifestyle doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. In conclusion, my opinion is that it is not very hard, but it is absolutely important to have as many healthy habits as possible.

First of all, I think that exercise is not only important for our physical health but also contributes to have a better quality of life, due to when we work out we have more energy for our daily activities, we feel more relaxed and we can reduce our stress levels. However there are other things that we can considered as important as exercise even there are others that we considered more important. One instance of this could be, learning a new language, which could represent an opportunity to develop a new skills, have more knowledge and be able to communicate with other people in our work and personal life; on the top of that we often considered imprescindible to learn a new language in order to visit other countries, meet new people, know other cultures and traditions, besides it means an opportunity to enjoy a wonderful trip, which is one of my personal goals. Apart from that, I think my studies are really important for us as students and sometimes we dedicate more time to study for tests than the exercise; owing to, what we learned during our years in university would be essential so as to have a successful future career. In addition, I would say that dedicate time to our family is also more important than exercise, so in order to drive this home, I think not only our families are our foundation and our support when we are feeling down, but also they are who can we share our achievements and hapinnes with. Finally, I would say that, indeed there are other things that have more priority over exercise but that doesn't mean that we are carelessly in working out, it just mean that we would often make decisions about what to do with our time and our lives according to our priorities and what we want to achieve in the long term.

It is a tricky question, because I think it can be done both. If I had to choose, I would go for a short intense life. I can't see myself doing nothing during my life. What is the meaning of life when the only thing you do is to live, and do nothing that you enjoy. I am a bold person, I am a daredevil, as a result I like taking risk, it is in my genes. I like rock climbing, running, I intend to do skydiving in the near future. Even I am mindful that these activities are risky, I am nothing but a coward who run away when he encounters risk. Admittedly, I am more likely to die, but it is when I am close to death that I am overwhelm with my emotions that I feel the most alive. People who are not risktaker will never undertake projects or activities that would result in failure. These people need to get over it and to push themselves beyond the line. I am not of this kind, I perceived my dreams and projects whether it is risky, bold, mindless or not as long as I will relish the process to get it. I think a shorter life is more meaningful than a long and dull life. I do not want to keep slumping on my sofa while looking at the world going forward through my window.

Today I choose the topic an opinion essay Health or wealth. In my opinion everybody says that the health is more important than wealth, of course. But the reality is different. There is the compulsory health insurance in Europe. When we are children the compulsory health insurance is paid by the Czech republic, when we are 18 years old we have to pay ourselves. We have the health care in each moment in the system of the insurance. If anyone has no job he has to be in the evidence of unemployed. He gets a dose each month and the compulsory payments are paid by the Czech Republic. The second situation is in the USA. It is an opposite side. The health care is not for everybody. I can pay for the health insurace but I do not have to pay it. If I am ill and I have to go to the doctor I have to pay for all injections and pills.

The future of Travel Nowadays we are facing a new era in which the coronavirus has brought up changes in our ways to do the things and one of them is the way we travel. As a result I think travel will be different in the future, starting with the reduction of the number of people that are going to be allowed to go to some places such as museums, stadiums and parks. Besides, it will likely that people prefer to go to near places rather than further countries in the short term so as to protect themselves from the virus. Moreover, the way hotels and hostel clean their dorms is going to be different in the future, because they will have to make a perfect cleaning with special equipment so as to disinfect every room, every time a visitor checks out and other checks in, in order to ensure the travellers the best possible residence. On the top of that I believe that the technology and the artificial intelligence are going to play an important role in the way we travel one instance of this could be that now thanks to them there are going to be offered simulations of different travels to different countries in which people will be able to experiment a trip hence they will have the opportunity to take a better decision of where places to visit. Apart from that, I think the way we transport and travel is going to change in the future, in view of technology has advanced too much I think there will be other kinds of airplanes and cars, which also are going to be cheaper and more accessible. On the other hand, I think there are many ways of travelling which still be the same in the future, such as the routes of travel, these routes wouldn't change because they have been determined taking into account the preservation of the touristic places. In addition, I think travelers will continue to make reservations in hotels and hostel the way they have made it so as to save money and time once they arrive at another country. Also, restaurants and cafes will still attending the travellers in the same way in every tourist point owing to people still would prefer to eat out rather than stay at home and cook hence . Finally, travel is going to be the same in the aspect of formalities, that is to say the countries' boarders are going to still ask for passports and valid visas with the purpose of have a control over the number of people who enters and who leaves the country.

There are those who prefer to live their own while they are attending school, and there are those who choose to live with their parents while they are students. The difference depends on the choice of personal decision. It is up to their consideration ranging from financial situation to personal matter. To me , I think moving away and living on their own is better choice, if students are able to choose whether to stay with family or living on their own. The reason is simple. It is time for them to take care themselves. As a student, besides pursing academic road, learning and adapting a new environment is another aspect that students have to learn themselves. It is a place where students acquire social and living skill in a school environment. It is better to acquire it at an early stage instead of at adult stage where they face an even harsh challenges.

Nowadays most of the medical doctors want to work in cities to make a lot of money and find all that they need like shops and markets or even governmental interests. This problem isn't easy to be solved but the government shloud solve it quickly because of adults and children who are sick and can't work as a reason for illness. This problem need many changes to be solved, it's' easy to find the solution but its difficult to make it. One of them is building good hospitals for doctors to work in. That is very important because it makes the doctor feel like if he is working in the city. It also will be more accurate and easy in treating patients. Second, we should build compounds where doctors live. The most important thing in the compound or the place where the doctors live should contain the main services like water, light, internet or even stores of food. The last but not least is the goerrnmental interests and the police, they are very important because no one will leave a safe city and go to an unsafe place. We should build offices for police and the governmental interests. All in all there should be doctors in rural areas and they need to find all that they need.

In history of human life, we saw in rich class parents, sent children to boarding school, but most of them stayed at home, because they have not enough money to send children to boarding school. But why parents send children to boarding, because they want their children learn how to live independently. Students who go to university to continue their education, move away from their families, and live in independently, have advantages and disadvantages. Most important results are: they learn how to deal with problems and solve them alone, they face problems that have not encountered before and are forced to a find a solution to them, and this is very useful for their future. of course, every student could not live on their own. Another important case is they learn how to deal with other people. Conclusion: life students on their own is important for future life, they learn how to deal problems and deal with other people. Therefore I suggest every student if they could live on their own.

What is the best office to work in? From parents, friends, films, books or other sources I know two general types of offices. The first one is when everyone is sitting in the same room and can communicate without e-mails or phones, but just by shouting or going to the neighbour. Such offices are useful for worker who have a group-project because they can exchange permanetly about the level of project. But in my opinion the socond design for offices is better. Here only one or two workers are sitting in the same room. In this case they can create their rooms like they want in order to have a suitable atmosphere. Another positive point about wirking alone is that you are not distracted by other people. I knew from school that working with a lot of people simultaneously is very difficult, because people speak about every topic except the task to be done. In summary I think that working in the same building, so you can spend your lunchenon with colegue, is good, but sharing a big office with 10 people is not efficient for your work.

Nowadays a lot of young adults, teenagers and school children are struggling with obesitas symptoms. This is because most of them are sitting inside for the whole day and do not enough sports. Because of this, it can be questioned if it is appropriate to force all mentioned young people to do exercise activities at least three times a week. The first advantage by forcing students to do sports three times a week, is to make sure that they are not behind their laptops or tablets. Teenagers do not move enough when they are behind their screens for the whole day. Furthermore, students will get concentration problems when they are not taking enough time to relax. Besides this, the motorical development of those children will not be as good as when they do sports a few times a week. The second advantage is, that children will improve their unhealthy lifestyle. A common fact is that teenagers eat too much fastfood. A consequence for this situation is that a lot of young people have been diagnosed with obesity or diabetes. Doing more sports could be a solution to improve their lifestyles. A disadvantage for forcing students is that not all people have the ability to pay contribution, because they do not earn enough money or to go for sports that is further away because their parents do not have a car. For those poor families, the government has to pay for the sport lessons of these student if the state wants to force them to go. In summary, it is a good idea to force students to exercise more often so that young people can improve their lifestyles and can relax in the fresh air. A solution for poor families is a gift from the government so that their children are also able to improve their physical and mental wellbeing.

We,humans have to work for a living. We need food to be alive and we need shelter to live comfortably. Consequently, we need money to some extent. However, money can't solve any problem; it can't buy us happiness. In order to live peacefully,health plays a vital role in our daily life. It seems to me that health is more important than wealth. Do you ever ask yourself if you live to work or work to live? For me,I work to live. Being healthy is a blessing:you can do anything you want and go anywhere you want. In other words, you can't do whatever you would like to if you are not in good health. For example,supposing you are ill,you will not be able to go to school or work. You would have to stay at home until you are well. Besides, your mother would go out of her way and make time to take care of you. There would be nothing good for you. That's why you have to stay healthy physically and mentally. It is essential to not forget that you are enough. We don't need to try to be wealthy like others. I am not saying that being wealthy is not good at all. As I mentioned above, we need money to live properly. I mean that we should not work desperately without taking good care of health,which lead to disorder. In fact,we will not be able to make money if we are unhealthy. To sum up,I strongly believe the idea that " healthy is a wealthy " . For the reasons I mentioned above, I personally believe that health is definitely important than wealth.

In my opinion , it is better that we have new teachers each year. With new teachers we can have new experiences. Of course it depends on the beheavor of each teacher. Each student is different of other students. A good teacher is who can understand her / his students and have a good relationship with them . For each edge we need special teacher . All of the teachers must learn about the beheavour and skills of students. As an example , imagine a child student and a poor student. There are a lot of difference between them . Another reason that I do not agree with have the same teacher is I think if we change our teacher we will have good resualts. If a teacher had some problems with her /his students and we do not change her /his students in the next year . I think we will transfer the problems . We will not be able to change them.

There are a variety of activities which required high school students to complete before entering either a university or working live. One of them is voluteer work, in my opinion this type of work is genuinely suitable for high school students. There are a lot of reasons for joining volunteer work. For instance, they can learn how to deal with difficult situation once they enter the real working world and they can find their own passion throughout their volunteer work. Volunteer work is the right way for high school students to practise their skills outside the classroom. They are able to witness the work system in each job ,moreover they can learn how to handle and be prepared for a difficulty which they will encounter later once they have a full-time job. Another good reason for being a part of volunteer work is students are able to search for a job that suits their abilities and personalities. They will try out from volunteer work whether they like to pursue that career or completely change to different career paths. In conclusion, high school students should be introduced to volunteer work, so they will be able to cope with any obstables that will be thrown to them. And also they will be able to search and select the right job for their future.

For three weeks, I use the Write and Improve program for my English Writing. And I can see my progress very clearly. Before I found this free program for English Writing, I was concerned that even if I try to write an English article, nobody will correct it and give me feedback. Furthermore, it is also very tedious to find exciting topics every day for writing. The Write and Improve program has solved all these problems. Since then, I am very motivated to practise my English. Of course, this program is also not perfect. E. g., The main drawback in my viewpoint is that the program cannot find all errors, and you still need to do the additional grammar check with other programs. But since it is for free and has much more useful functions, I will give it excellent feedback and recommend it to the other.

Everyone has his own opinion. we also put in our thoughts that it's back to the teacher if he is good or bad. But I think it is better to have the same teacher because,you take a lot of time to feel comfortable with your teacher and that's back to you in communciate. You will have a chemistry with your old teacher and this will be good and will not makes you shy to ask him for something. And he will be helpful with you because you are already his friend and you spend a lot of time together. So that's what I mean a good and respect relationship with him. In other case if you had a bad teacher it will be suck for you to do anything with him even just talking,it will be the black year or more for you because you had a bad memory with him,however you have to respect you teacher even he's bad.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to keep any animals in zoos because zoos can save many animals for many reasons. The first reason, many zoos are places for endangered animals which can live without hunting by huntmans in their natural habitats. The second reason is to breed some animals that are almost extinction and reintroduce them to thair habitats again. This program can improve animal genetic in the nature and reduce cross breeding in animal herds. Moreover, some animals have a problem of mating , for example, clouded leopard males are very aggressive when they are in estrous period and they can kill their mates while they are mating. That is no use if clouded leopard females die from mating. Sciencetists and veterinarians find the way to increase the animal population by using artificial insemination technique. For the last reason, zoos are shelters for the amimals which came from wildlife trafficking. We can't let them free because they have been brought from the forest when they were young and their instinct behaviors have changed. In the other hand, zoos should provide the environment in animals cages like their natural habitats and strengthen their behavior by supporting enrichment in the cages in order to avoid steriotypic behavior.

Do you like travelling? Have you ever wondered how the travel will be in the future? Or maybe you even enjoy dreaming about a unique spaceflight? Follow me: I'm going to explore these ideas more fully! On the one hand, a journey of discovery brings a lot of joy and maybe for this reason we are powerful explorers. As a result, the tourism revolution seems to be closer than ever and the space tourism could very soon become our reality. The passengers will board on astonishing vehicles which will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown. On the other hand, unless you aren't interested in spacecraft and travel beyond Earth, you might enjoy the classical holidays. In my opinion, the well- known means of transport will be used as usual and the tourists will travel all around the world for sightseeing and discover the wonders of our amazing planet. Trains, plains or boats will be utilised by many people in order to reach their travel destinations. Each year the world sees different travel trends that come and go as technology and other factors vary. Clearly, new ways of travel will need to be both safe and sustainable at the same time.

Adults have a different way of learning. Studying through a computer is an easier way to learn without going out and facing traffic and even having to go to another city. On the other hand, computers are going to play an important role in education for children. For example, in case of a disease or a cirurgy that a child has to be at home, a teacher can explain all the subject through the computer and perhaps the student can participate during the class in a virtual way. To sum up, computers will change all the way that we know about schools. A large number of people will be able to study any course at home. Although it is revolutionary, schools will be the same because social interaction is very important for a child.

Freedom is is a fundamental part of society. Most people believe that they can do anything they want unless it is wrong. This value, however, is at odds with recent trends. Nowadays, more and more schools are forcing students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week, regardless of the student's opinions. Should we honor freedom above all else and allow students to choose whether to do sports activities, or force them to do at least 3 sports activities per week? Forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week is better for three reasons. Participating in sports activities have been shown to enhance a student's academic preformance. The University of Kansas saw that students-athletes had higher GPAs (Grade-Point Averages) and a 10% higher rate for graduating from high school than students who do not participate in sports activities. This is because doing sports have been shown to increase grey matter in your bain, so enhancing students' academic preformance. This is one major reason why students should be forced to do at least 3 sports activities per week. Forcing students to do at least 3 sports activities per week would also teach the student more about time management. The student will need to learn how to manage his time to ensure that he makes it to practise and games while also completing his school work and studies. This shows that forcing students to do sports activities can help them be better at managing their time. This is another reason why schools should force students to participate in sports activities at least 3 time per week. Last but not least, compelling students to do sports activities at least three times a week improves students' ability to make decisions. In sports, things happen quickly and an athlete needs to react fast to be effective. This is an ability the student will build upon as he obtains more experience. This is the third reason why schools should force students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Opponents of schools forcing students to do sports activities saw that freedom is key. So, students should have the freedom to choose whether to do sports. This point has some merit on the surface, but, enforcing this rule is for the student's own benefit. This rule helps students to improve themselves. In summary, schools should compel students to do at least 3 sports activities per week because participating in sports and enhance students' academic preformance, teach students about time management, and improves students' ability to make decisions. I envision a future in which all schools requires students to do at least 3 sports activities per week, and the students eagerly cooperate.

With the development of globalization, the number of students studying abroad is increasing dramatically. Twenty years ago, there were only three main destination countries for most Chinese students to learn aboard: Japan, the UK, and the USA. Now Chinese students are everywhere. Besides the previous popular countries like Japan, the UK, and the USA, other European countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are also becoming popular. There are advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad. Firstly, The students who study abroad can experience a different culture and life and broaden their knowledge. Secondly, most students also want to improve their foreign language. For instance, most Chinese students don't speak English in their daily life. However, excellent English is a must in almost all work fields. Therefore, many students choose to study in the USA to improve their spoken English and better understand western culture. Besides advantages, there are still some drawbacks that one cannot ignore. Firstly, the cost of aboard study is relatively high. For example, especially in the USA, the students pay around 50.000 dollars per year. It is quite expensive for most of them. Secondly, many students who study abroad cannot adapt to the new environment; they don't have many friends there and always feel lonely. Thirdly, as far as I know, many Chinese students are much too shy and are not good at accomodating themselves to the new culture and environment. Therefore, they only try to get in touch with other Chinese students and have very little chance to speak English or other foreign languages. As a result, many of them still cannot speak English fluently even after the aboard study. Studying abroad is an excellent chance to boost foreign language skills and experience a different lifestyle and culture. However, how much one will benefit from it varies from person to person.

Nowadays, I just try to enjoy my family in my free time, such as, going to the beach or golf course. I often go every Friday and Saturday. The main reason, I like to go to the beach with my family, that's why we can do something different than our work week and we could speak, play and tell some jokes outside. Furthermore, we swim and sunbathe at the beach. Due to the lockdown and government restrictions, we couldn't go to the beach since last summer. Finally, I sometimes like being alone without my family, and I read some books and watch some movies or series from Netflix or HBO in English, because one of my activities is to study English to understand my colleagues and speak better.

It is argued that telling the truth is vital for every moment of life. While lying has some drawbacks, I quite agree that we need to use lie in some fundamental occasions. There are some benefits to hide the truth in some ways. On the one hand, if people face a situation which is a matter of death and life for them, they must tell lies. Sometimes you must not reveal the truth if you think it could put you and people who you love at risk. For example, when somebody is threatened by a thief who wants to give important information, they have to ignore telling truth to save their life. In addition, in any national circumstances, decision-makers have to give wrong data or lie to the public. It means when a country faceing a foreign interference like the war, politicians must prevent to tell the truth about their strategies and missions. For instance, in the war between Iran and Iraq in 1980, the Iranian commanders did not reveal any data about the weapons and their plans to the public or media to avoid any dangerous situation for soldiers. If any vital information have been disclosed to people showing the honesty, country would fail in the attack. In conclusion, although telling a lie is unacceptable between some individuals, in my view, in any specific situation we must neglect the truth to save our life or national benefits.

Hello Tresa, What have you been doing lately? I miss you. We haven't seen each other for a month. I want to tell you about the concert I went to last week. As you know,I am the biggest fan of BTS. I've always wanted to attend their concert. But I never had a chance to go. Because their concert tickets are too expensive for a student like me to buy. As luck would have it,my grandfather gave me pocket money before they announced the concert date. With that pocket money, I bought the ticket. Some might think that it is unreasonable spending such an amount of money on a concert ticket. But I've waited for so long to see them in reality. That is once in a lifetime opportunity. So, I decided to take it at all costs. I still can't believe that I saw them performing on the stage in reality. I have just always watched their performance on my phone screen. The real voice of them are really amazing. But the trouble was that I couldn't watched the performance till the end. Because I fainted during their performance since it was the very first time that I'd stood up for so so long. I was very sorry about it. Next time,I will watch the performance till the very end. I think my letter is too long. So,let me stop my letter here. I hope to see you soon.

In my opinion an open office design is an advantage for both workers and employers according to the following reasons. First of all, because of the spacious design, workers are able to communicate freely with one another. The missing physical border might also reduce the mental border, preventing some employees from asking a superior for support or assistance. In my view these interactions add real value to the company and the product or service which is developed. So not only the workers themselves but also the firm might gain an advantage from this kind of office design. Moreover the office has always been a social place. This is again stressed by the outbreak of the corona virus right now. Which shows that the social culture is a crucial part of a company's identity. This culture must be lived in everyday conversations and everyday acting which is difficult in environments where everyone is working in his own limited space.

Well, as a little girl, my family loved to travel, especially countries with mild or hot weather as well as beautiful nature. As for me, I like transportation more, as I love all cities and the way they are transported. For example, Egypt uses taxis more. People in Saudi Arabia use private cars, in addition to China they use all means of transportation such as trains, cars and airplanes. In most of the years there has been a development in the automotive industry. People of the future prefer fast travel. And due to climate change in the universe, more and more heat in the world is increasing. So this is a big problem that we have to deal with as it becomes more complicated, However, we cannot travel.

My personal experience, last year I liked doing physical activities. I believe that this paragraph is important for students because the paragraph depends on activities such as stimulating the brain, maintaining a healthy body, and it helps the student focus on learning all the time .. My fields of learning make me happy, chemical reactions I don't talk about because my major is chemistry. No, I really like these interactions things when I was in high school. My opinion is that there are some things in the school that must be changed, for example, to provide requirements for certain chemicals for safe reactions. I am not in a hurry as far as achieving my goals, I think there should be walking step by step as I slowly learn, this is what I learned from scientists. Finally, I suggest the school principal let me if I can make a presentation of how students use chemistry tools, as well as how they can deal with hazardous situations. Because I became a chemist and I want people to benefit from the things around them.

Zoological gardens are a controversial component of human society. They provide a safe refuge for endangered or injured animals, but these parks can be abusive in their treatment of creaturs as well. There are not only plenty of advantages but also lots of disadvantages of zoos. Firstly, the proponents state that these facilities help us to conserve endangered species. Zoos have brought several animal species back from the brink of extinction. For instance, California condors were down to 27 before facilities in Los Angeles and San Diego started breeding programs to protect them. Several other animals, such as bongos, Regent Honeyeaters, can also take credit for their survival thanks to zoos. Secondly, zoos provide an economic boost to their community. Zoos can be local, national, or international attractions that people want to see. These attractions are often safe spaces for young families to come out and enjoy a day together. Apart from this, these facilities can create good-paying jobs, encourage entrepreneurs to be active in their community, and provide indirect profits to local businesses as well. However, the opponents state when animals are born in captivity, they become dependent on humans. The reason why most of the animals that are in zoos today are the offspring of captures animals from the generation before is the fact that the descendants are unable to cope in the wild by themselves. Furthermore, there is an ethical question that we must answer. Most wild animals thrive when they can live in their natural habitat. When we bring them into an enclosure of any type, then it can have a direct and adverse impact on their health. Orcas are an excellent example of this issue. Their lifespan sees s reduction of 70% when they live in captivity. In general, the discussions about zoos are very controversial nowadays.

In Thailand, many parents support their children to study abroad in order to get new experiences and improve the languages. There are many advantages of studying abroad for example students can learn new curriculums or techniques that are not taught in Thai education. Students can improve their language with native speaker of each country that they have gone to. To learn the traditional culture is a very good experiences in student life. Moreover, students have freedom to do things that they want unlike in Thailand that parents always keep their eyes out their students. After the students have graduated from high schools or universities, they also keep contract with other friend around the world. That is very important for their career path in the future. On the other hand, the disadvantages of studying abroad are pretty seroious. Some students are unable to adapt with new environment so they feel home sick. Language barrier is one of the problems when many people study in other countries. It is important to understand about every day communication. When they have to study hard and have no one to consult, they might have mental problem during study. Foreigner people have not been completely accepted in some countries and they have been racist at any time. In my opinion, it is a good chance to study in another country because there are many new experiences but students have to prepare themselves so that they have to face with unexpeted incidence.

Video games have become a staple in our modern, technologically driven culture. While kids have been crazy about these for decades, the introduction of smartphones and mobile gaming systems has pushed them to new heights. Ofen based on fantasy, they also reflect both history and current events. But whether it's a good or bad thing is up to debate. The proponents state that the video game may get unexpected benefits from them, such as better vision. They have been shown to increase players' ability to distinguish the subtle difference in the shade of gray. They may help players improve their ability to detect the direction of movement visually. It was found that gamers spotted targets on a cluttered screen 80% of the time, while non-gamers managed this only 30% of the time. Secondly, video games involve taking risks and the ability to strategize. It teaches patience, perseverance, and the right judgment. It also helps people find new friends and social connections. Besides, gamers become better at critical analysis and learn to concentrate on tasks at hand to completion. Thirdly, It has been found that people are more confident, energetic, and emotionally positive when they play video games, which is exactly the opposite of what depression brings about. People who feel depressed lack physical energy, find it challenging to carry out daily tasks, and are generally pessimistic. Thus, playing can reduce the risk of depression, help with arthritis, and even be a therapeutic option for aphasia. However, the opponents state that there are also plenty of disadvantages of video games. Firstly, video games are designed to be addictive, so it is essential to have some self-control. Especially people with poor impulse control or who have a hard time fitting in are most vulnerable to game addiction. Secondly, video games often act as a replacement for real-time human connections. People who find themselves playing hours upon hours of video games may lose touch with the relationships they've built with other people. Thirdly, Video game addiction could lead to other levels of psychological stress as well. Gamers may suffer from low self-esteem, have social anxieties, or even suffer from depression. Excessive gaming can also inspire feelings of guilt and shame. It is possible that uncontrolled gaming could enhance the signs and symptoms of other mental disorders. Video games are not bad for you as long as you aren't overdoing. So, enjoy your downtime and relax with your games but get out there and keep your life as diverse as possible as well. Because eventually, you have got to win the game of life.

At the end of September 2020, I had a short but fascinating holiday in Switzerland for almost one week. During the summer semester break, I spent all the time to learn programming skills with Python and finish my seminar thesis in the International Finance chair at the University Mannheim. It is quite stressful and challenging for me. Therefore, I need a holiday to relax after that hard time. After the discussion with Max, we have decided to make a short holiday in Switzerland. The reasons are as follows: firstly, compared to the holiday expenses in other European countries, the average costs for a holiday in Switzerland is relatively high. We cannot afford a vacation for longer than one week in Switzerland. Secondly, due to the COVID-19 emergency, there are fewer tourists in Switzerland. It will be more comfortable and less expensive for us to have a holiday there. Thirdly, we only need around 3 hours from Mannheim to Zurich. Therefore, it is very close to us, and we don't need to spend much time on the way. Therefore, we had a fabulous vacation in Switzerland. We have seen the modern city Zurich and the Tourist cities like Luzern and Interlaken during these days. Among all the sightseeings, I like the incredible landscape in Luzern most. It was amazingly beautiful. We have booked a hotel on the mountain with a view of the lake and other peaks. I will never forget this incredible view. In conclusion, this is the best holiday for us.

I really don't think that we should change physical books for electronic books because not all people have the opportunity to get a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Therefore, books aren't too expensive as electronic devices, even books are repositories where you can get information very quickly and more importantly, that information that you're getting was approved by professionals and people that really know about that topic. But the reality is we're living in times where we need to be more ecological and unfortunately books are made principally by trees and looking at the future we're obliged to do a change of physical books to electronic books. There might be people that could think the same that I'm, and the question here is what opinion is correct? In my opinion, I'd like to keep physical books instead electronic books, that's my opinion.

I will always remember visiting the USA for the first time. That was the most exciting holiday I have ever had for several reasons. And, in this writing, I am going to mention the reasons why I do think so. To get started, I would like to point out that it took place when I had just finished my degree. I was quite young and inexperienced then. Nevertheless, somehow I knew it was going to be one of the greatest experiences one person could ever lived. A summer holiday in New York just sounded as perfect as it truly was. Had it not been for the fact that I already had a friend living there, I would have never made the decision of going there that fast. But the truth was that having the support of some close friend who knew well that enormous city, meant the world for me. Visiting New York, the city that never sleeps, simply was as making a dream come true for me. What I first did once I was there was finding a job as a waitress, as I had plans to spend the whole summer holiday there. I met some new friends at my job, and they showed me some important and distinctive places in New York. I remember feeling tiny while I walked around the most famous skyscrapers. I also remember the crowded streets at every single moment, the lights, the singular cabs of the city. It all was magical for me. Nevertheless, there were some drawbacks that should be mentioned as well. Perhaps it was too much time for me to spend far from home for the first time in my life. It was three months missing my family, the food at home, my friends, and, especially, my mother tongue. I was not quite good at English at that moment, I have to admit. Last but not least, I would like to conclude by adding that, even though those downsides, I would certainly recommend this kind of adventure to everyone. Not only did I learn a lot about what living on your own means, but also about myself and how independent and responsible I can actually be.

I think when we are going to answer a question, we have to discuss iabout it from variety of sides. For example wehe we say about video games we need some information about the contest of each play . In my opinion video games in general are not bad and harmful but they can be dangerous for children if parents do not notice kinds of games. If our children play night and day with compuetr it hurts our children . I told about the kind of games: It is so important . Active games are good but frightened plays can hurt the children feeling. Battle is a good thing if you fight with an enemy but children are fighting with unfamiliar creaters. I agree with video gamess but with some conditions. Parents have to control their children and see and know what they play. Governments have to have programs to progress students. Schools corporate with students and parents to have a place at school that students can play there under control of their teachers. The most important thing is we progree level of our children information that they do their best and have a good choice.

In this specific report, I want to focus on improving our writing skills on a platform called Write and Improve.

When I started with Write and Improve my English writing was poorly. I felt insecure about how to start and how to create sentenses in a new language. But, in a few months, with the help and feedback of Write and Improve, I experenced a huge advance.

I think all of the students need to learn a new skill and do a volunteer work . The teaching system in our high schools is established on learning and teaching without using and application our information. When we finish high school we have two chice . first we can go to the market and start a work or we can go to college and countinue our study. In both of them , I think it is better that we have a skill. Imagine that a student after 12 years wants to start a job ? What can he/she can do ? In high school we studied and may have a little experience. It is important that we start a work that we know about that and it is not only familiar for us but also desirable for us. It is possible if we learn the work we want to have it in the future. Or maybe we want to go to the university and countinue our study . Our choice and major will depend on our experience . I suggest that the manager of high schools speak with their students be to be aware of their favorites and make a plan . With experience students will have been succeeded.

Could you imagine our world without the seasons' changes? Would you rather choose the heat of the sun's rays than the power of the fireplaces? Follow me as long as you want to tell you a colourful story! By choice, I find the hottest season of the year more exciting! First of all, summertime always comes with longer days and brighter sunshine in a clear sky, wonderful reasons to become happier. Since the weather is warm and the days are sunny, it's clear the best time to go to the beach or for woodland walk, spending unforgettable summer holidays. On the other hand, the sunlight has a beneficial effect for the plants. Therefore, the trees are full of leaves and many fields are filled with lots of amazing flowers such as sunflowers or lavander. Furthermore, this time is also great for the crops of wheat and corn which wave in the summer breeze and are ripe in July. During the summer some flavorful fruits turn ripe as well: cherries, apricots, peaches, melons. To sum up, my favourite season is revered for its pleasant characteristics, giving us joy and hope!

Hello, I think many teacher can help the students to learn more different skills. More than one teacher means that the students have a chance to benefit more than one teaching type and more than one learning type. The students, who have only one teacher, maybe learn only bad ideas for several years. The possibilities not to have only incorrect way to be brought up are less by having many teacher. The teachers are a big influences on students' character. That id why it must be more than one teacher to let the students be able to learn from many different knowledge sources. The students, who have only one teacher, will become a similare human to the teacher they have. We will not be surprised, if the whole class will have the same career, do the same sport and love doing the same actions. They all will behave others in the same way their teacher behaves. Thanks!

English is a global language that used for formal and informal communication. It becomes a worldwide standard for communication because of two reasons. First, it is easy to learn as compared to many languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Urdu. Second, the number of native English speakers in the total world population is about twenty percent.. Therefore we need to learn it and master it. There are a lot of quality courses available which are free of cost for English learners. One of them is the Oxford English speaking course. The main reason I am learning English is to become successful in my life. In my past, I had encountered the many discrimination because of a poor understanding of English. That gave me a reason to persuade learning English. Now I have been improving my English because of my hard practice.

I think that it is important to learn or speak a foreign language it is compare past. First of all, these days we can travel easily all over the world. Even though we do not go to other countries, we will meet or see other countries people because they will visit our country. They do not know our country so it might be they ask some questions on the street, stations or buildlings. That time, we should answer the question and help them for making good experience or memory in our country. Scoundly, recently our job styles are changing. For example, another country boss come to our company or we need to communicate with other countries people or companies. Unless we speak other countries language, it will be difficult to get or raise a good position. For there reason, I really believe that we have to learn or speak to other countries language which is important more than past.

As we are living in a liberal democracy, based on values like free choice and individualism, I strongly oppose the idea of coercing students to do sports. Although a healthy and active lifestyle is crucial for a both long and fulfilled life, I do think that nobody should by obliged to do sports. Rather than deciding about the way other people should live their lives, we should try to dig deeper and mitigate the underlying causes of bad health. In my opinion the probably best way to achieve this is by vastly increasing the spending on nutritional education. Even the youngest members of our society must know the negative side effects of certain foods and be able to differentiate between healthy and potentially damaging ingredients. Furthermore we have to highly step up our efforts of reaching poorer families in less affluent neighbourhoods with programs like free sports courses for children under the age of five. In this way children get used to doing sports, because they would not know a life without sports. Imaging for a second that we as a society achieved both aims. Erudite, sporty young people know exactly what to eat and behave accordingly, therefore programs like forced sports classes would not be necessary anymore. Obviously we could do a lot more than that, starting from free, healthy lunch at school and ending probably with incentivising the location of medical practicionars in rural areas, for the benefit of our descendants. However all of these measures need the backing of a broad political majority, which is not accomplished easily and needs further engagement from all of us in debates at every level of politics. Finally I can only repeat my pledge to oppose any type of forced sports classes decisively, and to subsitute them with early education programs for everyone.

There is no doubt that besides entertains, television can also educate. It is possible to find a large number of programs with all kinds of content. It is possible to learn about cooking, a new language, how to improve any kind of study and many others options. All the other hand, people have to have control on account of the large variety of programs that television offers. Any distraction can disturb the principal goal of studying. To sum up, it is very easy to find any program of studying on television. Although it is very easy to find some distraction as well. A person who wants to learn something through television has to be very self-centered and determined or he or she will be one more victim that spends a lot of time in front of the television, and the person will be the famous "coach potato."

November 2, 2020 The Town Council My Dear Town Council: The freedom of free exercise is guaranteed to every American citizen by the First Amendment of the Constitution. However, this freedom is at odds with a recently proposed idea to ban mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I disagree with the banning of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Firstly, all citizens are guaranteed the freedom of free exercise. So, the Town Council cannot ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants unless people are doing something against the law. So, the Town Council cannot implement this ban because it goes against the First Amendment. This is a major reason why I disagree with banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In addition, mobile phones make it easier for people to pay for goods, services, food, and public transport. If the Town Council implemented this ban, then people would have to carry lots of coins and paper currency whenever they want to buy something at a shop or eating at a restaurant. This means that if this ban is carried out, it would make people's lives much harder. This is another reason why is disagree with banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In summary, I disagree with the ban of the usage of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants both because it is against the Constitution, and that it makes people's lives harder. I hope that the Town Council rethink their decision and cancel this ban after reading this letter. Yours sincerely, Daniel

Some people think that it is a good idea for people not to lie, while others say it is acceptable not to speak truth. However, I believe that every individual should try to speak the truth always because it would help people to build a connection of trust between each other, I think it is acceptable to speak lie when it do not hurt other people. On the one hand, some think that it is necessary to always speak the truth. This is because people can build a strong bond between each other by speaking the truth always and this type of connections mostly does not break. For instance, a 2015 report by UK government found that the pupils aged between 5 and 12 shares have strong friendship than young people because children's does not lie as young people do. So I agree it is very important to try not to lie to others, especially to loved ones. Other people would say that sometimes, it is okay to speak lie rather than truth. One reason for this is that in some situations where truth will hurt and can have a negative impact in one's life. For example, according to extensive research, couples sometime lie to save their marriage. I think it should be acceptable to not speak the truth always. To conclude, although views differ whether it is okay for people to lie sometimes, I would argue every individual must try to speak the truth first which allow people to share healthy bond.

It's called "Hairspray" (have you watched this before? If you haven't, please, sit down and play in on right now!). This movie talks about a teeneager girl who dreams to be a superstar in her smalltown, Baltimore. But there's a "problem": she's fat. Thoughout the movie, more important subjects are addressed, such as racism, poverty and joviality. All the characters are very strong and the best part: it's a musical!

Some people think that it is necessary to learn a foreign language skills as it was earlier, while others say it is of no benefit nowadays . I believe that it is more important these days to have other languages because it provides an opportunity to make new friends and help to get good pay skill job. One reason for this is that people travel cross borders to experience new cultures. Knowing language of other countries help people to fill a communication gap so that people can interact with each other freely and become friends. For instance, a survey by France government found that people who know foreign langauge can make new friends easily and enjoies the culute at bestof that country when compared to people who know native language. Therefore, I think foreign language are more important and should be taught from middle schools. Another reason why I think that language is of so much benefit because it is easy for people to enquire and do business between countries which doesn't share common language. For example, a report by China government found that people who want to do business hire an agent or use translators just to commuincate with local people, in return agents charge a lot of money. Companies can save a lot of money just by leanring that particular language. In conclusion, although it may not be easy for people to learn other langauge, I believe it can help to explore the new countires and open a bridge between countires to export and import.

The School of the future is going to be very different than nowadays, I am not sure if it will change to better or to worst, but the only thing I am hundred percent sure is that it will be different. The main reason why I believe in that, is because the technology has a big influence in all subjects in the world, and the School is going to be influentiated by technology as the other subjects. If we compare the School now with School some years ago we can see that it has changed a lot. For example, not many years ago the teachers used to use a giz to write on a blackboard, but now they normally use a pen or an electronic board, where they don't need to use any pen at all. The most important thing is, the School is going to be better? The way used to teaching is going to be more efective than now? These are questions that we can't answer now, we just will be prepared to say if the changes were good or not when the future come.

Nowadays there are more options for studying and improving the preparation than to the past. In spite of the evolution of the school arrangements, there are always advantages and drawbacks as well. Thus, what are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad? Firstly, a student, who has studied abroad at least some months, has major job opportunities than other students. In fact, the most important societies and industries of the world have been always searching for a young graduate with this background. Secondly, studying abroad improves own language skills, English in this case. It is verified by various research studies, which stated that going abroad for study or work helps to learn fast a foreign language. Moreover, it can make a person feel more confident, with an improvement in the social relationships. However, there are also some possible drawbacks. For example, it comes out great costs, from the economic point of view. Therefore, a further issue might be the distance between the student and his family. It is not so easy leaving all and going to another country, totally different and so far from home! It corresponds to break all of our habits and start again. It takes a lot of time to get used to a new different (and strange sometimes) lifestyle. In any case, it is an incredible experience that can change our own life and will remain in our mind forever. It is worth absolutely.

Do not ban the use of mobile phones in public places I am writing this letter because I saw your article this morning about your idea to ban mobile phones out of restaurants and other public places. I would like to share my opinion about this idea, so you can hopefully change your mind. The first thing to mention is that all people in this country are free to choose where they want to use their mobile phone. Using a mobile phone in public places is not a crime and therefore it could not be banned. Besides this, a lot of people use their phone for functional purposes. For example, when an employee has a work meeting with an empoyer they can meet each other at the workplace, but it is also possible that one of them works in a restaurant and the other one works from home. In this case they need to call each other. For this reason, it would be very impractical when phones are not allowed anymore in restaurants. When I was reading your letter I could understand what your intention was to ban mobile phones. I was feeling your frustration when I read your letter about the fact that everyone is on every moment only focused on their screen. This means that nobody is making new contacts anymore when they are, for example on their way. Also, the social aspect in a restaurant or shop disappears, because people do not talk to each other anymore. But in this case, I would like to suggest making people aware of their actions instead of to ban phones from public places. In conclusion, I have noticed your letter and I would be aware of my actions in the future, but I do not think it is a well taken decision to forbid mobile phones from public places.

Some prefer to live longer without adventures. Others, however, are concerned that once in a lifetime means there is no second chance. Thus, they would attempt to challenge everything as they can and go on adventures, when they are living in the world. As far as I am concerned, living an exciting and extraordinary life is more valuable than long term but boring life. There are several points that will be addressed below. Firstly, lost time is never found again. No one can predict whether afterlife exists or not; therefore, we should seize the moment and try to challenge the unknown when we are young. Those difficulties and challenges we have conquered are turning into unforgettable memories in our life eventually. Additionally, human beings are fickle. Some people choose a peaceful life at first. However, when they are dying, they start regretting countless things they have not done before. Those people who desire to live in peace and quiet would avoid doing unpredictable actions which may bring unstable and risk factors into their life. However, once people are getting older, they still need to face health issues. For instance, some old people may have dementia or they are out of action. It not only brings problems but also becomes a part of the burden to their families and offspring. Thus, it seems living too long still may not have a good quality of life even though the life is peaceful. To conclude, everyone will face the end of human’s life, thus the quality of life is more important than quantity, and we should value quality.

Most people watch exciting shows or movies on television to entertain themselves. The question is whether TV can also be used for educational purposes. Regarding this topic, opinions are mainly divided into two groups. Some of them think that we can use television for education. Others argue that television is dominantly used for entertainment, and it is difficult to use it for education. The supporters state that we can use various television programs to educate our children or accelerate our knowledge about the new field. For instance, there are plenty of English learning programs or basic cognitive training programs for children. They are well designed for children with many funny features to learn new knowledge and are not dull. Furthermore, there are also many different documentation videos for adults to extend their horizons. However, opponents argue that it is quite challenging to implement this ideal concept with television. Since there are so many obstructions when watching TV. For example, they pay much more attention to funny scenarios than the content. Furthermore, many advertisements disrupt children from learning. Finally, most children, as well as adults, are more likely to use televisions to watch shows or movies than learn new knowledge.

Among all the seasons, winter is my favourite. Just think about Christmas, snow and Santa Claus. Winter is the best season to relax. For example, after returning to school you decide to cover yourself in a blanket and sip a cup of hot chocolate, while you are watching TV. This is something that never happens in other seasons. I love watching streets covered in snow. Also when Christmas is approacching I really like to see decorations on trees, people walking wearing warm clothes because it is really cold outside. I think that winter is my season because I really love being warm while outside the weather is freezing. These little things are what I like to see.

I want the school improve library because all students use this place every day. The library should have enough private tables for students and provide meeting rooms for group learners. The librarians have to organise meeting rooms by online booking. This method is a very easy and convenience for every student. For the learning area, I am pleased with the comfortable environment like worm and cozy room. The school should renovate some rooms by repainting, or changing furniture. Science equipment in chemistry and physics laboratories should be changed. Student will improve their skills and knownledge when they do a lot of science experiments in a good laboratory.

To: Glenda Smith, English teacher at West Academy From: Michelle Inglis Subject: A new school year Introduction This report describes what should be done to achieve our goals in this new school year. Reading skills To begin with, our reading skills have been practised for ages and we are pleased to see that we can now understand longer and more complex texts about wide variety of topics. Listening, speaking and writing skills On the other hand, more listening, speaking and writing practice must be added in order to use English more effectively and do well in our studies. Working hard for achieving our goals More specifically, we are expected to listen as many as possible audio recordings to help us understand extended speech about unfamiliar topics. In addition, we might improve our writing by analysing different written assignments. Moreover, as long as we practise our conversational skills in pairs or groups, we will communicate better and we might become more fluent speakers. Conclusion To sum up, I believe that if the above recommendations are carried out, our English level will be improved considerably and all our goals will be achieved.

My favorite indoor activity is cleaning. I like cleaning all my home and organised all my objects. I enjoy this activity because it makes me to feel better. It is like a meditation process. Usually I clean and organise my stuff when I fell angry or when I think I need some time to relax. The last time when I clean it was last week.

I like to exercise. I exercise about three or four times by week. I work out lots of different sports, for example: running, hiking, swimming and dancing. So, I can work out to inside and outside. I don't get afraid from the raining weather. I like to practise in the wind, or to enjoy a sunny weather. I like feeling the air on my skin, on my body. After my exercise, I'm feeling relax, happy and fit. Almost, I will get ready to exercise again.

It'd be interesting to observe, but I doubt you can charge someone with not going outside. That's simply not feasible. Although I'm fully aware about these "society diseases" and openly support the sane lifestyle, even though I'm no fanatic. You can't expect the people to just rise from whatever place they're sitting and go playing football, or something similar. And of course, yes, I know we are discussing about the schools, and other similar institutions, where this could be somehow possible to require, but think about that. It's completely included in the capabilities of schools and universities, to proceed with the standart P. E. classes, in this case, I would simply augment the time-dotation. If it isn't satisfying the requirements, or the effect is not perceptable, the best thing to do is upgrade the sistem of lectures, simply innovate in this field, and bring some new procedures, techniques, if we're talking directly about the sports, than develop or involve some new games etc. . From my point of view, the most recognizable, acceptable and cheaper way should be the starting a brand whole new campaign, with massive proportions, and range. I'd make her effective, than of course affective, in a friendly way (we don't need any violence). It should appelate on the people, give them new insights. You have to motivate the crowds! For me this is the most compromising way. I cannot agree with the introducted statement, we can't directly force anyone. This could be acceptable, let's say, maybe during the war, or other similar events, when a capable population is expected, and you can easily reshape young people. But it shouldn't be done this way. It's way too drastical and unnecessary.

Health or wealth? With the development of new technology and society, the amount of consumption goods to meet human demand increases dramatically. Meanwhile, more and more people are driven by their consumption desires and want to work harder to get richer. It is interesting to discuss whether health is more important than wealth. Some argue that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Others disagree with it. However, the answer to this question depends on various factors, such as individual financial situation, the comprehension of social security, value choice, and personality. Since these factors vary for different people and countries, it is no wonder that people have different preferences. For instance, most employees work around 72 hours per week in China. Because they usually have high expenses and mortgage debt to pay. Furthermore, there is no adequate social security. Chinese must save money for themselves and their parents, just in case. As a result, many people have already been suffering from various health problems at a very young age. In a fast-developing society, it is hard for people who are not driven by overwhelming consumption desire. Therefore, most Chinese decide to work harder to get richer. Nevertheless, many German choose another lifestyle than Chinese. Many German decide to have a fun and relaxing job and have a better work-life balance. Most people in Germany work no more than 40 hours per week. Some of them even only work 20 hours weekly to have more free time for their family or their hobbies. Because social security in Germany is relatively comprehensive and sufficient, people don't have so much uncertainty to worry about.

Some people believed that health is crucial than wealth, I also have the same concept as them. Money cannot buy health despite having the ability to acquire the best medical system, however; money is earned through hard work. If our health is affected, how would we be able to concentrate on our work to bring back the bacon home? Therefore, it is vital that we remain healthy so we can focus on our work to put food on the table. Nowadays, there is a rapid growth of competition in the market as the world is constantly changing, thus people are fighting to keep their jobs and solve their bread and butter issue forgetting how important their health in a stressful environment. Being overworked can lead to health problem such as fatigue, increase chance of having hypertension and other health problems. But there are some health problems that are incurable take Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) despite nation pouring money into research it has yet to find a cure. On the other hand, health can bring joy in our life for an example, if someone is on a trip enjoying parties and all sort of crazy thing while being healthy but all of the sudden he fell ill not being able to spend his last few days on wonderful trip, everything will turn into anguish. Furthermore, if you were healthy, you would be able to gain wealth. The reverse is not possible. Health gives you the ability to enjoy what life has to offer and create experiences that are often more cherished that physical goods. Therefore, I conclude that health is more important that money although money can bring joy to some people life but greed will one day overcome them turning them into a demon

In recent years, more and more people join universities or colleges after they graduated from senior high schools. However, the university life is totally different from senior high school life or before that. About the concern of living at home or not, my opinions is followed. As for me, moving away and living on their own while attending the university or college is a better choice than living at home. In the late of the student life, living outside can learn and acquire more skills and knowledge than living at home. Before entering the workforce, undergratuates not only have to learn the professional skills but the social skills and self-care ability. Undergratuates can learn or acquire these competence more quickly if they move away and live on their own. They need to do everything by themeselves, such as go to classes, mop floor, wash clothing, and so on. Therefore, living outside may learn more than living at home.

Regarding the question: Exercise is essential for our health, but are there more important things, opinions among people are quite different since each one has his own preference. For instance, I would like to say that money is more important for me than exercise; even regular exercises are necessary to keep healthy. However, it doesn't mean that I don't do any exercise at all, and health doesn't matter for me. Due to the stressful financial situation and high living expenses, I have no choice but to work harder to get more money to finance it. Therefore, compared to exercise, I will prioritize work. Nevertheless, I usually do Zumba workout every week to keep me fit. Since if I am not fit and always sick, I cannot finish my task as planned. However, some may disagree with me. Health has absolutely the highest priority for them. Therefore, there is nothing else that is more important than exercise. And such people usually have a perfect work-life balance.

Exercise is important for everybody health. Not only exercise but also diet and good mental health are composition to have a good living. People should exercise at least 30 minutes for 3-5 days per week and they also have to have a healthy food. The healthy food for me is food having a lot of nutreints and fresh. In order to have a good health, people should have a range of friuts, vegetables and meat every day and avoid ready to eat food, canned food, soft drink and fast food. Nowadays, most people are interested in plant-based whole food that most diet come from plant. People can eat protein from other sources of high protein plant instead of meat. This diet can improve human health better. For having a good metal health, there are many medthods can help you like doing meditation on free time, travelling on vacation time, not being stressful.

It isn't good for animals. They should live in really live. They need space. Wild animals also have their space. There is no animal which lives in the zoo and had as much space as they do when they live in the wild. Secondly, zoo animals are also living creatures. They just like humans. We also wouldn't like it if we have to spend the rest of our lives in a cave. Waiting to eat when the caregiver gives it. We like to move and eat whenever we can, so does zoo animals.

Write & Improve is an online platform provided by the Cambridge Language Assistment. It helps an English student (or learner in general) to improve his vocabulary and writing skills. In my opinion It is very helpful and stimulating because, for example, it can check the written text and give some advice about it. This feedback is good for a self-taught and for every English learner. Moreover, W&I is characterized by many examples and models of a possible Writing test. In fact, there is a so called 'Test zone'. Furthermore, there are W&I workbooks, in order to train daily with different topics: from sport to study, from environment to technologies and so on. These workbooks are divided by sections, which depend on the English level: Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced. Who wants improve his business English, there is also a section called 'W&I Business'. However, I don't like the restricted number of simulation of Writing Test. Completing all the 'free' topics, the others are blocked. If you want unlock them, you should pay. If I were my classmates, I would start using Write & improve. I recommend it to everybody.

It is proved that playing video games help to improve coordination, multitasking skills and enhancing memory; for these reasons, video games are a good tool to get distracted and to develop children's brain speed . In contrast, the abuse of these games platforms is negative to children who spend their whole day playing video games such as triggering violence, bad performance in schools and health problems like anxiety, obesity or stress.

The future of Travel Nowadays there are already various ways to travel, for instance, by busses, trains or flights. It is already much faster than travelling in the middle ages as people usually travelled with carriages. And it was very slow, and the journey was more likely limited regional. Due to the dramatic development of technology and further travel demand, future travel is expected to be faster, cheaper, and more comfortable. For instance, it is not difficult to imagine that typical vehicles such as self-driving cars that can fly will be widely used in the future. This new vehicle can be used not only for a short-distance trip but also for a long-distance journey. Correspondingly, international trips will be more personalized and flexible, since almost everyone could fly in his car. And this new change may decrease the usage of large flights dramatically. Furthermore, the Outer space travel with spacecraft may also come true, and the trip for humans will not be limited on the earth anymore. Finally, with the further application of virtual reality technology in travels and works, it is reasonable to imagine that people will do the real trip less and virtual one more.

Medicine is one of the fannest major around the world , but in some countries it is a bridge to successment to earn a lot of money and social character . The opinion and culture of each area makes their attitude ,so first we have to detecte their culture and believes. Unfortunately , a lot of medical doctors are forgotten their oath and only think about money and easy life. In my opinion ,some of the important reasons for this decision are: 1- Money is important and has the most important role in their life. 2 - They are not responsible for their society. 3 - Rural areas have less facilities. 4 - The policy of governments that have to forced them to work in rural region. If we want to change their attitude ,we have to forced them and they have to sign a paper that they will be go to rural areas for at least one year.

Imagine that, being a centenarian, but feel like in your middle sixties. I'm not afraid of that. When these demands are fulfilled, I am for the first option. I just like my pace. Maybe I used to be a bit ferocious, but how many people in their teenage years didn't? There is no need to live your life intensively, without any sleep, practically surviving from day to day. In my humble opinion, settling down, eventually don't moving a house much, having a good wife, husband or any other partner, maybe make some kids, Doing a stable and prospering job, going for the culture, simply fighting with the life normally. You may enjoy the rush, adrenalin and joy of your short life, but it's important to realize that anyone of us can hide a great potential. In your later life, some people can contribute to this society so much and although some geniuses have died rellatively young, they can't be the majority.

Vehicles play a vital role in human's life. Because we use vehicles for travelling . Today,many scientists are trying to fix the problem of road congestion as there has been a large increase in the number of cars on the road. They are figuring out how to decrease traffic congestion and road congestion. According to Dr.Paul, they have invented a flying car in order to reduce traffic congestion for the future. As the world is progressing, in the future you can expect self-driving cars on the road. Besides these kinds of cars,they are planning to build smart roads in order to decrease accidents and road deaths. I think that this is the future of the whole world. Nonetheless, I think airplanes will be remaining the same although other ways of travel can change in the future. Because, travelling by planes is convenient. It is the best way to travel one country to another. To sum up, even if flying cars and self-driving cars were able to be invented in the future, we cannot say if life will be convenient because everything comes with ease and also drawbacks.

I am an 18 years old student and studying English for almost 6 years now. For a long time, I was looking for a tool which may help me to improve my English writing skills because they are awful. But most of the programs or tools are expensive and as a student I cannot pay them. A time ago, I found "Write and Improve." It is a tool which is organised by Cambridge University and absolutely great. First of all, it is almost free. You can use most of the tools without paying anything. Depending on your English skills, you can choose between different difficulties. They are called workbooks in which you find, depending on your indiviual level, tasks for practising. After doing a task, you receive immediately feedback from the program. It includes your English level and mistakes you made. However, you can find a test zone for some exams Cambridge University offers. If you want, you also can create own workbooks. In my opinion this tool is really good if you want to improve your English or prepare yourself for an exam. It will not replace a real teacher because it is only a program but for the beginning it might be helpful. If you decide to sign in in the mailing list, you will also receive a lot of helpful tipps. I can recommend Write and Improve but also have to say there might be better ones if you are ready to pay some money for a good program like grammarly.

Some people frown upon some kinds of programs such as Game show and advertisements because they think a lot of advertisements are a form of lying and they can make people feel depressed and discontented with their ordinary lives,especially those people who have only a small amount of money to spend on luxuries . And parents do not want their children to spend so much time watching Game show. On the other hand,I think that we can benefit from watching programs such as Drama,wildlife documentary and educational show . Moreover,you can relax by watching Comedy or something like that when you are mentally tired . What's more,people still get their news primarily from TV,and a few cartoons intended to kids can also teach a couple of things:some moral principles and some lessons. In conclusion, as far as I know, television can not only entertain but also educate us. It is a win-win situation.

Nowadays, in our Digital Age, with easy access to online translation services, knowing more languages is still as valuable as it was in other times. Personally, I think that, even now, it is worth learning a new language. Firstly, although a computer program could help you with some translation, it is often poor and unnatural. Therefore, you might be lost in translation. That is why I'd rather learn a new language than using a translation software. Secondly, what can be more pleasant than traveling? But, our experience wouldn't be enjoyable unless we had communicated with local people. Even if we didn't know their mother tongue, we could at least use one of the most spoken language in the world. Moreover, learning a foreign language might broaden our horizons. For instance, we can find more up-to-date information in numerous fields of activity. Last but not least, multilingualism is good for our health since the grey cells are activated by language-learning and, as a consequence, it improves memory and reduces the effects of brain ageing. In conclusion, I definitely believe that are lots of reasons for learning a new language even these days.

Zoos are one of the best places for people to not only relax but also learn about our nature. These facilities are significantly important for children to develop. While many people argue that animals belong in nature and they should not be kept in zoos, I strongly believe that zoos also bring many benefits. Firstly, zoos are good places for entertainment. Going to the zoos at the weekend or on holidays is one of the most popular ways many families choose to relax. This activity helps maintain the relationships among family members. For example, after a stressful week of studying and working, parents and children will have a great time at the zoo. They will have a change to do things together such as feeding animals, walking along the street like in the forest, or learning about the exotic animals. Also, these activities are really important to the development of children. Secondly, it will be more convenient for those who want to learn about animals because they do not have to go directly to the forest where there are many potential threats. Take African elephants as an example, when you want to learn about them, you only need to go to the zoo where elephans are kept without going to Africa. Furthermore, the study of animals at the zoo is more effective because there are many people who has their specialty in nature. In conclusion, although animals are actually belong to the nature and they should be free, we need zoos because these places helps us know more about animals and nature. Since then, people will be more responsible with nature and they will find ways to protect animals.

The computer games industry has enjoyed great success in the last two decades. Only very young people played them twenty years ago, but now it is a common form of entertainment. I must also mention that not only young people play computer games, but also middle-aged and elderly people. However, is it really safe to let your children play video games? In my opinion parents should check if a particular game is suitable for their children. It is easy to find a game with a lot of violence or improper content that shouldn't be displayed by children. On the other hand, some of the games may have very positive impact on the children. They develop creativity. I believe that playing games may be more beneficial than wathich TV programmes. I think that games producers should clearly categorize their games, so it wouldn't be difficult to decide is it proper for the children.

It seems like there is a divide between school having students not to take any music class and school forcing students to study and learn to play a musical instruemnet. Given such divide, it seems plausible that we should let student choose what to study depending on whether he or she likes music. Surely, there is a scientistic fact that music can develop students' imagination and preception. Besides focuing on acdemic studies, music can relieve students pressure and can have a fair judgement. However, it is not always true that every student has an interest in studying or learning music. By involving music in a requirement could increase students' burden in studying, and therefore, it could affect his or her academic performance in other subjects. Rather he or she likes music or not, the choice should be up to student preference instead of forcing them to choose what to study or what to learn. Otherwise, it could have a negative impact on students' development.

I think "The Future of Travel" should be Eco-Tourism. Travelling produces a carbon footprint which affects the environment every year. In my opinion, people must concern about this effect. A carbon footprint comes from travelling and waste of tourism so Eco-Tourism is one of the best options that the toursists can choose in order to save the places where they have gone to. Wherever you go, you should help and keep those places be clean like the same. For example, a lot of litters from the tourism are cause of many problems in local areas. Moreover, animals, native people and surroudings have been affected by smell and sore sightseeing. For this reason, the travellers have to look after things around them and support the local people to cultivate consciousness of loving their hometowns. If other people pay attention of tourist attracttions, the inhabitants will love and cherish their habitats. It is good for everyone who want to travel to any place and have a value attitude about saving the enviromnent. Sustainability of the suroundings is the sustainability of travel too.

What places do you usually go for a holiday? My family usually go to a nearby forest for a holiday. I cannot understand why they always go to the forests for a holiday. But the holiday we went on last week was amazing. We went to a forest as usual. But this forest was very different from the previous ones we had gone. It was the best holiday I ever had. There were loads of lakes for us to swim in and they even had horses. I love horse riding but my favourite thing about the holiday was the cabins we stay in. It was like being in a tree house and we got to stay up late,and eat chocolate, and drink soda. There were some kinds of animals in the forest. I saw rabbit, peacock, monkey and some kinds of birds. Some people brought their dogs and played with them around their tent. The moment I looked at them playing with the dogs,I though myself that I should have a dog because they are so cute. And at night, we played truth or dare. I love this game because it is so funny, especially, the dares. I always choose dares whenever I play this game as I do not want anyone to know my secrets. While we were playing, some people next cabin joined us. And the game was much more fun than a while ago. We got to know each other and I made new friends. That's why it was the best holiday I ever had. In conclusion, this holiday amazingly raised my spirit. I hope I can go on such holiday again.

Scientists have proved that exercise brings us many benefits. Doing frequent exercises makes our life a lot better because it improves both mental and physical health. However, there are still many things that are indispensable in life such as relationships and knowledge because these things play important roles in the success of a person. Firstly, a person cannot live without a network. Every one of us belongs to a certain group of people. Since we were born, we lived with our families. We go to schools, we have friends and teachers. And, when we work, we belong to our companies. That makes humans different from animals because we have society and social interaction. The person we have become today is the result of all the interactions with the people we have met. For example, if a child lives with a good and wealthy family, there will be more chances for the child to become a good person in the future. Knowledge is also a powerful tool for humans. This helps us resolve our problems and develop into a valuable person. This factor is also crucial to the success of people.

In my opinion the offices must have an open and ergonomic design, with no walls separating employees from their co-workers in order to the create the best environment for their employees. First of all, it is known that the most successful companies which have won the awards as the best place to work, they care for the places' design where their workers performance their activities every day; they don't have walls separating the peers, because they consider that walls can mean a line which restrict the collaboration and creativity inside the company, hence the rate of new strategies and new plans of actions reduces. Apart from that, it is known that workplace design is an opportunity for companies to promote social wellness and productivity. Hence, it is ideal for a lean and green company to have no walls in the offices so as to foster an environment with more fairness, equality and freedom to express ideas. Adittionally, when designing an office, companies are contibuting to a key element which is the health of workers not only physical but also mentally. So, according to some studies the spaces where the people work must be wide enough to allow them walk and clear their minds so as to reduce the stress levels, increase the creativity and to promote the movement in their sedentary lives. On the top of that, it is claimed if the offices have ergonomic designs the productivity of the workers improves due to the collaborators feel more comfortable and satisfied, I would like to drive home this vital part, when workers don't have worries about the space where they have to work or they don't have negative feelings about the discomfort and their metal load reduces as a result they can focus on what they're doing and have more energy for the activities, as well as they leverage their sinergy in teamwork. Finally, I think the spaces for offices should be wide and ergonomic for the administrative employees, in order to promote the efficiency, creativity and productivity. Added to that, the design office is vital for the simple reason that physical workplaces have a huge impact on a wide variety of factors like inclusion, morale, health, producivity and efficient in collaborators.

Music is surrounding human life. Music is a magic thing that listening to music and playing musical instruments can change our mind. Nevertheless, is everyone familiar with music and should everyone needs to know about it? My answer is yes. In Taiwan, we have music classes in the basic education period which provided every student the basic knowledge of music. However, why should we study music? As I said earlier, music is a magic thing. There are many kinds of music, such as classic, pop, jazz, bassa nova, and so on, and it always can lead us into the different mood. In my mind, "music" is one of the greatest way to release the pressure. Through singing songs, listening to music, we may feel happier and immerse ourselves in relaxed atmosphere. Besides, there is a slang in Chinese "Children who study music won't go bad." The research had showed that the kids who study music have higher stable emotion, concentration and lower nervouseness. Studying music has a lot of benefits but without any cons. Let everyone gets to know more about music. People may find the changes from themselves.

This is the reason I still live at my parents, it is way cheaper than living on your own. Some students prefer living on their own and choose to loan money. However, they not only have to loan money to pay their rent, but also for grocery, gas, water, light, etcetra. When you live in your own you have more freedom. You don't have to think about somebody else. You can eat whenever you like, listen to music whenever you want or watch a Netflix show you like.

Some people think that it is better to live a long and stable life while, other prefer to have a short and happening life. I believe that it is important to be peaceful and friendly because it allows you to pass your traditions to the next generation and stay close with your family members. To begin with, I believe that it is better to have long calm as it allow people to find out some spare time so that they can spend quality time with the family members. This would allow them to care of their loved ones and, help them to become a successful and better person. In other words, if they spend more time with family members they get close to each other and as a result, they start enjoying their life. For example, in 2002, Oxford University conducted a survey between people who live with family member and separate and found that individuals who have with their families are much happier than other people. Another important point to consider is that people can share their thoughts and beliefs as well as traditions with the next generation ,so that family members know their history of ancestors. This means that generations will keep on passing the traditions from one to another to keep themselves motivated towards living a healthy life. To illustrate this, studies by India government have found that the majority of families know their traditions mainly because people spend time with their family . To conclude, although people are so busy these days that they like to live an intense life, I think long calm life help people to live together and share their thought and beliefs.

These two things we can only find in some channels but today is very difficult to make programmes like this. So when you are tired after work you can choose channel dedicated to entertainment. When you would like to learn something new you can find channels about history, politics or engineering.

There are many means of transport which have been used for generations, but they are becoming obsolute and replaced by technological advances. I strongly believe that public transport and more environmentally friendly vehicles will be used poluparly in the future because these new technologies help mankind to cope with problems related to the environment, climate change and the growth of polulation. Firstly, using public transport is beneficial for both the environment and the economic situation of people. For example, buses can carry a large group of people at the same time, which reduces the number of vehicles on the street. This will also decrease the carbon emissions significantly. Also, bus tickets are quite cheap compared to gasoline prices. In addition, this means of transport also helps resolve traffic congestion, which will save time of many people. Secondly, the development of technology also affects how people travel. Bateries are now more efficient than in the past. There are many cars which use electricity instead of fossil fuel. People are realized how servere climate change is, so they will use electric vehicles to travel rather than the classic ones to protect the environment.

There are some who believe that taking up sports activity at least three times a week is beneficial for all types of students. This is because, nowadays, students tend to have an inactive lifestyle. I totally agree with this as due to inactive lifestyle, students face a lot of problems and by doing physical activities they will achieve good health and live healthily. In recent times, many youngsters tend to do less physical activity than ever before. Not opting for an active lifestyle is displayed in their eating habits too; as they usually prefer to order readymade or fast food items online. One reason for this could be that after spending a busy day at university they feel exhausted; so they do not want to spend time for cooking. Due to this, a lot of health issues are being observed in younger population, for instance, they feel exhausted even if they performed a minor physical exercise . Also, they are not very keen to adopt an active lifestyle and just try to do all sorts of work on their gadgets. Therefore, forcing them to do physical activity at least a couple of times a week is good for their physical health. That being said, indulging in physical activities has a lot of health benefits for an individual. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted by The General Health magazine, revealed that people who had an active lifestyle from their childhood days tend to live a healthy and long life. Therefore, it is really needed that students must be motivated to perform physical activities several times a week. This will help to keep a check on many lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and obesity, which are now very common in youngsters. Also, if students take part in physical activity by indulging into sports then it helps to build team spirit in them. In this way, it is beneficial to perform physical activities for both good physical and mental health. In conclusion, leading an inactive lifestyle could lead to complications in later life. A simple method to control it is indulging in physical activity from an early age itself.

Thinking about how to live is one of the most interesting subjects for human beings. While some desire to have a long life spam, in my opinion, it is more exciting to live in an adventure life. The main reason to choose a short but intense life is that living in a severe situation can motivate people to live more productive. It means have a calm condition can be boring after a while and stop making a plan for the future. For example, for a few years I experiensed a situation which was without any problems, but after a while I realized that I did not any useful work for my future. What is more, facing with the challenges and new things can open our horizon and improve the way of thinking. According to a survey on Oxford University, living in the tough condition can develop the creativity of people. For instance, there are some examples of the famous individuals in the world who have had worse condition in their early life, but could pass that life and became popular. Having said taht, human beings like trying immortality to see the future. As a result some perefer living calm and long to face with unknown events. I think this exuse cannot be enough to forget about endevouring new changes. In conclusion, although some prefer having a long life without any trobles, in my view, short life but full of new experienses, is more enthusiastic for people.

In the city, we are exposed to exhaust gas and especially in the winter we are exposed to coal gas which uses for heating in some homes. So clean air is a blessing for us. When we were hungry, we barbecued. That was very yummy. You can attend us for hiking next afternoon. I'm sure you will be delighted. See you later.

I went to Panama when I was 10 years old. I saw lots of interesting things like The Panama Canal. It is a famous landmark of human engineering which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to create an essential sea route. This gives the possibility of being a short and cheap transit route for ships responsible for transporting goods. I also went to an island called Chichime that belongs to a region called Guna Yala. Guna Yala is an indigenous region in Panama, inhabited by the Guna ethnic group. There I pass two days I swam in the sea and walked through the island. I have been into the Biomuseum, too. It is a natural history museum that is located in Panama City. Its intention is to change the way we see, understand and keep nature and its biodiversity. It was my favourite trip because I learnt a lot of new and amazing things about the world.

Not onlt a life full of adventures but also a life full of hard work and strict deadlines. Take that in to consediration this definition I would prefer a calm life.

Should we liberate all animals? In the 21st century, many environmental movements have gained popularity. Some of them have been proposing deleting the zoos. They argue that all the living creatures should be free and deserve better treatment. Are we supposed to open the gates and set the lions and other creatures free? It's an issue we should discuss. Environmental movements claim that animals can be happy only when they live in their natural environment. Personally, I disagree with this view . In my opinion animals that live in the zoos are the lucky ones. They are safe and have food and don't worry that some predator may eat them tomorrow. Although, sometimes it is sad to see such a majestic animal as a tiger that is kept behind bars. But we should remember that by doing this, we help to preserve some kinds of animals. For example, pandas would not have survived if we had not kept them in the zoo. Moreover, I think that children can learn something by going to the zoo. In the future they may become nature lovers. In conclusion, I think that the zoos should continue to exist. This is the solution I would recommend.

I think students have new teachers each year. Why? Thera are a lot of reasons. I want to give you several example. It does not matter which you are a grade. You can be a pupil or a university student. If you have the same teacher every year you cannot learn a different perspective. On condition that students have particular teacher they can discover different things. Second the same teacher does not establish an authority on them. The Authority is essential for an education. If the teacher has not the authority them can be rekless. In other words them do not listen to the teacher. This situation is perilous. For example if the teacher lost to control on them he/ she cannot the teach anything them. On the other sometimes the students face to face some risk if them have different teacher each year. The new teacher cannot be good like the old teacher. Finally the students have a new teacher each year.

Video games are one of the most used medium of entertainment at the moment. They are loved by children, who used them more and more. However people are divided by different points: someone believes that video games are dangerous for health. On the other hand, somebody stated how video games are useful and may have positive effects. What is the right choice ? Are there any other strategies? Personally, I would argue that playing video games for many hours may involve issues such as hard headaches. It is confirmed by the fact that more and more children and teenagers wear glasses nowadays. Concerning some positive effects of these games, I believe they are improbable. It depends on the genre of game which we are playing. Many war games and action ones have been available for years and they are often requested by children rather than adults or teenagers. It would be a problem from the educational point of view. A child who has played this kind of game could have shown an aggressive behaviour with respect to one who has not played it. I think that children have to read books and stay outside with other ones as well. It will be much more beautiful than staying at home. I hope their parents will get the right choice for their sons.

Nowadays our society teaches us to chase wealth, but is it really the key to happiness? Personally, I believe that keeping a good health is more valuable than living in luxury. First of all, unless we are healthy, we cannot make the most of our life and never achieve our full potential. Therefore, we should take better care of the aspects of our health that are in our control such as exercise, food and sleep. But, in order to have a healthy lifestlyle, we do need enough money to cover our basic needs. Although it's stressful when we are worried about little money, a huge amount of it won't make us happier. For example, studies of lottery winners show that after a relatively short period of time, they are no happier than they were before their win. On the other hand, for a healthy body and mind it is essential that we do as much physical activity as possible. But, the rich are supposed to have their luxury houses cleaned and their fancy cars repaired. As a result, they do less exercise than is required. In conclusion, I hold the opinion that the health is the most important treasure in our life.

It's unfortunate that some doctors will only work in hospitals where they earn a lot of money. I think I know the reason why. A lot of young people want to become a dochter. When they have good grades they go to medical school and study for years. The workload during the medical school is heavy. This is the reason why most medical students doesn't have a sidejob. Because of this, students loan money from the government. Because medical school is a long trial it takes years before they can pay back their loan. I think there is a reason how this problem can be solved. During medical school there are internships. Currently, students don't get paid during their internship. If hospitals will pay these young docters, they won't have to loan from the government anymore. This way, when they're doing studying, they don't have to work hard to get their loan paid of.

There are several studies about the influence of the work environment on the employees productivity In most companies there is an open space where employees have their own desks. They can talk to each other, discuss something but also hear each other on the phone. Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages about an open office. The advantages are that employees can see each other. They can see right away if you are available for questions or you're busy. Most of the time, an open office also has a nice ambiance. However, there are some disadvantages. Most of the time it is quite noisy. Different kind of people are talking, to each other and on the phone. It's also not possible to discuss something in private. On the opposite, there are companies who work with cubicles. This can be good for the productivity of the employees. However, most employees experience this as lonely. They like to talk to their colleagues. Talking to colleagues motivates employees. To conclude, I think working in cubicles is productive for a few hours. For the long term I would recommend a more open design.

Almost everyone reminds holiday season as a fun, making new friends and having the time of their lives. I agree with that associations wholeheartedly. When it comes to describe my best holiday ever, one specific trip pops up in my head. It was two years ago. I was 18 and it was one of my first holiday with my friends. We went to a Bulgaria as a group of 6 friends. Three of them was my best buddies, and there was 2 girls yet. We were having a great time there.

University represents a special moment in the life of a student. The carrier and the future job depend on this kind of preparation. At that moment, students can decide to go away for studying or living at home with their parents. These two possibilities have advantages and drawbacks. Firstly, one advantage might be, for example, being very close to the faculty. There will not be necessary to use transports but it is possible to go there by walking or by riding a bike. Moreover, another advantage is to stay with your own without being stressed by old daily issues. Therefore, you might get more relaxed, paying attention on your studies and activities. In addition to it, you can meet new people and make new friends at the university. What a stunning experience! However, there are some drawbacks. For instance, your habits will change drastically: you will have to organize your routine differently, doing housework and cooking for yourself. In this sense, everything you have neglicted up to now. It is time to roll up your sleeves! In spite of these difficulties, university life is an incredible experience.

In this techno-savvy world everything is possible whether it is education on television or entertainment. However, education plays a crucial role in this modern era, and media has a lot of influence in people's lives. From the last two decades, people's way of watching television is changing. They prefer to watch television to acquire the knowledge. First, grabbing a knowledge through television that would be a good way which helps those people who have no time going to school or live in suburban. In order to popularize the education on television, they present more and more programmes about learning. For instance, when I was a child I used to watch more and more television and there were many phonics songs from which I learned many basic things and also good manners. Moreover, television is preferred by every age group. It provides us lot of information. There are many channels such as National Geographic, Discovery channel, through which we get to know about the nature more specifically and can know how to survive in wildlife. There are many cookery shows from which I learn to cook delicious meals at home. I believe television has the potential to educate us, furthermore internet is the excellent way to reach education. We get to control when and what to learn about.

I think all students should have to study music because all the advantages and benefits it brings about. Besides studying music is a great opportunity to develop skills and qualities in students. First of all I want to drive home some of the benefits of learning to play a musical instrument, the first one is the development of the creativity and use of the left hemisphere of the brain of students which as a consequence they can have success on other activities at school. Also, according to an experiment music has so many benefits on the health of the people, it is proved that music makes people feel more relaxed and more aware of their lives as a result they can enjoy those little things in life. Besides it is argued that those people who play an instrument or study music surprisingly have lower levels of stress in their lives as well as they feel happier owing to the release of hormones in the body such as serotonin and dopamine. Apart from that, conforming to some psychologist playing piano, guitar or cello, serves as therapy for children in order to foster the key elements of emotional intelligence which are self-esteem, social skills, motivation, empathy and self-regulation the last one referst to the ability to manage emotions; as a result studying music represents a way of expressing ideas and feelings which contributes to improve the emotional intelligence in students. Furthermore, when students learn to play an instrument and studying music they can communicate with other people no matter from where place they come, because music is a universal language which can unit people. On the other hand, there are so many people who don't have the opportunity to study music or learn to play musical instrument as piano, guitar, violin or ukelele even when they desire it and they dream with it, so if schools can teach them about music and how to play a musical instrument this can be a chance for the students to dedicate their lives to the music and in the future they could likely be excellent and renowed artists. Finally, I would like to say that learning to play a musical instrument and studying music are not only two ways to promote the creativity and art in the students but also the music is a way to share feelings and thoughts, a way to connect with many people from different places from different languages.

Studying abroad has became very popular among students in Europe. Results of the survey conducted by Cambridge University shows that experience of most of the student who went abroad is positive. But, are there really no disadvantages? Fisrtly, I will discuss pros of studying abroad. For sure, students who decide to study in another country are able to exerience living in a different culture. It may open them up to new points of view. Secondly, students who are usually not wealthy can visit new places and not pay huge amount of money for that. They can also make new friendships with people with whom they wouldn't normally meet. But, for some students, it may be very difficult to find in new environment. For example, it would be hard to adapt for Iranian citizen in some of Western Europe big cities. Another thing is that level of education is very different between European countries. So, for some students it is better to stay in their country, where this level is comparably high. To summarize, I believe that studying abroad is beneficial for students. They should apply for going abroad if only they have a chance.

To start with, most of the time it's not a good idea to tell a lie. However, at some moments it's better to live in a lie. In the Netherlands we have a holiday called Sinterklaar. Each year on December 5th, an old man visits the Netherlands. He gives children a gift and sprinkles with treats. However, the old man doesn't really excised. It's parents who rent a man in a customer and buy the presents. Children live in this lie. Anyway, the lie brought joy. It makes people believe in something, something exciting. At holidays like Sinterklaas it's fine to tell a lie. However, in most other scenarios, it isn't okay. For example, it's not okay when young adults lie to their parents where the're going. In addition, it's also not fear too lie to your partner. When people tell a lie, they don't consider the consequences. When people find out the truth, knowing their where lied to will upset them. It isn't a nice feeling knowing someone is lying to you. Take as an example, when your partner is secretly talking to another woman. You often find him on his phone. Ask him about it. Do you want him to tell the truth or do you want to live in a lie and found out later? I think you know the answer. My advice about telling a lie, think about the other his feeling. Would become happy not knowing or is it better to tell them?

I strongly believe that having several teachers is better than having one teacher for several years. In ancient times, a lot of people go to one rector to learn so many subjects. That was good enough for them because there are not many subjects. However there are cons to that because one person could not be expert in all subjects. There are a lot of limitations to that as those people would learn only what their rector knows. Nowadays most of the university have more than one rector to teach and train the students. Student would learn different experiences and knowledge for they have many professors. Some university have even more than one professor for single subject. So that they can concentrate on specific part to be more proficient on that area. Conclusion, student nowadays can be better than their teachers because they could learn different skills from their respective teacher.

I absouletely agree with this decision. Around the world young people are making future and their healthy is one of the most important problems. I noticed healthy of the young people but in my mean it is not just physical healthy but also it contains soul and mental healthy. For that reason I emphasis sport. majority of students at universities are 18-25 . This circle is the most important time of everyone life . Students at universities are teaching but I think studying is one of the part of their responsibilities . They have to improve other abilities becausse in the true life when they will graduated they will enter the real world and probably they have to force with some problemss. So I emphasize of sport because sport is making a person strong and it can decrease her/his streess. When universities are forcing on doing sport it is just for sstudents because the lifestyle of almost of them is inactive . They pass most of their time back of the computers . Their movement and activity is in minimal degree. Unfortunately technology and science have prepared easy life for us but they come down our activities. Some people need to force them to do something . In my opinion sport can act like a inspirig thing and it can reassure students that are some difficulties in their life. Todays metropolises have complexed with huge difficulties that directly effect on the style of life . Modern life does not good in all aspects . It makes warn people about the bad affects of the wavy sea. I think we can see the reflection of sport in facing with hazard positions . Athelites are stronger and anxiouse . At the end I believe that sport for young people is like water for trees.

There are pros and cons if it comes to having the same teacher for a longer time or different teacher. Most of all the most signifficant thing is to find a good teacher with an appropriate approach and effective learnig methods which work in our case. If you find someone like that you should stick to this person because it doesn't happen too often. All of us have the mixture of traits and our personalities mainly differ from each other. This is what in a special way made as feel good or bad when interacting with others. Instructors are those who trigger extreme feelings in learners, they can either attract or repulse.. So when you run into someone who does not posses the qualities which are compatible with your own it can be a disaster. It is not the main factor which can discourage you from the subject but also make you discountent from your life overall. So dealing with a variety of instructors gives you a chance to meet the right person for you. On the other hand, when you have this special person, who helps you thrive and expands your knowledge in a pleasant way and is passionate about the subject, you should not let such a person go. Somebody like that is in a shortage. So as far as I am concerned is advantageous to shift a teach whenever you do not feel totally comfortable as a pupil or if your progress is not visable in a long term.

Music is considered in several ways by people. There are such different considerations about it. Someone believes that music is important in our life and, in addition to this, it has a healthy effect on our body. Some scientific studies stated that music may be a useful strategy and therapy , from the medical point of view. It is helpful in surgeries and over. By the way, just some weeks ago it was made this experiment by a surgeon in a famous American hospital. He played a piano while he was getting on a surgery! What an incredible experience! Probably, this medical approach will be adopted by several hospitals in the world. Music is very often associated to something done in the leisure time. However, there are many schools in which music lessons are taught. In particular, students will learn to play musical instruments and more. In fact, they will study the history of music, its origins and the most relevant musicians of the past. It is very important because, whatever it is known up to now is basically related to these artists. However, there is someone who believes that music and music schools are not such important for our society. In this sense, many schools prefer to not teach music as other subjects as well. Furthermore, music is defined as a simple pastime, useless. In my personal opinion, I believe that music is important and it should be taught in every school. Music is a universal language, which links to each other. The world is 'coloured', cheerful and awesome with it. Otherwise, we would live in a grey and sad world.

Nowadays, most of the population lives in cities, either small or big ones, and due to that, villages and towns are starting to disappear, which leads to several problems such as the lack of medical service. Firstly, it has been asserted that medicine is one of the most elected and better rewarned jobs, and it is important to take into consideration that this career can only be studied in a city, so that is the prime reason why most medical doctors choose to live in a city rather than a town. Furthermore, salaries are a crucial issue to have in mind when talking about that problem, since it is well known that city jobs are way better paid than small-town jobs. Although it is a severe problem, it seems that no solutions are given by goberments or town councils when some of them, could be as simple as raising salaries and offering more advantages to people speciallised in medicine, so they can find convenient moving from a city to a town. Besides, if that problem was more shown and stressed by the goberments or the social media, it would spread more, and more people would know about it, instead of ignoring it like most of them do. In conclusion, the lack of medical service in towns is an important problem to tackle since people in towns need medical assintance as much as cities do, and with a little of concern and solidarity, it could be very easy to solve.

Hi Josh, Thank you for your last letter. How are you? I hope you're well. As you know, last year we couldn't participate in any music event due to the global pandemic. Fortunately, we all were vaccinated in January and everything have been going back to normal. That's why yesterday I decided to go to a Madonna concert. I am a big fan of hers and I always wanted to see her live. The tickets were absurdly expensive, but it was a good value for money- she was brilliant. Unfortunately, during the concert a guy insulted my girlfriend and I had to fight with him. Don't worry, I'm all right. The doctor said that I will be able to leave the hospital in a few weeks time. So, we'll see each other at your's birthday party! See you soon Kenny

Office designs play a huge role in the company culture. The type of layout can dictate your employee's satisfaction level, attitude and organisation. Although open offices are believed to encourage better communication and teamwork, offices with cubicles have their own individual working areas which provide privacy to the employees. I think closed offices are better in workplace rather than open offices. To embark on, usually employees work in the same room, often beside each other, while seated along an enormous desk or on workstations positioned close together. Firstly, Open offices are cost-friendly when it comes to financial aspects, it is without a doubt that an open office layout is much cheaper and practical compared to closed office. For instance, company don't need to buy a lot of furniture. Moreover, an open office keeps people accountable and productive, as there is a motivating force in knowing that anyone can see what you're doing. Open office naysayers argue that with all eyes on you, you are less likely to interact with your colleagues. On the other hand, segmented private offices are the best if you want privacy among your employees. Cabins are better for working productively because it would prevent too much noise. For instance, if you have employees working on tasks that require concentration and quiet space, then private panels are the best option. Furthermore, employees can also personalize their cubicles by hanging family photos or memorabilia that will inspire them to work better. Closed cabin offices are better used for companies with jobs that required quiet working areas such as law firms, accounting agencies, and other businesses in the financial sector. To conclude, I believe the best solution is to create cubicles. Unlike open offices, closed offices help minimise distraction allowing employees to work better and produce quality results.

Although there are many doctors who serve in rural areas, most doctors prefer working in cities for some reasons. I will explore there of them which deserves some comments here and make some suggestions. First and foremost, doctors choices concering working places depend on certain criteria such as financial and social ones. Thus, to select where to work is a normal process for not only for doctors but also for other professionals. Needless to say that, everybody has a right to make a choice in order to have a better life. Secondly, basen on the recent statistics, almost all people would rather to have jobs at which they can make good money. For instance, I was introduced to a girl who had not earned well. And then, she decided to change her life and jumped to another well-paid job. Now she smiles and enjoys life much more than the past. Money is not everything but something which is important. Thirdly, job vacancies at medical services in rural areas should be controlled by government. That's to say, national authorities cannot disregard the situations abiut health services there. Being healthy has a vital importance. In a nutshell, providing that the problem of unfound doctors in rural areas can be solved by authorities, citizens who fall in there have an opportunity to go doctors when in need.

Everything wakes and starts to grow - the nature turns green again. Everything is fresh and new. I think the weather is perfect and it is special to me because it is a great change after the cold winter and the hot summer. It is the perfect time for long walks in the forest.

Banning the use of mobile phones is a good idea but is not a good idea in every place. The council is thinking about three places, but each of them must be considered separately. The most important to use to mobile phone is in times of need, so banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants it cannot be a comprehensive law; because sometimes we need to use to mobile phone, sometime people call us that we must answer to them and sometimes, vies versa, we must call to other people. Therefore, this banning is not a good idea, it can be changed in such a way that, there is a limited time the use of mobile phones in these places. The ban e. g. could be for one minute, not more. But this time may vary from place to place. On public transport because people are crowded together, so the ban could be for one minute. In shops the ban may be less than 3 minutes and in restaurants the ban may be less than 5 minutes. . Of course, have to ask the opinion of those who are responsible in these cases.

Personally I think the best choice for students is to move away and live on their own meantime they are attending university because this has so many benefits and a student can learn about the life even more. First of all I think this is a better option because the advantages it brings with it, so I drive home saying that one advantage of living on their own is that they have the chance to not only be more independent but also develop their manage time and organization skills, because they have to be in charge of the payments of the rent, do their laundry, buy pantry, save time for prepare their food and do all other stuff at the same time they do well in the university. Apart from that, some students can live in a house, residency or apartment with other students so they can make good friends and foster their social skills, owing to living with other people there would be good and not really great moments which implies that it is necessary respect, learn how to solve conflicts, how to express differences but without damaging someone. Moreover, students can go through different experiences which will help them to grow personally, such as they would be more responsible and matured due to there are also challenges of living alone, such as first days they probably are going to run out of milk or paper and nobody is going to buy them while they are studying, so they have to be more organized, have schedules and take decisions every day prioritizing things over others. On the other hand, moving away from home sometimes is the best decision owing to many students live away from the university which means they have to commute long distances in order to arrive on time to class, which can be tiredsome after certain period of time, so bearing this in mind living near the university can be perfect for this students and represents an opportunity to have more time to their subjects. Nonetheless, this choice can bring out the best of the students it also can bring out the worst of them, because living in your own requires effort and compromise to take care of yourself and accomplish your goals. To sum up, living on your own has benefits, learning and challenges but it is a great experience and means a chance to prepare yourself for the near future. Finally, I would say that I support this decision but everyone has the right to decide and evaluate which is the best option for her.

It depends. If you study a foreign languages, you should travel to a country where you can practise this language. For example, you may travel to Ireland to improve your English level.

However, this way to practise suppose you must go out from your house. You need to find an exchange house. You don't know nothing about this family and you may be staying in there so bad.

The atmosphere is so comfortable as there isn't much carbon emission and the temperature is approximately 20 censius degree.

Like others, I have my favorite seasons and they are spring and fall. If I had to choose one, I would pick fall season. This season always amazes me every year and I had good experiences in it. First of all, fall's weather is unique and differs from any other season. As it comes after the hot summer, the temperature starts dropping and it becomes enjoyable to go outdoor during the day without worrying about protection from the sun. Also, during fall, all trees change their color to beautiful shades of red, and they fall one the sidewalks and streets creating a distinctive look that always comes to my mind when thinking of this season. In fact, it is a great opportunity to go for a hike and explore nature at that time of the year. Another thing that makes fall my favorite period is that I can meet my friends and family after being away for a while. In the summer, people usually travel to different locations. However, they come back in the beginning of fall to start their new semester which is a great opportunity to get together know about what they done in their travels.

University students are considered to be adults. They can be in charge of their own lives nearly like adults, however, their main goal is a full-time study, not yet a full-time job. Choosing places to live during their studies is one of a crucial decision for them to make. For students who choose to stay at home. One of the reasons can be finances. Stay at home can save a lot of money on accommodation, food, bills etc. Moreover, it can also guarantee the safety of students and put their parents' worry at ease when they know that their children are in the safe place and in their most comfort. On the other hand, students who choose to stay on their own during their studies at the university, can be more confident and be able to handle any obstacles that might be thrown at them during this time, money shortage, juggling study and part-time job, take care of their own basic needs such as food and clean clothes, to mame a few. In conclusion, stay on my own while study at the university is the choice I would prefer. Because being on your own can teach you to be strong, ready for good and bad situation in the future once you enter a work cycle.

Luckily I was free on Saturday evening, and his brother was also going to gig, so I won't be alone and decided to attend the concert. While entering, I was totally amazed by the sound of crowd, and I came to know that there is an up-and-coming singer and guitarist performing; I was blown away by how good he was. The band was known by the name Black Mamba, one of role models for many Indians. The concert started at 7 p.m, but there was support act first , so I had planned to arrive a little later as I wasn't interested in that. I was able to listen to the latest songs which weren't released yet in the market and, we danced the whole on the beats. I hope to see you soon. Rahul

Many young people believe that migrating for studies in universities may benefit them while some of them like to be with their family for support and help in education. In my opinion, families are the supporting pillar for every student to achieve their goals and offer them a good environment to be successful in their life. To embark on, adolescents nowadays prefer to go far from their home because they think that it could lead them to the better carrier. They choose this way because they want to become independent and gain some experience facing difficulties throughout the process. However, they can suffer from the homesickness. Furthermore, being away from family might results in to be follow sexual or porno site which destroy their life at the beginning. For instance, some students who do not have family to keep eye on them they have no fear of doing dreadful things. Their friends mislead them to do some crime for their own benefits such as consuming drugs, or theft for the greed of luxurious things. On the other hand, students who prefer to live with their family because they feel relax that their family is here with them whenever they need their support whether it is financial or psychological. Family also protects their children to stay away from mislead. They not only provide educational support but also taught them good manners and how to interact with people, help others, being aware from awful activities to be successful in life. Although being alone throughout studies can make students mature enough to face life trouble, being with family feels them that no one will help them in crises or risks, To sum up, stay away from the family provides the happiness of being independent; however stay with family gives a great pleasure to be relax and follow family advise to deal with any problems.

I agree with this type of requirement that students must complete some volunteer work in order to graduate. I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, students get a chance to communicate with many people by volunteer work whom they have less opportunity to. By cleaning work, they can communicate with local people and by devoting work, they can communicate with weak people. This is beneficial for students because they can understand many perspectives as well as broaden. Secondly, students get a chance to improve their action by volunteer work. It needs spontaneity. Students have to be active for others by themselves. This is beneficial for students because action is necessary to promote in the future. Lastly, students get a chance to improve their self-confidence by volunteer work as they are appreciated. This is beneficial for students because self-confidence leads their actions. In conclusion, I agree with the requirement that students must complete some volunteer work in order to graduate with those three reasons.

This article will discuss both sides and I will sketch my personal opinion.

To keep students occupied by useful activities is usually a great challenge for teachers. In the past, reading a book or doing some ordinary activities were enough for enjoying children but now it's very difficult to satisfy them. Studying music became, through the years, a relevant and innovative activity that leading students to increase their skills and capacities. in some rare case, some "ignorant" schools don’t allow children to follow a musical learning session. It is, in my modest opinion, a huge mistake considering the importance of music. Playing music provides students many faculties that they need like open mind, connection with other friends or self-esteem feeling. Many schools aren’t consciousness about the importance of music in enhancing the student’s behavior and therefore giving them a solid protection against violence or drugs. I continue to believe strongly that music is very important for students not only in schools but also in life.

I think all students should study music and learn to play musical instrument. I have three reasons to support my opinions. Firstly, we have a sense of hearing, which is one of our five senses. Why don't we improve this potential skill? Listening to many music, we can improve it easily and understand this world more. Secondly, we can broaden our world with touching musical instrument at school. It is difficult to touch or play many kinds of them at our daily life because of fewer opportunities. But there are many and we play them for free! Why don't we take the precious chance to touch musical instruments? We may start our career as professional musicians with the opportunities. Thirdly, this world is full of music. Music is everywhere. There are many seasonal music or event realted music and so on. Even if little we know about music, we can more enjoy our life. With these three reasons, I agree that students should study music and musical instruments.

Although It is being possible at this moment, it is so expensive. I'm sure that my son's will watch the first trip to the moon before they will die. Today, people are buying electric cars. In 2050 the cars will be able to fly without wheels. Planes will fly faster than planes are flying today. In my opinion, transport will be faster and less pollution.

On the one hand, they think that they are getting used to the technology, for example, when you visit these people you will find many machines such as heating appliances for eating, clothes and dishes. In addition, do not forget the garden equipment and massages. On the other hand, some societies disagree on this point. To clarify this, people in South Africa and America prefer to work in agriculture or education, without using any technical means. Because these people believe that God created people to work by themselves. In conclusion, after carefully analyzing both points of view, I believe that we must constantly read books in order to progress.

Volunteer work is really important, from the social point of view. Considering how many poor people are in the world, we cannot neglict the contribution given by volunteers. The biggest cities of the world (and not only) host several volunteer organizations and no-profit associations. Basically, the goal of these associations consists of providing food, a bed and whatever it is necessary. We have to be proud of them. Some high schools have a requirement: students will succeed in graduating only if they complete a certain amount of volunteer work. That is a good choice, by means of students are prepared to face the world and every kind of situation. Doing these social experiences, students are able to insert themselves in difficult social contexts and help unlucky people at the same time. Furthermore, volunteer work is just not this: there are several possible activities, which could be more or less suitable for each student. It depends on them, they have to choose carefully and cleverly. That is not a joke! In light of these considerations, I would conclude by stating that organizations and activities like these must be sustained and preserved. We have to start focusing a bit more on the others than on ourselves.

I am part of who believe the quote saying: “If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.” Even if we live in a stressful and difficult life, I still thnking that telling the telling truth is the only way that can lead to reach a peaceful life. Our social environment is infected unhapilly by this disease that called "lies." Whereever you go, you meet a person who use the lies every time they speak without feeling wrong. I think this bad behavior is the unvoidable result of lack of education within families or in school. When you have parents lying continuously that lead their children to follow them in this behavior. Parents and teachers have the reponsability to educate chidrens not only by giving the good ewample but also by explaining how much lying is dangerous for our community. Our children are living currently in one difficult environment where the lies are the common behavior so it's hard for them to adopt a good way for their life. We should share with teenagers and young generation the benefits of telling truth and leading him to increase their values and believes. Our laws also have to set a new rules that punishing who use the lies in their behavior. in addition, TV news program could also communicate a spot about this issue.

Currently, there are many people prefer to use computers and tablets to study. Thick and heavy books no longer used by the students to study. Why students choose to use computers and tablets to study instead of books? This is in light of the fact that many students think that using computers or tablets to study is more convenient than reading books. From my view point , I think it is necessary to replace books with computers and tablets in schools and universities. This is because as a students, I think that bringing books to schools and universities are very inconvenient. Books are very thick and heavy. A newspaper article alleged that many students suffer from backpain and backbone deformation because they ought to carry heavy and thick books to schools or universities every day. Thus, sooner or later they will suffer from these injuries. On the other hand, bringing a computer or a tablet to school is much more convenient and students do not need to bring a lot of school bags to school. They just need to bring one backpack to keep the computer or tablets. This is the fact that all of the documents have store in the computer or tablets. As we all know that, a computer or a tablet will not be heavier than a stack of books. Besides, one of my reasons to agree that computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities is that when students need to search for some information, they do not need to flip through by pages. With a click of a finger, students are able to look up the information by using computers or tablets. Consequently, students are able to save some precious time and can reduce their strenuous study sechedules because they have more free time. From my perspective, I truly think that using computers or tablets brings us a lot of perks and benefits. Furthermore, as a students, I think that students should get used to use computers or tablets when they are still in their teenage years, so that they know how to use computers when they are working in their adulthood. This is because currently most of the works are using computers or tablets instead of using a book. In addition, I also think that computers and tablets should replace books in schools and universities because we are able to save more trees as papers are made by the trunk of a tree.

Everybody should travel at least one time in their own life. Most people have already done it or not yet. Concerning my own experience, I am going to spend some lines about my best holiday ever. Two years ago, my friends and I booked a holiday, which would have lasted a week, three days in Praha and the other three ones in Budapest, Hungary. I admit we were so excited. Nothing went wrong, so we took off to Praha on 10th of August. After that, we went to the hostel, in order to leave luggage and start our adventure! Although we had few days, we lived them as we could do by visiting many typical places of this fascinating city. We went to the Old Castle, we went into the historical centre , buying some souvenirs and taking many photos as memories. Then, we had lunch in a typical restaurant, where we could have tasted traditional plates and drunk a lot of beer! However, the best would have still not come. This was when we went to the spa. What a beautiful day! Thanks to my friends, it was the best holiday ever. I will not forget it.

I don't agree with the first opinion. I think teachers should change each year. There is a lot of factor in this situation. Firstly, students need a different teacher's opinion and view. For this reason, I think it very important to improve children. If they see different kinds of opinions from their teacher, they can develop their thinking system and another brain system. If they have the only same teacher for several years, it will never happen. Secondly, ıf students have the same teacher for several years, they can establish an emotional connection. This is a significant and dangerous part in my opinion. I think this connection should never exist between teachers and students because this type of emotional connection can be dangerous for teachers and students. Some teachers have different kind of experiments level, this is another significant point. Other teachers may be more experienced than some teachers. Consequently, teachers should change each year.

I believe in all around personality development of students for that students should be engaged in extracuricular activity along with volounter work. I feel this way for two reasons which I wish to explore in this writeup. Every students have to go in society for that he has to be ready for social liabilities like family responsibilities and job liabilities. Day by day envoinment is getting harder to surview and comptetion is growing in every field hence students should be ready for all dynamics. Many universities are encoureging students for volunteer work by different courses like NCC and NSS which groom the personality of student at every aspect like physcal, mental, spritual and social parameteres. Moral values is dececying in societis hence people are not interested to do work for that they don't get salary. In the wake of this scenario offering the course for requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate, it would be beneficial not only students but also societies to maintaning the moral values of people.

I agree with the opinion that learning to speak a foreign language is important these days. I have three opinions to support the idea. First of all, speaking a foreign language expands the world we can join. Our work is not completed domestically these days. In particular, the population in Japan has been decreasing for several years. At the same time, more foreign people who want to get jobs in Japan are coming to Japan. Japanese people have to work with foreign people recently. Also, it is severe to sell Japanese products only in Japan under the situation. Thus, Japanese companies should sell their products globally. If they can only treat the Japanese language, they will lose the opportunities to get their products to be known in foreign countries. People in other countries are in the same situation. Therefore, an easy way to expand people's world is to enable them to speak multiple languages, which can increase their work efficiency. Secondly, we can earn a lot of money if we can speak more than one language. In Japan, English speakers can get a job paid a lot of money, and have a rich life. Many Japanese don't have a skill in speaking English. The CEFR level for English speaking for most Japanese is B1 or lower. If Japanese who has more than a B2 or a higher speaking level, he can get a chance to work with people in foreign countries, and he can get a higher wage. In other countries, people who can speak a foreign language are elite and able to obtain much salary. Thirdly, learning to speak a foreign language may help the reading of a foreign document, and the skill let us make a lot of time. From the technological side, most reports are written in English. Thus, we should read these foreign documents to interpret what is described. If we can read English smoothly, we will earn any time, and we can conduct any other things. If we are in a situation where we are dealing only with our mother tongue, we can only get limited information. Learning a foreign language is effective for us to make a lot of time for conducting many jobs. To sum up, speaking a foreign language such as English can expand our job capacities.

It goes without saying that living on your own is one of the most crucial decisions a person has to make in their life. Moving away while studying is increasingly claimed to be the correct decision. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would like to point out some of the advantages living on your own while studying has. No doubt, once you are at college, your life changes dramatically. Ever since then, you are not a teenager any longer and you are capable of making some important choices that have significant effects on your future. One of them could be to choose to live by yourself. To do so, it is undoubtedly needed to find a job which provided you with the economic resources necessary to afford your expenses, even if it is a part-time job. By undertaking a job, not only will you understand how hard life can be, but also you take some crucial responsibilities such as working in team or dealing with people. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned. Living by yourself means that you are the one who is responsible for the shores at home. As a result of working and taking care of the shores, you do not get round to studying as much time as you wish, and that could be negative for you in the way that your academic results can be worse than you expected them to be. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that had it not been for those drawbacks, living on your own while studying would be the perfect moment in your life for you to find out who you are, who you want to be, and where you belong to.

In my opinion university student should leave away the family and leave in hostel. it would be better for his personality development . I feel this way for two reasons which I wish to explore in this essay . Firstly I would like to say that personality grroming is very important at this age . As we know if students live in his familiy he could not get such exposure which is needed for after entering in family life and professional life. just after completing his university life ones entered in professional and family life which is not easy and for that you need to prior expouser and and in my point that university independent life teach it well. secondly , I would like to discuss economic point of view that in higher education system books are much costly and student has to read many point as self study and for that its must he have all books but if you are living in group you can share the books and study materials which are not avaliablre in the library. further to this , as we know discussion and group study is essential for better understanding of subjects.

Have you ever asked yourself: Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? From my personal standpoint, learning to speak a foreign language is still important, maybe even more. Why is that? Knowing foreign languages help you in everything such as Travelling, communication, etc. You can easily find the places, ask for directions, and even order food. Speaking a language gives you a better understanding of the country's culture.

The more languages you know, the better life you have.

Our life constanly changes over time and the future of travel will also proceed to a new level. But I don't think everything will be altered at all. I'm going to give you some demonstrations. Firstly, much more modern it surely is, improved technology will give us a faster approach to take a travel around the world. I believe that in the future, people don't need any travel agencies, they can do it themselves. Do you think that is the limit? I know it isn't. Most of us know that we as human are capable of travelling outer space, even that's just a glimmer of hopeness. We can get to a broader range of our capacity in the possible travel. The imagining is the crucial and the time will prove it. As I mentioned in the out set, something will be changed but something still remains. They are the proffessional travellers. They are superior and really useful. I don't think people want them to be disappeared. We all use social media to research the travel sites where we never been to. We still need people as the mentors who have practicial experiences to give us suggestions.

Dear town council, I realise that there are a proposal of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. As a part of the town, I think it's important to share my opinion. I think this is not a good idea. First of all, this will hinder the town's prolonged effort to attract tourists. This is because tourists form other towns will find this idea bothering and will leave a bad impression on our town. Other that that, this will bring inconvenience to us who utilise the short period of time on public transport and in shops and restaurants to do important things like reading the newspaper or hearing a podcast. The amount of time wasted in a long run is huge. Some of us will also have important calls that need to be dialled immediately. I conceive that this proposal is brought to consideration due to the increasing number of accident due to phone usage on public transport and long queue in restaurants and shops. For that I would like to suggest a small immature suggestions that is to have a campaign to educate the residents to stop using phone excessively in not suitable places or time. I hope that the town council will put in serious thoughts on this matter. The advice that I shared are of my own opinion and I hope that it will contribute in this matter.

Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. People often get their trust by telling the truth to others. Telling the truth makes everyone believes in you and more people would like to be friends with you. As the saying goes, 'honesty is the best policy', people often believe that people who tell the truth have a good personality. However, there are sometimes we are unable to tell the truth because sometimes telling the truth to someone might hurt their feelings, making them feel sad or might make them feel uncomfortable. Thus, as for me I think it is acceptable to tell a lie sometimes. From my perspective, I think that tell a white lie maybe will make people feel better or less worried. For example, most of the parents often tell white lies to their beloved children so that their children will not worried about them. Every parents in the universe do not want their children worried about them, they hope their children can live happily. On the other hand, there are also some people who really love and care about their parents. They will tell a white lie to their parents, telling their parents that they are living happily and no need to worry about them but in the reality they are actually not happy about everything in their life or they are unable to get what they want such as their jobs, their studies and their life. They just hope that their parents are happy and feel relieved that their children are doing well. Hence, I think sometimes it is acceptable to tell a lie. Furthermore, sometimes telling the truth to someone might make you lose your friends and might cause some quarrels. For instance, one of your friends tries to look pretty today so she wears a heavy makeup which does not look good to her then you tell the truth to her and say that she is very ugly today. As a results, she will feel really upset and frustrated with you. Instead, you should tell her that she looks good with the makeup and then you can give her some suggestions about the makeup. Consequently, you will not only won't lose a friend, your friend will also appreciate with your help. Thus, once again I feel that telling a lie is acceptable sometimes.

I'm looking forward to going abroad for a master's degree. I think there are a lot of advantages to studying abroad. Firstly, some foreign universities can provide better education conditions for the student. Particularly, Europe, the USA, and Canada's universities. I always thinking about going to Canada for masters. But firstly, I need to improve my English very well. Another advantage is, their people and conditions are different from my country. They have good living conditions and happiness. Who doesn't want to go to Canada? In addition, if you live in Turkey. Canada has a lot of national parks. You can visit whenever you want. Definitely, there are disadvantages of studying abroad. I think one of the hardest is adaptation. Because you come from a different country and culture. If you want to live there, you must adapt them. You should learn about their culture and lifestyle. It can take time but you will use to their lifestyle. Then, you will miss your family too much surely. That's another difficult disadvantage. However, thanks to technologies it is easier at this time. Because you can video call them and see them every day. As a result, there are advantages and disadvantages but if you live in Turkey, advantages heavier than disadvantages.

For example, several games are educational, but other games are so much violent. So If you play a video game, but the game that you play is educational, I don't see any problem, but if you play some games that show our sons violence, they show us violent behaviour.

Secondly, foods are another most important thing for our body. If we want to stay healthy, we should be careful about what we eat. We shouldn't eat too many hamburgers, chips, and other unhealthy food. Our body needs healthy oils, a sufficient amount of vitamins, and minerals.

They will have longer and powerful. They will pass through the cities. Trains are too loud our times. In the future, they will be noiseless. What about cars? Everyone dreams of flying cars. In my opinion, it's not realistic. Cars won't flying but will be smarter and powerful. We won't need a driver in the future because cars will drive themselves. Cars accidents percentage will reduce, literally. People won't die because of car accidents. As a result, future travel seems attractive, safe, and fast.

Nowadays, television is universally known as one of the most needed things in human's life. What is the importance of having a television in our own house? Is television is that important to us? If one day television vanished in our life, are we able to 'survive'? Thus, let us take a look the importance of television that brings us. First and foremost, television not only entertains us, it is also able to educate all ages of people from the young ones to the old ones. Television creates a window upon the world for us to understand and explore more about the four corners of the world. For example, we can acknowledge the things that happens around us swiftly by watching television. We didn't even need to travel around to get the latest news, we just need to sit on the couch and switch on the television to watch the latest news. Isn't it sound so simple and convenient. From that, we are able to get educated from the news that are reported in the television. Do you know why? This is because there are a lot of people shared their experience through the television and we are able to learn some new stuffs from their experience and avoid the same mistakes that they have done. As the saying goes, 'prevention is better than cure'. We can prevent ourselves to do the same mistakes that others had made. Thus, we are able to reduce the troublesome and burdens in our life. Besides, we are able to learn other languages by watching television. For example, there are a lot of people would like to learn Korean language so they watch Korean dramas from the television. I think this is a quite useful way to learn other languages and be educated. Apart from that, I have seen many parents allow their children to watch English movies fromm the television. This is because children are able to develop their English language skills from young age. From my one of my experiences, my niece is able to speak fluent English at the age of five, I am astonished by her. After asking her mother, I knew that my niece actually started to watch English movies from the television at the age of three. Henceforth, this is one of the evidence that television are able to educate children. In addition, children can also learn some moral values from the movies. This can help to nurture a good behavior in the children. Currently, parents often allow their kids to watch documentary films from the television. This is the light of the fact that to help them develop a vast cauldron of knowledge and they are able to know more about the world. Hence, I agree that television actually are able to educate us.

I'm in the process of creating a blog in English language to satisfy my passion for writing. After taking a look on Write and Improve, I jumped up the chance to train and get my English writing to a new level. I was a bit confused at the beginning when I realised that instead of providing me with any basic guidelines for how to write a correct sentense or perfect pharagraph, I had to cope with some lists of tasks which allow me to choose an appropriate level to start with. Well, I think this is the place you can totally improve your English yourself by writing and writing again. Our mission is to keep exercising every single day, and they will check your spellings, show the incorrect words and track your progress. It sounds great, right? No matter how I discuss in each task they require, they don't score my presentation based on persuadable sentences, so I'm free to let things out from my comprehension. There are something in first step which just wanted to stop your try, and you need to fight with it. When I had finished about six tasks, they frustrated me of the result on the board showed my levels going down, it made me feel that the more I wrote, the more disappointments I got. Bearing in mind this must've been first challenge, I put it back to my mind and headed fowards to other tasks. And step by step, I could finally appreciate my effort when I figure out my English writing has been going so farther than I had expected - less incorrect spellings, less shilly sentences and in less time. The program will help improve your English writing skill just like it's done for me. But don't forget that you should need a lot of patience which helps you go faster.

I can agree with an opinion that telling always the truth is important to some extent. In general being honest and reliable person is very important and nowadays it can be a rare. That's why these people are mostly very appreciated by others. In my opinion when you are such a person you are probably vise and intelligent. Therefore you know that there are situations where telling a lie is almost necessary. I have on mind moments when telling a lie do not hurt second person. Moreover he or she might be thankful after he figure out that you did that. Sometimes you need to tell a lie to avoid bothering another person. It can happen when you or somebody else is sick very seriously. When the person whom you told a lie can not do anything maybe for him/her it would be better because he/she does not change anything and only he/she would be furious or get mad. There is something like a lie with a good intention. In my opinion telling a lie is in general bad idea but there are many exceptions when doing that is not bad and even though that person after time find out about this he forgive you without a doubt. A lie is a bad thing when you use it as a way to achieve something.

If I had to pick up one kind of teacher, I would say that both teachers are definitely needed to good quality to the student education. A teacher doing lessons for the same students for several years could create a stronger relationship among students and among the students with him and deeper knowledge in specific topis. In biology, for example, the learning process is recommended to be guided by just one professor. Importantly, the teacher must be a good one. Other classes would be better if they are taught by different proffesors such as art and politics topics because the students can understand and learn with more diversity of point of views. To compare art with biology, the heart is to keep the blood flowing is an opinion shared by any biologist, instead the origen of a political problem could change from one professor to another in a huge extension depending on who is teaching it. These are my reasons to respond that mixing both professor is the better option.

Having the same teacher offers a lot advantages. The same person can pursue you, your development and results over a longer period of time. The releationship between should be better and the teacher can evaluate the students even better. On the other hand if the relationship is badly affected, then it's difficult to repair. You can't change easily the opinion of somebody. The conclusion is that the teacher may not want to help you because of a bad experience. The second proposal was to having a new teacher each year. I like this idea because it's not common and I have heard the first time of it. It would also give a lot of chances. As a student you will meet a few teacher during your schooldays. Some will stimulate you more and some maybe less. You have experienced more teacher skills and approaches. In the end you have a wide range and you can choose would you like most. I am always for changes and I would decide for changing the teacher each ear. To gain more experience with this approach. Someday you will be able to assess both approaches.

Let us start by identifying: volunteer work is done by people who accept to do something themselves without any requirement. Just by reading the word 'volunteer' meaning, we figure out that some schools might forget or ignore the consistency of what they require their students to do. Obviously volunteer work benefits many things and people, it's so respectful if you are a part of, but it's acceptable if you feel like refusing, that's all your choice. One thing so important, you are not supposed to give anyone helps, if you do, that's just kind of you. There is not even just a minimum mistake here, you'll simple not be able to receive a 'thank-you' word. There is a thing called Esthic, which is defined by people for the right behave to others. Volunteer is out of the box filled with that right behave or the negative, it should be put on a wholly different box with the label written 'good to be done' attached. I never mean to encourage people not to go for volunteer work, but mean it's fine if people have no interest, that's their choices, don't judge them at all. I know that we always need people who work as volunteers in every field, this is the essential work for our lives. Nevertheness, we don't have to spend too much time on it and without lots attemps. Go back to the debate about some schools require students to do a certain volunteer work in order to graduate. Why don't they just find out some effective methods for this problem. For me, instead of giving requirement to students, they could encourage them to do it. The more work they do, the more privilege they would have to go on the path to graduation. I think this will work well. Again, never requirement!

Hello everyone, I thank you for your question. I think the animals belongs to nature. Especially for the forest, because they are creations and they have feelings like every human being. The fact is, that some people like giving their opinions without any idea about the issue. An example of it is that, some people think, the animals are a good learn subject! I'll try to explain some things with an example. When the student wants to learn, he goes to school, to the teacher, to the university and to the library. The teacher and the university won't be braught to the student. The same thing should happen, when people will learn about animals. The animals should be visited by people in case to be able to behave themseves naturally. If you bring a bird in to a cage to crate him, you won't learn about him, but rather you want peresecute him, because you cannot force some animals to learn about them. Finally, I hope that people will feel one time, that the animals have feelings like people may be more than people. Thank you. Ahmad.

It is said that 80 percent of a language consists of vocabulary and only 20 percent of grammar, which is often overlooked, although it is equally important. Teaching supports like in face-to-face lessons help to clarify questions, and furthermore push students above their limit because teachers can give some personalised advice. Learning a language mainly based on online lessons requires a high level of self-discipline and self-motivation. In terms of flexibility, it may be an advantage as time differences or suffering from illnesses do not matter. Nevertheless, the easiest way to internalise a foreign language is to be surrounded by it, hence a stay abroad is highly recommended to boost the progress of learning. This can become a once-in-a-lifetime experience that students always like to reminisce. To sum it up, difficulties may arise no matter which method you choose, but drive and determination coupled with patience and perseverance will lead to success. Keeping this in mind, do not expect yourself to run before you can walk.

Have you ever had a friend who is able to play at least one kind of musical instruments? Yes, you might have. Do you think that they have capacity of doing some certain things faster and better than other people? It sounds so obviously that I totally agree that students should study music, it not only benefits their studying, but also works for some certain situations in their daily lives. When we start to know more about music, it should be a little hard for some one, but when you keep playing with them, you will longer feel like doing homework, but like making friends. You might not use music as your life-long job, but you should learn it as the right support: Firstly, it's helpful for your concentration. When you're studying to read a song or trying to remember chords to play a song by the guitar, you're required to completely focus on it, because you won't want to break up beautiful pieces of music into chaotic sections. Yes, you need to learn how to be a whole part of the song you're playing or creating. Next, I don't think you would say that you have never been stressed out for your job, even you really love the job. You surely can listen to your favourite music to make a balance between work and living life, but if you can play a song for yourself instead, it even work better. Is it wong when I've just said it a right support for the path of your career? Do you agree that working or studying with a good memory is a fascinating thing you must be interested in? You will start with each music note complex melody of some hard songs, and consequenly, it becomes a part of your life which you can use for work with the aim to make things more convenient. That sounds great, doesn't it? Are you interested in joining a music class today?

Nowadays, most people share the view that music is not a trustworthy choice when deciding a professional career, in spite of that, music lessons should not be forgotten or ignored, as music provides a great number of benefits to people of any age. Firstly, it is undeniable that music may seem to be not as relevant as other subjects at school that could be maths, history or biology, for example; however, some research about music and learning how to play an instrument easy to handle, have asserted that it can help children to improve their bodily skills, memory, social habits... Secondly, the amount of music lessons students have is an important point to consider since, given the irrefutable advantages of music, it is also true that music must not be a prime subject. Therefore, it would be reasonable for students to enjoy from 1 to 3 music lectures per week. Last but not least, the obligation of studying that subject should be mentioned too, because music should not be a mandatory subject in every school year, instead, students may study it mandatorily only one course so they have more general knowledge, and from then onwards, it is advised to give them the opportunity to choose if they want to continue their music studies or no. In conclusion, from my point of view, everybody should be enabled to know their study preferences in order to choose what subject pleases them more, and music, should not be excluded from that list.

Today's generation is inclined towards the routine of indolent which is hazardous for health. Being involved in sports might help students to be physically fit and active in any kind of performance whether it is taking part in competitions or studies. Educational institutes are concerned about the physical fitness of students for the betterment and healthy lifestyle. I totally agree with the statement that schools must inculcate sports activities for young people. To commence with, it is true that sports help the young generation to build strength to participate in various activities. It also leads them towards a healthy routine which curbed the sedentary behavior in any field. Moreover, it can be seen that people who involve in sports or do regular exercise are more active than those who only sit and enjoy food or stick to their phone. In addition, sports activities also build self-confidence in students which helps them in achieving their goals. On the other hand, today's generation is clinging to technology or mobile phones due to which they got possessive to their gadgets. Most of the study material is available on mobile phones. However, it restricts them from outdoor activities. Furthermore, this sedentary behavior leads them towards the health issues such as obesity, anxiety, mental depression. As a result, adults get addicted to the consumption of alcohol, smoking or, other substance. Thus, to deal with these situations and to make the youth more active parents should encourage their children to take part in sports from an early age. And school plays a vital role to promote these activities because it is the place from where we adapt the habits. Having considered all the above points, I totally agree that educational institutes should impose exercise classes or sports events to evasion of unhealthy diets and the sedentary lifestyle. It is difficult for most of the children to adopt these habits; nevertheless, it is not impossible to obtain in our daily routine.

Personally I see that books shoulds be replaced by technological devices in many fields especially for educational purposes. First, technology provides us with easier access to information with no limits. Indeed, search engines allow students to look for explanations, research and studies. Besides, schools and universities are using smart devices to facilitate teaching and education. Studies prove that teaching lessons with tablets and computers is more efficient than it is using books. Added to that, despite the fact that books are the roots of t Internet, I believe that the web gives pupils the chance to discover the wide world of lessons by learning new stuff in a shorter period than by using books and papers. Eventually I think that computer and tablets simplify education more than books do and therefore they should be replaced by technoligcal devices in schools and universities.

I think learning to speak a new language is definitely important, but not as important as it was in the past, because now we got things like Google translate, so it is not necessary if you want to communicate with other people, whearas people from the time before there were phones and internet had to learn a language or get a translator in order to communicate with people speaking different languages. On the other hand: learning a new language may help you with understanding your own language better, especially how languages work and where words come from.

For me it's quite easy to take a clear stand on this matter. In my opinion as much teachers you have as better. Why? Because from each of them you can take something. If you have ability to understanding people and to distinguish what is good or wrong it will be simple to taka an advantage from their knowledge and experience. For many people having the same teacher for several years is better. I think it is that because they do not like leave their comfort zone. Most people get used to one teacher and they do not want to any change becasue this is a convenient situation for them. In my opinion an education time is too short in most countries. That's why kids and teenagers should have more varied way of gathering knowledge. How to do it? I believe the simplest way to do this is to let them to have a contact with as much as it is possible numbers of teachers. Thanks to that they will be able to see many ways of looking at different topics and particular knowledge.

Some college students go away and stay on their own, whilst others prefer to stay with their family members in a shared house. In my opinion, it's better to stay with the family because they can provide the unconditional support during critical situations , and help their children to concentrate on their studies. Even though it is true that students learn a lot by living on their own, I think it is good to live in the family house. One reason for this is that they provide all kinds of support whenever required without expecting anything in return. This means that they won't be under pressure to do any sort of household work and as a result, they won't get depressed. To illustarte this, recent research by leadin psycholigists in the USA has shown that the students, who spend their childhood with their parents by living in the same house, never feel demotivated. Another reason why I believe that it is important to stay with parents is that kids need to focus and concentrate on their studies. Parents home is the best place for this because they get all the resources and additionally, elderly people can share their experience which would lead pupils to understand the subject better. For example, according to extensive research,pupils aged between 10 and 20 who stay with elders do far better in exams than those who stay on their own. In conlcusion, although it may be hard to live with parents, I think they provide the best support which cannot be given by anyone else. Also students can get help from elders in studies in order to achieve good marks.

In my opinion, schools will be different in the future. Technology is highly developed in this century, and it continues to improve itself. The schools will improve themselves with this technology. Students will use better technological tools for their education, and these tools will help them compared to old tools. Technology will provide better conditions for students. They will learn better, and they will have the ability better than us. They might not go to school in the future. They might have home their education on the computer. On the other hand, these developments will have provided some worse conditions. If they have their education at home, they wouldn't have met their friends and teachers.

Personally, I believe that zoos is the safest place to learn many things about animals. There are several reasons why most people believe that: easy to arrive , sefty and communcate with animals. The first reason why people think zoos is a good place to learning about animals is that easy to go them . For instance, there are many zoos in many cities and countries around the worl; thus, it is easy to visit any one to see different speacies of animals.

In addition to that one might know new experiences from other teachers and learn new teachings methodologies. However, some students think that a studieng in a new country might make one lose concentration on one learning methdology and teaching methodology. It might also be very difficult to be able to pass the examination, because of being in new university, which evaluates some different school subjects, that the previous university doesn't teach them. One more thing, some teacher are not competent in teaching might be emploed at one school or at one university. On this case, the students have a little chance to get information from those unsuitable teachers. At the end, one should collect enough information about the new school, before he goes to it to study. Thank you.

Dear English teacher, thank you for your qestion. I really like learning through hearing English stories and through speaking, after I learn enough grammar. It means, I don't stand writing or . speaking falsely. More than it, I like being qualified to understand the fast speakers.

Leading an inactive lifestyle has many negative effects on health. That is the reason why a proposal has ben put forth: obliging all university students and school children to do sports activities at least three times a week. Is this really a good idea? On the one hand, forcing something like this upon people is very authoritarian. A law forcing the youth to have sports activities would infringe on personal and bodily autonomy. It would give the state more control in our youth's personal lives and diminish their sense of personal responsibility. With freedom comes responsibility, and both of those are very important to have and properly make use of in life. If from a young age the child has great personal atunomy, it will better learn to make use of it than if the state were to interfere. The proposal made above, were it made into law, would stunt our children's ability to administer their own lives. On the other hand, the benefits of sports activities are so great and many that a sacrifice of some freedom may be justified. Physical activity improves both physical and mental health, as well as cognitive abilities. And in the context of schooling, where children are forced to do tasks anyay, it would make sense to make use of the advantages of sport. Moreover, there are generalised benefits for the whole of society. Healthier people get sick less and live longer, putting overall less strain on the public healthcare system. This saves costs, sicne treatment is very expensive, a lot more than prevention in the form of sports activities. This saves taxpayers and the governemnt loads of money. All in all, the benefits of forcing our youth to do sport outweigh any possible objections. They are already obligated to a variety of tasks in school, and adding sport to that would only have benefits.

In my opinion if the group feel comfortable with a specific teacher and the results are satisfactory, then, the best option is maintain the teacher with the same students. However it's known that in the almost the whole schools the students have different teacher for each subject. Which show us that students are used to take classes with different teachers. As from my experience in my life as student in a high school, some of my teachers were changing every semester but my group maintained the same Math teacher for 2 years . He was the best math teacher that I've ever know, the way that he taught made me loved math. In other hand we had different English teacher every year, that was inefficient for us because we couldn't be used to the way to teach from each professor, in consequence we weren't able to learn English. When I finished high school my level English was really poor, so I have to learn it by other school. I think every student has different ways to learn and every professor have different ways to teach, then It's difficult to know what is better for the students because which works to some in occasions doesn't work to others.

Some people believe that nowadays is not necessary to learn languages. The question is why. At present, mobile phone has applications that are translate at the moment. Because for this, many people think that it is not vital. From my point of view, I consider that it is very important to learn a language. My reasons are the following: First,when you are reading a book in English, it is different to read an English book that Spanish book. The meaning of the phrases changes from one language to another. Second, when you learn a languange , your mind changes. That is, there are studies that have demonstrated that if you learn another language (different your mother tongue), you will improve your cerebral cortex. Your brain secretes substance, which help to avoid degenerative illness, like alzheimer. To sum up, I consider that it is very important to learn languages and discover other cultures.

Write and Improve is an app by the Cambrige University made for students in order to improve their writing. I have used this app for a month and therefore will sumerise my experiences in the following. Firstly, I would like to write about the biggest advantage Write and Improve has, namely the check function. This means you can write a text and after completing the task, the programmm checks it for you. This has helped me, not only improve my grammar and vocabulary, but also my style of writing. Another argument worth mentioning is that the app is helpful because there are many different levels of language. Therefore, Write and Improve enables their users to improve and move on to the tasks that best fit their needs. For my last argument, I have to mention an aspect of this website I have not found helpful, which is the costs. Although the first tasks are for free, most of the workbooks have to be paid for. This is a border for learners who do not have the money to pay for the app. In conclusion I can highly recommend this app, since it has helped me and many other users improve the English skills.

I started thinking about this question when I was a child, because when I was eight years old I saw the film "Troy" for the first time in my life. Our history teacher gave us as homework to watch that movie because we were studying the history of the Ancient Greece in that period. I was so impressed by Achilleus's character, because he could have anything he wanted: a long life, a wife, health and a family, but he chose, being aware of the consequences, to leave for Troy, knowing that he wouldn't ever come back home. I couldn't explain to me why, it was totally unobvious for the little girl I was. But then, going on watching the movie, I got it clearly: he was doing it for glory and immortality. Living a long, calm and boring life would have made him unsatisfied: which is the point on living 100 years if your life isn't worth living? Emotions, feelings, experiences are what keep us alive, so I would prefer living a shorter life, but full, lived and not wasted, instead of spending my time doing nothing because everything is dangerous. If you stop a moment and think about the risks, you will understand that everything is risky, so you wouldn't do anything. I'm not talking about having mad experiences, I'm just talking of living freely and fully, tasting every single moment that life has to offer to us. Besides, we have just one life, it's pretty inconvenient to waste it. So I would have left, exactly like Achilleus did, to live the life I wanted for me.

Hello everyone, thank you for giving me this opportunity to answer about this issue. I have to imagine an answer, because I have never been to any necessary holiday. The most important holiday, I have ever been on it is, when I went to country, where there are people, who cannot read and write. I had to go to try to teach them, how they will be able to read without being able to read, if only they will read. The idea might seem too complex at the beginning, but it is not. The word reading is usually be mixed with the word reciting. I have already meant that I have tried to learn people reciting. Why did I want to tell them about this idea? Because the time was too short to help them being able to read and I have read in the history that some knowledgable people were not able to read. It is so, not being able to read does not mean being stupid at all. That is why I taught them, how they can hear something important and interesting and repeat it many times till they can recite it without any difficulties, so can they teach each other, what some proffissors cannot teach their own students. I have been happy to help them break the rock of ignorancy.

The question I will discuss in this essay is the following: should university student and school children be forces to do sports activities at least three times per week? Sport is very important for a healthy lifestyle, but should we force people to do so? Doing any kind of sport certainly has effect on your lifestyle. It is good to exercise your body, it needs to move, otherwise your body just gets stiff and that can cause other health issues. You can just hang on the couch and expect to have a healthy lifestyle. Getting people play sport is a good idea. One reason why it is often included in the curriculum in pimary and secondary school. So even if there are people who do not sport outside of school, they at least exercise once or twice a week. However the question is whether you want to force people into doing sports activities. People don't like to be forced, especially when they do not like the thing they are forced to do. However, with sports activities it is a bit different. There are so many sports nowadays, that it is almost impossible to not like any sport. Each person has their own preference when it comes to exercising. Besides, it is very easy to, for example to young children, hide any kind of sports activity in some fun game. Those high energetic games should be considered sports activities. So you either really have to force people into sports, or somebody should come up with an alternative plan to get people into sports. I think that we should not force people to do sports activities. That is because I think that there really are people who just struggle with getting themselves to do some sort of exercise. However, I do think that playing sports should be more encouraged. Sports clubs can organise fun recruitment days to promote their sport.

In the era of technology, every things change rapidly, among which, education is the most affected. Dating back, books are one of the most essential and crucial tool for education. Replacing the existence of books, computers are now generally used for the sake of learning. On the one hand, some declar that books are the existence that cannot be replace. On the other hand, some counter by comparing the convenience and flexibility between books and computers. In my opinion, the latter one is more preferable than the former. Nowadays, numerous teachers from college to senior high utilize technology to enrich their courses. With a computer at hand, teachers can easily have access to the abundant resources online. Moreover, learning the lessons through the internet, students can ask questions without the restriction of need to be at school. In the light of the above, I think computers and tablets definitely have the potential of completely replacing books in the realm of education.

Practicing sport is necessary for your body but there are really many more necessary measures that protect your health. The most important measure is eating healthy food.

Given the fact that traditional businesses tend to establish enclosed stations in which workers are separated from employers, while several modern offices are designed with open space meaning there is no barrier amid co-workers. In my opinion, working in an open space offers workers creativity and better conversation among them. To begin with, a growing number of companies have been switching old cubicles to spacious design due to its efficient results on workflow. Nowadays, a great number of graduates are not confident enough to show their abilities and desire to stay focused on doing private things in their spare time rather than having a meeting with their co-workers. As a result, most of them find struck in communication and teamwork which leads to the downfall in the whole result's company. As there is no visible barrier, co-workers will have more face-to-face interactions related to work and afterward the workflow might run effectively and smoothly thanks to approachable space. A well-known software corporation called Google has been applying the open design since its establishment, which helps its workers easier in exchanging information and taking a deep breath during work. In conclusion, I reaffirm that open design offers an effective environment in the workplace because the workers find it more convenient in exchanging ideas and information revolving around the work.

If students have the same teacher all the years, it is bored, because it is the same every year, week, every day and it is necessary change, because in real life, studets will be a professional in your area than will work, and in company their, always will change colleagues and boss etc. Change teachers it a learning to all our lives, always the things change to us, at school, at supermarket, at bank, at police, at government, never is forever it is good change and grow up with these changes.

The theme of this essay sounds "Television entertains, but can it also educate?." I agree with the argument that watching TV conditions our well-being. I have been trying to prove the thesis that television seldom educates. Firstly, modern television provides a lot of various programmes, the first place it takes breakfast programmes and telenovelas. Impact of these programmes for our behaviour is enormous, we only wasted time. Secondly, many people watch on TV news, they have been waiting for information, shocking especially. This can be seen primarily among young people. Is this healthy? Of course not, because that could change their way of thinking, understanding reality. We should teach teenagers positive thinking. Thirdly, for all over the world changes, television is replaced by the internet and new technology. We turned the television less and less. Young people spent more time using the Internet website, mobile phones and a lot of platform communication. Obviously, many people like watching TV, but their purpose is not education but only entertainment and fun. Furthermore, today a lot of televisions are controlled by government and business so that shapes our political views and our worldview. This is not okay. It has been demonstrated that television entertains but it's not educational. We could watch TV only for fun but if we want to teach something we should read a book or use a computer and education website.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? When there are more and more computers, tablets, some people asked themselves something like that. To my way of thinking, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Firstly, computers and tablets are much better than books because they can hold a million time more information than a 400-800 pages book. If you want to find something, it will take you 15, 20 even 30 minutes to get infomations from books. But with a computer or a tablet, it would take less than 5 minutes to get them. Secondly, computers and tablets hold much more types of data than a book. If you are carrying a computer or a tablet, that also means you are carrying a thousand books. Finally, they are more convenient. An e-book costs much cheaper than a traditional book. The information in a digital form can be edited, shared easily. This makes them overall convenient for students who might not be able to afford one copy of a book each. In a nutshell, computers and tablets are much more convenient than tradtional books. They should completely replace books in schools and universities.

New technologies have been developed. Researchers from the most famous universities of the world are still studying, focusing on new solutions and technological strategies. These are referring especially to the future of travel. Not only on the Earth, but also in the Space. During the last two centuries, the way of travel from one place to another one has drastically changed. The first industrial revolution provided new transport ways and tools. Ships, trains and so on were the beginning of the Modern Age. Nowadays, cars ,trains, planes and so forth are enhanced by using new smart materials and technological processes. The aim of the most important factories of the world and aerospacial companies, such as NASA and ESA, consists of succeeding in reaching Mars. Concerning travel on the Earth, many tests have been done in these years. A very interesting one is the design of a 'flying car',which is able to carry passengers in the air, among the skygratings of the metropolies. The first prototype is likely to be available on commerce by 2024. This is the proof that travel is bound to be really different in the near future, which will be better and better.

Television is one of the most popular electronic devices used by families. Obviously, Entertainment purpose is accountable for its popularity. Moreover, I believe television can be used as an educational tool which people use to learn new things. There are a variety of programs on TV such as news, travel, food, etc... and people could learn from them. For example, news programs provide information about the world, by watching them, we are aware of what is happening around us. We know about the places, countries or the topics mentioned in the news. Some program are very beneficial especially for children. For instance, children can learn about animals in the wildlife by watching animals programs without actually going to the wild.

Nowadays, people are eating unhealthy food and living an inactive lifestyle. It is argued that all the university students and school pupils should be pushed forcefully to take part in sports games at least 3 times in a week due to negative effect on body of a lazy lifestyle. I agree with this because those activities would help people to live a healthy life and are important for students to focus and concentrate. Even though it is true that sports activities take a lot of one's time, I think these activities are very important for all the individuals, especially for students. One reason for this is that it would lead to them losing weight and leading a much healthier and happier life, so in long run, they would enable them to be an active individual. To illustrate this, recently Norway implemented strict rules and regulations for all the high school students to play games on any three days in a week. This had a dramatic effect on keeping the weight under control. Another reason they are necessary is that students can achieve better results in exams. This is because exercises will make the students tierd, so they can get the sound sleep in the night. This would let them to focus on their classes and understand the subjects better. As a result, they can perform well in shcools and universities and eventually, get a well-paid job. For example, according to extensive research, pupils aged between 10 and 15 who play any kind of spots game do far better in exams than those who don't do any type of activities. To conclude, although students might not find sports games interesting, I think it is important because students can live a beautiful and happy life. Also, they can achieve better marks in schools and universities.

In general a few students enjoy mathematics and physics, it is not the case with arts because almost all love it. They appear that are difficult, however, mathematics and physics are easier than you could think, only need to know the rules and the formulas and that is it. Most students seem to enjoy learning a new language, the classes are funny and interactive. Last year English class was taught by an excellent teacher, but the problem has always been listening and speaking. Its difficult because an hour is not enough to prctice it. The best solution seem to be to take consultancies with a private teacher or taking an extra English course in a language school, moreover I recommend practice for yourself, watch movies, find a native English speaker and practice every day. Remember that practice makes you perfect.

Compared with the television broadcast in other countries, like the United Kingdom or the USA, Italian television is very young. During its first decade, Italian television had, as its first aim, an educational role. Indeed in the 50s more than half of the Italian population was not educated and they did not speak Italian but they speak dialects. RAI, the national television broadcast, had programs to help schools in learning Italian language, history, civics, etc. RAI had its educational role until the 80s, when it changes its aim to compete to private broadcasters. In that decade entertainment overflow the educational role, and, unfortunately, it began to have a bad education on the audience. In the last few decade, national broadcast tried to come back in its educational role, even with such little projects. Today we watch new television channels that they have cultural and educational aim.

In my opinion, learning a new language always is significant. If you learn a new language you can have some opportunity. For instance, some companies work with different country establishments, and they need to intermediary to communicate with them. They can pay a good amount of money for that. There are too many chances if you learn a language. You can teach students in the language course establishment if you know well which you teach language. So, when we learn a language, we can communicate with foreign people or we can find a job. On the other hand, we would visit some country for a different purpose. When we do this, we should learn a language which we will go to the country. If we will go to education like a master's or doctorate, we should learn an academic language. As a result, learning a language takes time but it's a significant no matter when.

The best holiday ever One of the best places that you could visit is without doubt Queretaro, there are many beautiful natural places. Moreover, you can go with your family, friends and also you could take your pets with you. For this reason for our holidays we choose the Sierra Gorda Queretana and San Luis, all the way to these places were awesome and the villages too. Where you can eat traditional dishes and buy handicrafts. However the most awesome places I’ve visited ever were “The half moon and Bridge of god”, where you can swim, camp and take walks. There's a long walk to get to Bridge, it was taken by my family and me. I took lots of pictures but I couldn’t swim because the weather was cold.

I’m excited about the next place where we could have a terrific time again.

In my opinion , use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants should be limited access because of it distubed the public concetration and also the dealing person of particular person. I have two chief reasons to support my view which I wish to explore in this essay. firstly , now a days mobile use is much generalised and most of people don't know the proper way of mobile handling and it is a big issue not only for the mobile user alos the person who are to surrounding of user. As we know, now a days public life is much busy in to their job hence people have limited time or we can say not sufficienrt time for their public work and in that case if he spends extra time because of one's disturbance or due to another person who is talking in mobile at the time of payment or at the time of negotiating in that case only extra time is consumed by the customer because of his mobile call. safety in main concern at public place some time people got accident at the time enting in the bus because he is busy in phone call not seeing the vigilent to foot rest and it is very common type of bus accident due to unaware use of mobile. further to this , in long journey people use to read in public transport and in that case if some one is busy on mobile call and talking loudly that person just distubing the other passenger.

So this would be a huge upgrade for the future

Two years ago I had unhealthy life, exercise was not an option to me . Also I had muchwork in the university, my free time was spending with my friends. However when I started to have health problems then I decided to change my life style. For this reason I took the decision to practise a sporting activity, moreover I change my eating habits as well.

Despite some minuses of changing studying materials for some students, it is vital to sit and study anything you want by using true material. I based my idea on two reasons. First and foremost, provided that you acquire the most beneficial material to learn something, you can most probably learn it. I mean, the better material you use, the much more information you get. For instance, since I started to use a tool called "Write&Improve," my improvement in English becomes excellent. It helps me broaden my vocabulary while writing essays. Secondly, it is unfair to be failed on exams even though you study very much. Nevertheless, when you prepare exams with improper materials, the foregone conclusion will be unsuccessfulness. Thanks to that Write&Improve application, I can manage to enhance my not writing but also vocabulary skills. According to the recent statistics, there are many unhappy students who need some guides to find the most correct tools in order to learn English. All in all, there is no need to waste our precious time with nonuseful tools. Students should be more aware of their own skills and improve them via that Write&Improve tool. Additionally, more advertisements of that tool on the internet might be more helpful for students who try to find it there.

Write and Improve is a writing tool for learners of English. It's a free online tool that allows you to write about many different subjects and get your essay corrected in just a few seconds. In addition, you can check your mistakes and rewrite your essay as many times as you want in order to improve your writing skills. Despite my short time using this tool, I'd like to point out some things about it. Firstly, I think it's a very useful tool, because the tool algorithm doesn't take much time to get the essay corrected. In other words, the tool user can improve his essay faster than if it were with a teacher, thus the learning process becomes more dynamic. However, it should be noted that the corrections shown by the tool are not always perfect and some mistakes may not be highlighted. That is, sometimes, the algorithm shows no mistakes in the essay, but it does not mean that it's perfect. In conclusion, Write and Improve is a tool that gives just a superficial correction of your essay. Finally, I extremely recommend this tool to improve your writing skills, but it's important to remember that these skills can always be improved even if the tool doesn't point out any mistakes.

Ever since humanity was born and landed on this planet, this question had always been asked yet nobody can give a definite answer. It is like the mystery of the black hole you couldn't know it unless you enter it, but you couldn't say it once you enter it. The question is nonetheless the famous question of which is better a long, calm life until 100 years old or a shorter life but much more intense. I couldn't say that my answer will be the right answer but I would prefer living a long calm life, because if you are surrounded with things and people you love there is no need for intense thing to happen. This is because having them beside you will be the most satisfactory feeling you will experience. However, I see why some people will prefer having a short yet intense life because they feel that life is not calculated by how long you lived but by what you experienced. I agree with that but life is something very strange. You will never have a formula to calculate how well is one's life to some the same experience might have a different mark. So, in my opinion I prefer having a long yet calm life rather than a short but intense life. However, I respect everyone's opinion. Peace and love.

Schools have been playing an important role in the development of mankind for centuries. However, schools will be changing in some aspects as the society has always been developed. I believe schools still provide educational environments where people come to acquire their knowledge, but with the development of technology, they might be transferred from physical places to online institutions which could be more convenient and affordable. On the one hand, what will never be changed is that schools still provide learning spaces for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Also, schools are where experts in many fields gather with the dedication to share their knowledge. On the other hand, schools will have to emerge to adapt to the changing society. Nowadays, people are busy and not everyone has time to go to a physical school so that the demand to learn remotely is pretty clear. Many schools will have to set up online programs to meet that demand. With the development of technology, moving online is not very difficult. Teachers and students can interact with each other without meeting in person. That kind of education is not only flexible but also convenient and cheap. To conclude, I think schools will be playing their role as they used to be, but online education will be popular in the future

Dear Billal, Thank you for your email yesterday. I'm happy that you passed the last exam and you could fly with friends to Africa to your aunt. I can't wait when you will show me photos and films from a trip. How long are you planning to stay there? Write to me, please, when you have landed. I was with my school friends on a trip in Warsaw. We started from Radomsko about 7 a.m. and three hours later we were already in our Capitol. We parked near the old city so we could sightseeing Kings' Castle and Column Zygmunt III Waza. From the old city we could see amazing views, especially of the National Stadium. In the old city we spent about three hours. Our teacher prepared creative trial games and we must search many places and talk with other people. What is your favourite place in the old city in our Capitol, Billal? At 12.00 we could hear the Warsaw anthem from tower clock Kings' Castle. I recorded, if you want I can send you this incredible video. I heard almost an anthem in Cracow when we visited this city last year. Sounds great! At 2 p.m. our teacher organized an appointment with a non-government organization - Polish Foundation of Schuman. Volunteers told us about many projects, events and happenings, for example: Schuman Parade. I love this event! I have been in Schuman Parade a lot of times, I met many pro european young people. We discussed the future of European Union, Polish place and position in the EU. What do you think about the future of the EU, Billal? Are you thinking that the EU should be more united and new countries have access or not? Returning to my trip to Warsaw. After an appointment with NGOs we had lunch. Two hours later we went for a walk in the Kings' Bathrooms. You don't believe me, Billal! We met here President of Warsaw! We could take photos with him and talk about important matters of our country. I have recorded when he greeted our school! You should see it! We have been back to Radomsko at 9 p.m., tired, on the last leg but we have been happy! Billal, I'm happy and enjoying my trip. Every activity was amazing. It was a great time! Write to me quickle, please! Warm regards, Elizabeth.

Hardly one week goes by without an article about an adventerous person who is trying or managed to break a record in sports or in any other competitive area. Who is the best, the riches, the fastest or the most beautiful one? It seems that this successes marks the new standard which we should be able to achieve, if we work hard enough and dream big enough. Characteristicly for this approach, is also the trend of self-help books and videos with catching titels such as "how to be successful in one month" or "how to get rich in only one year." Those titels attract a customorship which has a self-impression of not being sufficiant. The normal life has transformed to "the life you had before you lived the better life." Personally, I would like living a nice regular life and pass my 100 years with reading or walking through summery forests. Intensity should not be mistakenly seen as happiness. To live an enjoyable life is a myriad challenge, if not the greatest of all. During my 100 years I will have to overcome many hurdles which makes some days less bright than others, but in the end I will look back to my summerly forest walks and the many books I will have read and the many inspiring conversations, and surley not think about how boring it was.

Firstly, I think some university students decide to move away in order to be more independent and to start to live on their own. That is, these students want to have more privacy and more control of their own lives. According to some research, these students may be more prepared when they have to live without parents support. In other words, they might deal better with adulthood. However, it all depends on how the parents have raised their children and consequently how the students will deal with the university environment. Another key fact to remember is that the university environment is not always pleasant and sometimes it can be traumatic for some people due to prank calls, low support and other things. In conclusion, there is no universal answer for the question about students moving away when they go to the university. To put it more simply, there is no common better choice, because it must be decided in each situation.

If it can do that, I should think it's a wonderful software for learning English.

I think it is better for students to have the same teacher for several years. Students and teachers all need time to be familiar to each other. The is a period for each other to adapt. If students change teacher every year, they will be alwasy spending time for the same thing. For teachers, it's important to know the ability, character and personality of all students. With this information, teachers can then use proper method to teach different types of students. For students who lack confidence in their ability, the teacher might create attainable goals. For students who lack interest in studies, the teacher might use interesting way to make it fun. There is one proverb, Teach students according to their aptitude. For students, it takes time to adapt the teaching style of a teacher. Some teachers focus on the class communication, while others focus on the homework. Students usually perform better after they are used to the schedule. That's why I think it's a better way for students to have the same teacher for several years.

Nowadays we have two groups of people. People from one group prefer to lead a calm life, in small cities, where they can find peace. They try to avoid stress so they live longer. At the same time the other one chooses to have an intense life, with loads of changes, it provides their lives with loads of fun and joy. Nevertheless, changes are related to stress, what might be one of the reasons for premature dead. Living a long and calm life might be a dream for lots of people. Even though following businesses and careers is popular nowadays, some people prefer to lead their lives in a different way. They prefer to spend time in a loving community, with their families. They tend to choose light jobs and mostly they enjoy little things. However, sometimes those people might become bored with their routines and be unhappy. Living an intense life might be a good choice for some people, but for the others it could be overwhelming. I think enjoying each of the days and not being bored is a domain of people who have an intense life. By doing something they love, they fulfill their passions and dreams. Nevertheless, in some cases a high pace of life might lead to stress and disorders that might interfere with plans of living a long life. Taking everything into consideration I think I would choose to live a longer without loads of stress, because I'm a calm person who likes being healthy.

The school is one of the most important steps of people's life and it must be good for everyone. For this reason, I think that changing teachers every year is one of the worst things that school has. In fact, with the same teacher students can be followed by a complete educational path that includes also a straight school program. When a new teacher arrives, he has to check the knowledge of the class and, in general, he must repeat plenty of things because he doesn't know what the students have studied or what was the previous teacher's method. It's also true that changing teachers could be good to avoid bad professors but with an effcient school system and prepareted teachers students can really benefit from it with a consequent increasing of their preparation and general knowledge and establishing a great empathy with who could be one of the most influential person on a student's life.

In my opinion video games represent a great hobby for children but they must be limited. As everything, they have good and bad things. In fact, they are not a useless thing because, due some studies, they can help children improving their skills and intelligence. But they are also instructive for them because there are several games, such as games with a story line or a plot based on mythology or history, which can help children increasing their knowledge, their interests and educating them about important values like love, respect or bravery too. Obviously they have also negative things, such as inadact games for people under eighteen years or the easy access to the community. The latter can be a good thing but, for children, it can be also dangerous especially without a parent's supervision which could avoid any type of cyberbullying. So, I think video games are a great instrument for children but hey must be used wisely.

The future of travel Do you ever wonder about the future of travel? I’ve always imagined how technology could change the ways to travel around the world. It’s why I did a research about the currently progress about it. Firstly the ways in which we travel have changed dramatically. The transport is faster and cheaper, such an airplanes, boats. Another thing is the fact that if you want to know other places you'll be able to do it through virtual tours even though we'll be able to do space travel. In other hand the attractions will be the same, along the years people always want to visit the same places, pyramids, museums, archeological sites and so on. Other things to consider are unexpected trip cancellations, delays and emergencies will continue to occur. In conclusion people think that in the future will be easier travel, almost everyone will be able to pay for a trip and the space trips will be a possibility. But we must be aware that there will be situations about travel that won’t change and cannot be avoided like bad weather or technical problems.

In my view keep animals in nature it is the best thing to do, because all the animals need to breathe and feel the nature, is them nature, they need live in your habitat natural to survive. Habitat natural of humans is together with a familiy or some other human, we survives having conversations and interactions with other humans and changing expericeses, is necessary to us havee a good life with everyone. Although it is a good idea leave animals in zoos, because they always will have food and a good place to sleep, and puppies too, but is wrong leave they arrested. The best way about that, is if just leave animals that get hurt and were rescued, in this case I think is safe and health of animals stay some time in zoos and after release to nature, and never keep brokenin the cage. If kids and teens want to learn about animals, search in the internet.

First of all, music is a wonderful thing that a lot of people around the world love. Many schools give their students music sessions but others do not give them. I really don't think these differences are good. I love listening to music but not playing it so a student like me doesn't need the music session so now we have to find a solution. Now we could give every student a paper that ask him if he wants to take the music session or no. The students who need it could take it but the others would have a free session with the metron or they could practise any subject they want. Other solution is changing the form of the music session ,for example, we could separate it into two halves, the first one will be for listening and singing if the students want to. The second halve will be for playig music but the students who don't want to can go to their class. All in all schools shouldn't have differences in music sessions a long d or to make students do what they don't like.

On the one hand, I consider that you can go anywhere in the world as long as you have a vaccination passport. I think that the vaccines will be obligatory , therefore, if you do not have vaccines you cannot enter. I am sure that the countries themselves will take care of who enters and if it is legal or not, this will be for the common good. On the other hand, I consider that the way of travelling in Spain is changing. Spanish will travel in Spain and they will discover amazing new places. It is true that the part economy will change. For this Spain should learn and improve and create new activities to be productive. Only in this way will Spain be able to create wealth.

In my opinion, during the time zoos are becoming dangerous for the environment. In fact, in the last century, the environment has been damaged too much by pollution and by the destruction of green zones. For this reason, zoos represent a dangerous way of alterating the natural habitats of animals which are, during recent years, in lower number. I think animals must be free of any type of artificial jails that carry only the destruction of the normal nature life. I think that in our digital era, animals can be studied and people can learn also by documentaries and innovative ways, such as videos or through the virtual reality. Maybe somebody can say that zoos are useful to preserve the animals that risk the extinsion, but I think that they are wrong, because zoos were only made for human's fun, without any consideration of animals' needs. So, risky animals can be supervised into a specific area that is limited but preserves the natural habitat of them. In conclusion, I can say that a world without zoos could be a better world.

In my opinion, studying abroad is one of the best features of school. In fact, in our world that is always much globalized, international experiences are really important for students that will be the future society. By this way they also have the possibility to visit new countries and meet people all around the world, meeting also different cultures and different ideas which, for me, can open their minds to the entire world. For the didactic aims, these projects are useful to accelerate a language study or improving students' skills. But, I can say that these prohects could be very difficult for shy people or people that are not fit for this type of experience that could be one of the most difficult parts of their life. On the other hand, this experience can be also helpful for them because it can give the possiblity to go beyond these limits and becoming a better person. In conclusion, I think that studying abroad is a great experience that can only carry benefits to people that could enjoy it.

The reason is simple, working in cities will make them earn a lot of money. This is because the government are more likely to focus on upgrading facilities in cities rather than in rural areas. Systematically, this will make medical facilities in rural area hard to be accesed by the community. And the impact is; medical treatment will not be on demand in rural area. This causes no balance between the salary for working in cities and in rural areas. This can be solved by the government themselves with the community's support. We have to raise the voice of rural areas people to remind the government, that they existed. By doing this, we hope government can be more concern for facilities and medical development in rural areas, so their economy will also develop. And medical facilities will be more accessible for the rural communitity, and then medical doctors will be in demand and will create a balance of salary between working in cities and in rural areas. Despite this problem, medical doctors should not choose their workplace based on salary. Yet, they should consider being the hero in places that need medical treatment, but hardly accessible.

I am very excited about this new school year! During the last summer I've studied to be prepared to this moment and I'm ready to start. In general, I really like mathematics, physics and English which are my favourite subjects. I think that maths is my passion because I enjoy studying it and, in my opinion, it is very interesting. On the other hand, I really like physics because it gives me the possibility to understand how our world works and I think that's incredible. Then, English is a beautiful language for its phonetic and for the culture that is related to it. So, I would like to improve my knowledge about these three subjects that are, for me, the most important subjects for my future.

Two years ago I went on holiday in the USA, in particular in New York. I think it was the best experience I ever had. First of all, I spent there one week, arriving there in June. While I was arriving at my hotel, I could see the magnificent city that New York was and still is. There was a particular atmosphere, very different from my own country. When I arrived, the receptionist was very friendly and, after the check-in, I went up to my room to leave my things. After that, I went to Central Park (that was very close to my hotel), where I was completely blinded by the magnificent place that it was. Here, there was a students group that invited me to join them and, after a few hours walking through the park, they guided me towards the city. There, they showed me the delicious restaurant of New York and beautiful places such as the famous Statue of Liberty and the iconic Wall Street. After a few days I had to leave, but it was the best holiday of my life because in New York I met the people that are, nowadays, my best friends.

Today, my class have had a discussion on the importance of exercise. In my opinion, exercise is one of the most important things in our life, that is as important as activities like eating or drinking water. In fact, without a regular exercise, we can't carry a healthy life that has consequences upon other activities too. For example, we can't work without a healthy body nor study without a healthy regular life. I think that people ignore too much the benefits of physical activity, that are very important for our lives. Over the years, studies have shown that exercise gives the possibility to reduce stress, has a great impact on several factors like tranquillity and focusing. For these reasons people should include exercise between the most important activities they do every day, dedicating one or two hours for it. I think that this routine can't only carry the benefits previous explained, but also let people enjoying themselves much more.

Both choice have their own pros and cons. Moving away from family might seem like living in freedom, interesting and exciting, yet the reality is not like we expected. We have to manage ourselves to live healthily and organized. Otherwise, we will not be able to do well in our study programme and could cause our grades to collapse. But as we usually known, the pro is; we will have more freedom to explore anything we want. We also can use this opportunity to practise living alone for the future, because we cannot live with our parents forever. Living with family while attending universities is great for those who wants to focus on studying. Our family can keep our needs in control, so we do not need to worry on our economy nor our daily needs. But watch out, we cannot have such freedom like if we are living on our own. I prefer to live on my own because this whole life is about challenge and experiences. I think by moving away and live on my own, I could explore more things and enjoy the transition of my life. I believe that I could manage things well and will not cause any disruption to my academic studies.

What is more important: health or wealth? Different people have different answers to this critical question. Every day, we see people sacrifice sleep in order to work extra hard and secure monetry gains. We also see people spend their hard earned money to treat a disease that has caused them a lot of pain. There seems to be a cycle of prioritizing wealth and then realizing that what is important is health unitl a person feels well. In my opinion, money is very important particularly in the current competitive world, but it is just a means to an end not an end; what people should aim for is living a healthy life which are free from sickness. To begin with, one's happiness is not fully dependent on whether he has money or not, but it is clearly about not experiencing chronic pain whether mentally or physically. It is true that sometimes having money can eliviate the pain, but it also could cause the pain. To illisturate, think of afflunt people. compared to average person, they experience a lot of stress and worry due to the possibility of losing their wealth.

What are my reasons for learning English? I had to think about this question while I was studying English becasue I felt that I was losing my motivation and not performing as I should. After thinking, I found that I study English for the following reasons. First, I want to learn English because I need to access the massive content written in that lanaguage. As we all know, English is the most spoken language in the world, and in it a large content, such as books, movies, etc., has been produced. By being able to read and understand English, I can easily consume the information and learn from them and that will greatly help me succeed in my life. Second, English has become the language of business, and anyone who wants to do business on a global scale has to learn it. Due to development of transportation method and communication, it became possible to trade with other organizations from different countries, and for successful interaction, there must be a common language between the two parties.

An old Chinese curse states: I wish you to live in interesting times. We definitely all live in interesting times now. Everything changed in 2019 when the coronavirus pandemic started. We will face the consequences for a long time. How they would affect our ways of travelling? One thing is certain: it would not be the same. First of all, in 2021 we still may be forced to focus on domestic trips. Before the roll out of the vaccine there will be obstacles in crossing the borders. I expect that the situation may go back to normality in early 2022. Secondly, the costs of the plane tickets may rise dramatically. A lot of airlines went bust and those that continue operating may be forced to cut losses. Apart from that, even before the pandemic, some of the people claimed that we shouldn't use the planes because of the environmental issues. Does that mean that we will stay at home? I don't think so. Maybe we will switch into electric cars and trains? We will see soon.

Poland is a country where we struggle to improve the health system. A lot of things has changed but there are still a lot to do. One of the most serious issues is lack of medical doctors in rural areas. They usually prefer to work in big aglomerations or even go abroad to countries like Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. What is the reason for this situation? In my opinion, main cause is the salary. In rural areas doctors usually earn less than those who work in big cities. Secondly, life in rural areas is less interesting. Doctors study at Universities which are located in big cities and they are used to the hustle and bustle. Living in a small village may seem very boring at first glance. What can be done about this? I believe there are several options possible. First of all our government should raise the salaries of doctors who decided to move to remote area of thecountry. Secondly, there should be investments made in the infrastracture. Fast trains and good roads would allow fast travel.

I have watched many films in the past, and I have a few that I prefer more than others. If I have to choose one to be my favorite, it would be Leon the Professional. It was filmed in the 90s in New York City and has unusual and interesting story that made it the top in my list of favorite movies. The movie begins in an apartment building in one of New York neighbourhoods, and in it there in a family that hardly can be called a family. There were frequent shouting and arguments; no body got along with others. It is not suprising when it become known that the father is involved in illegal activities with criminals and corrupt police men. One day, the corrupt police men invaded the building and broke into the apartment. they search every room in the apartment looking for drugs that they have given to the father. As soon as they learned that he does not have the drugs, every one was murdered without mercy even a small child. Right before the police men arrive in front of the building, a young girl, who was about 8 years old, had just left her troubled family to get a break from all the negative energy and also to bring some milk. She was lucky, but she still need to return to her family. She had no other place to go. While she is entering the building, she felt that something is wrong. She could hear noise that is not familiar. She continued cautously, and when she approaced the door of her apartment, there was a well-built man carrying a machine gun. Frightened, she did not stop and contiued walking straight passing her apartment door; she peeked and saw her father on the floor covered in blood. She knew what happened, but tried her best not to show any emotion, or she will also be killed. While walking, a door blocked her way. It is a neighbor's apartment door. After a moment of hesitations, she knocked on the door a few times and waited for rescue. As she was losing hope of escaping that tough situation, the door opens. She felt like it was the door of heaven. It was Leon, who opened the door, a professional hitman. He was watching the whole event and know what happened to her family. He saved her, but he is now responsible for her as she has nobody. How could a hitman take care of a child whose entire family was just murdered?

A great number of university students live far from home and live independently. However, other ones live at home with their family members. I am of opinion that students who live far from home have a greater chance to develop their soft skills, and this essay will outline a couple of reasons. To begin with, Living independently has been commonly regarded as an essential element in a person's development because of its beneficial impacts on other aspects in person. A student living far from home must adopt their surroundings by expanding a wide range of relationships with other counterparts and getting used to a series of unexpected situations revolving around mainly financial burden. The practical experience helps the student stronger and confident not only in school life but also at a societal level. Besides, the university period offers students especially those who live far from home numerous wonderful opportunities, like either getting a part-time job or involving a voluntary campaign, to develop their soft skills including presentation, and team-working which are really essential after graduation. Without the time restriction by their parents, a living far from home student at university could spend hours hanging out or studying in a group with other students which helps bridge the gap between them and constitutes long-standing relationships that might last for decades. In conclusion, although university students living independently face numerous emerging situations due to the lack of their relatives, this also offers multiple amazing chances. Having part-time jobs and acquiring long-standing relationships helps the students become mature.

Firstly, I think that volunteer work should be a requirement to graduate in all the schools, because there are several benefits in this type of activity. For example, it's an opportunity to learn about new subjects, including things outside of your social environment. In addition, an American research from Michingan University stated that people who practice volunteer work live about four years more. Similarly, another research proved that volunteer workers have a better balance between their professional and personal lives and, consenquently, less stress and more positive energy. Despite many people say it's a waste of time, volunteer work can change people minds in a good way by making them be more sensitive and, therefore, understand better the social problems. In conclusion, a certain amount of volunteer work can be very helpful in order to develop better students as human beings, because that is also included in the school missions.

The technological development is our present and it will be our future. For this reason, it will surely influence the way we travel nowadays, hoping that it will make it better. During the years experts and engineers have focused their knowledge and capacity on artificial intelligence that will lead the world's logistic in the future. One of the most important examples is the authomatic drive (or smart drive) which is the idea (and actually the present) of authomatic cars and veichles. This technology will not only change our own vehicles, but will change the public transport too. In fact, in the next years, we will probably able to find authomatic cabs or buses that won't need a driver, making transports more efficient and quick. On the other hand, also private cars will have the possibility to be driven by a specific authomatic system which will make streets safer than now and reducing risks related to driving.

The school of the future Have you ever think about how will be the schools in the future? As a teacher I’ve always wondered what the school will be in the future. The world is in constant change: medicine, communications and education has been changed as well and we know that education system needs to be innovated. Firstly with news technologies and the internet, everyone has easy access to information, in consequence teachers will not longer the only source of information, so they will become as guide. Secondly, skills such a public speaking will be more important than academic knowledge. However skills won't supplant academic preparation and you will still have to learn Mathematics, science or history. Then professional certifications will be important but never as important as an academic degree. To sum up, the educational system needs to link to the needs of a changing society, we have more access to the information and we can learn thing by our own, but a professional degree and help by professors always will be important and essential.

As far as I am concerned, schools will change a lot by the reason for some situations such as diseases. In addition, I should have mentioned technology too. Nowadays, education is run through the schools. Constantly, they are taught by teachers. Thus, the students create their attitudes, personality and life styles for their future life. If they are successful, their success will be beneficial and a huge convenience for them. Appearently, the students will take up online lessons. However, first of all it will be hard to learn and many children won't adapt immediately. They haven't had lessons like that before. Therefore, they are not capable of understanding everything clearly. Besides, they won't manage to do their duties easily. Governments are recommended to supply requirements such as computers. Technological devices must be given to the poor kids by the government because many children don't have adequate money to afford the online education. Consequently, in my opinion, the schools will change deeply. Although the schools change their style, the requirements mustn't be ignored. Students are such a tremendous, exceptional people that we mustn't forget to consider them.

In my opinion, in the future schools will follow the technological development that is characterizing our world nowadays. I imagine a totally digital school, where books will be replaced by computers and everything will be faster than now. Schools could become smart facilities fitted for the didactic aim, with digital features or digital functions which will be useful for students. For example, there could be digital courses mixed with normal course, or a more specific didactic that will teach how to use robots or how to work with them. So, I think over the years students will be smarter and more competent than now so there will be a greater society. On the other hand, I think that something will be the same as now. For example, school will still include the human contact between students and teachers won't be completely replaced by computers or robots in order to make schools composed by a human aspect.

To begin, I am going to talk about if I believe that television can entertains and also educate. On the one hand, I consider that Television should be more educated because it is possible that some type of programme can distorts reality. The younger people believe that it is possible to earn money by doing anything. On the other hand, I consider that nowadays television is changed, especially with the programmes . For example, there is new show called "El condesador de Fluzo" and I think it is perfect for undertanding history or to discover new things. Besides, who go to the show explain historical event very well. In this show there are writers, comedians and historians of all kinds. To sum up, I would like to say that I really think that television is changed for the better. Especially for young people do not fall into stereotypes.

In my opinion television is a good vehicle to educate but it is often bad for that aim. In fact, there are programs that could be very diseducative for young people which could give a bad vision of the world, such as gossip's programs or violent cartoons and series, but also with programs that include a bad language that could influence people that watch it. On the other hand, television has great features that could make it great for education, such as the news, films' channels, sport's channel and so on. But I think that nowadays people are looking to something different from television. For example, people prefer using digital sites and their features to search something that they don't know, learn new languages or discover new things every day. In conclusion, I think that television is a valid educational vehicle but it will be replaced by digitalization soon.

There are fewer and fewer places for animals to live on earth now. It's a natural trend when people population growing up. Unless we can control our population and the resource well, it is really hard to reserve many places for animals. Under these conditions, I think zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Although it might be cruel for these animals since they lost their freedom. But if zoos can provide proper care for these animals, they might feel not so bad in the zoo. At least, like people, some like to work hard and some like to take a rest. I think it should be similar for the animals. Without the zoos, many animals might disappear from Earth in a few years. In contrast, zoos can help to keep these some animal from disappearing due to the population, farming and deforesatation destroying natural habitats. On day when most people learn to respect natural and can live with animals, we can free these animals to the natural.

My reasons for learning English Nowadays, more and more non-native speakers have learned and mastered English due to different reasons. Most of them have done it for their studies or work. On average, most of them have learned English in their childhood. As I was a child, I have also learned English in school. However, English learning in the Chinese school is primarily focusing on passing the exam, not on mastering the language in daily life or work. Therefore, I still need to improve my spoken and writing English. And there are several reasons for it. Firstly, I need to master English for my master program since all my finance courses are held in English. And in two months, I must write my master thesis in English as well. Secondly, I need it for job seeking. Since the finance segment is very international, job seekers must speak and write English and German very well, even in Germany. Thirdly, according to my experience, when I master English, I can communicate with my children in English and help them learn English at an early age. So They will not have the same problems that I suffer now.

There is no doubt that earning money is crucial in our life, to grant our lives necessities, as well as being healthy is crucial to do your daily jobs and chores. Money come and go, while health is a treasure. In some cases health may not get back in some permenant diseases. Moreover a sound mind can lead you to more than wealth, and to have sound mind you should have a healthy body. people who care about their health can enjoy their times, with their families and their children, without complaining of any pain. Furthermore healthy people may live longer than those who suffer from illnesses. Not having any disease is a reasonable reason to tend to care about health more than wealth, since having disease may cause permanent pains, which will be an obstacle for many times to eat freely, or going to some places, or doing hobbies, or even move, while healthy person doesn't have to care about any of these eventually.

I don't agree with the idea that computers and tablets will completely replace books in schools and universities. I have two reasons to support the idea. At first, there is a lot of information in books which are held in school's libraries. Indeed, you can access what you want to know immediately with your computer these days. You can easily obtain the information online. However, the quantity and quality of the information in books are greater than those on the internet. Besides, the most of online information has not been reviewed by any other person. Thus, the precision of the information is not guaranteed. If you are a university student, it is good for you to find the information in the library. You can open a new world through many books. Secondly, there is an advantage that you can write down anything and save it in your book. If you find some information online, you can not write something on the website. To understand what you want to know, writing is a crucial factor because the movement of your finger accelerates your working memory in the brain. By writing something in a book, you can gain a deeper understanding of the matter. For your study in university life, it is important to recognize things deeply, because researching activities need a lot of knowledge. To sum up, books are required in universities to make students understand things deeply.

In my opinion, the workspace configuration is significantly important to increase efficiency in work. When the offices have a more open design, it can distract more the employees. On the other hand, office partitions provide privacy and sophistication, besides improving the workspace organization. In spite of the fact that an open design office is known as a more modern concept, an American research stated that many employees have difficulties to concentrate on work, therefore it's essential to reduce distractions in workspace in order to increase efficiency. Moreover, there are other things which can similarly improve efficiency in work, such as lighting, temperature, table heigh, chair comfort and many other characteristics of the office. In conclusion, enclosed workstations is the most effective type of arrangement, because there are less distractions and, consequently, less wasted work time. In addition, some other improvements in the office can be done to increase efficiency, as exemplified previously.

Most people are pursuing their dreams to be rich, but not many people take care of their health. You can say money is what our lives are all about; however, I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. First of all, having physical or mental diseases prevents you from being happy even though you are rich. Our goals and dreams stand on the foundation of being happy. If you had a million dollars and severe disease, your money would lose its value because you might not have enough time to spend all of it, and even more, you would want to spend it to cure your disease. That means health is more valuable than money. Whether you are rich or not, you can still be happy having your loved one or successful career. But without being healthy, you end up being unhappy.

Indeed, video games are very popular for children. I can say that I have also play video games when I was teenager. I can´t support that children play video games. Because they get very distracting and it is very difficult to focus on the important things. There is no end and you can play video games for hours. You are also missing a lot of things, you will stay the whole at your home and you won't leave your place. It is very important doing any sport and physically activities. Furthermore you maybe have samo social interactions with friends during playing video games. But I would say that it is different meeting people in reality than only just about playing games. You can't control it, that makes it so difficult. Children are getting very familiar with a computer, playing network and with children with the same preferences. At the end I can't recommend it, particularly for young children. At the other hand the also a lot of good examples with teenager which have spent a lot of time in video gaming and nowadays are successfully and working in this field.

One question is about having different teachers is good or not, and I am gonna answer the question. I am a student right now and I think I have a real answer for the question. This has two sides, the good and the bad. On the good side of having different teachers we can open our vision about the subject we are studying, on another hand we can find the teachers that we love to work with and that is the best for students. Also we can have more new relationships with profession, that is the good side. And on the bad side we can not maintain learning with the teacher we love to study with, and maybe the way the different teachers teach are not interesting us and make the classes become boring. That is the worst thing on the bad side of having different teachers. After all I think the good things or the bad things of have different teachers are depend on us, depend on the way we face it, depend on our attitude. If we can face it well the good things are so many than the bad things. It good or not is dependent on the way we face it. that's it.

Your marvelous fortune won't be important anymore. Perhaps, you will marry someone who lacks love, enthusiasm, and empathy. I mean, a person who won't appreciate you. Accordingly, you won't be happy unless you find someone who loves you. Therefore, I would like to conclude by saying that, your money will not be valuable if you don't have soulmate and health. You will be always looked down on by people who have health. My recommendation is for you to be aware of your treasure.

In my opinion, this is a paradoxical statement. In general, I think that health is surely the most important thing in people's lives because without it we wouldn't be able to do anything. On the other hand, in countries like the USA, the sanity is not free, and poor people could be discirminated from sanity treatment. It is also true that middle class' people can live healthily without a huge richness, but it's also true that there are rare illness that require specific operations and treatment, and they could be too expensive for them. Otherwise, I think that everyone should have access to every sanitary treatment, but it is actually a utopian idea due to the economics problems that are involving the world. For this reason, I think that the two things are truly connected much more than people expect, because without health wealth couldn't exist, but without richness, nowadays, health is not guaranteed for everyone.

Is this important to always tell the truth? I would say yes but not for every situation. There might be a lot of time we spend on seeking somewhere we prefer to live in and will be little in doubt about people around. Living in an environment where people tend to tell the truth is the guaranty of being always clear on social systems and transparency of any relationships. It's definitely view of life we all have been trying to build in. One for addition, I know we had been taught to tell the truth since very early childhood that was a basic installment for the awareness of any situations later. So that we are likely to feel apologetic if we have to lie to someone. In the other hand, it is also important not to tell the truth. We are required to lie to someone if this is good for them or simply for protecting ourselves in some certain circumstances. I remember it called 'white lie' which is forgiven easily as you find it the most possible selection to choose. If you are not able to tell the truth and this does not take its toll on anything or anybody, it is fine to do then but you should accept one thing signifcant is that you may be less believable for others later in life. Take all factors mentioned into account, telling the true holds an important role in our lives. But it is completely acceptable to make the lie depending on circumstances and we need to ensure that we have positive reason to do it.

I believe that having different teachers can bring benefits to students. First, each teacher transfers knowledge to the student through a unique methodology. Therefore, if the studant has only one teacher for several years, that student will not learn different things in different ways. Second, different teachers are able to share many points of views or perspectives about a topic. It can help the students develop critical thinking and develop their thoughts. If the student has only one teacher for several years, that student will, soon or later, imitate his teacher's thoughts. Third, if the student has had many teachers for several years, it can help the student shape his character. Therefore, the student can observe, analyze and then decide what is right and what is wrong. Fourth, each teacher deals with different situations in different ways. In addition, if the student has many teachers, they won't became boring. In short, having many teachers has more pros than cons.

I have heard that you, as town council, is thinking about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think this idea needs to be analyzed carefully. Firstly, due to the increasing use of mobile phones in public spaces, an American research stated that people are losing the ability to have a real conversation. As evidence, nowadays it's common to go to a restaurant and see people around the table, all of them just using their cell phones without talking to each other. In other words, people are become increasingly addicted to mobile phones that they are not paying attention to the real world. Therefore, banning use of cell phones in these places would force them to strike out a conversation with someone and be more aware of their surroundings. Despite this, the use of mobile phones has allowed people to contact someone quicker. For this reason, cell phones can be very helpful to get people in touch especially in emergencies. These emergencies embrace all the types, such as work and health emergencies. In sum, banning completely the use of mobile phones on public spaces, like restaurants, shops and public transport, is not the right choice to do. In my opinion, the use should be permitted only in emergencies, because it's impossible to ignore some benefits of cell phones in modern life.

I do not believe that computers can completely replace books in schools and universities. At least for while, the books have a great importance in the students, and teachers, and professors life.

But many educators like to use the paper books, however I can predict it will be difficult to use it in the future, it will be no practical to edit a book in this way, the nature and the trees thank. I guess that in the future the virtual books will be used more and more. They will be more technological interesting, with animation, with dynamic graphics, for instance.

Firstly, an American research stated that telling the truth all the time time has several benefits to human health. For instance, it can be less stressful to your life, because you do not need to overthink or to be worried all the time about the possibility of being caught. Moreover, it improves your memory considering that telling a lie demands some cognitive effort and this can be harmful to your mind overtime. To put it more simply, always telling the truth can provide a better life quality. However, in some cases, the truth can be painful and unpleasant to your listeners. To give an illustration of that, sometimes a person is in a bad mood and expect some compliments to encourage her, but you decide to tell the truth by saying desmotivating words. In this situation, the truth hurt the other person feelings and certainly did not improve her life quality or reduce her stress. Therefore, telling the truth is not always the better choice, unless it's related to violate a law. In this case, the truth is better, because you are going to get caught either way. On the other hand, when it envolve people feelings, it's important to analyze each situation carefully, owing to the influence that the words can affect other people minds in a good or in a bad way.

Regarding whether learning to speak a foreign language is as important nowadays as it was in the past, the answers differ among different groups of people. More specifically, the answer to this question depends mostly on people's education level and occupation type. On average, the more educated people are, the more likely they learn a foreign language. While most blue collars or people who only work locally may not need to learn to speak foreign languages, most white collars or people who work in an international atmosphere must master at least one foreign language, especially English. Due to the dramatic development of globalization and international trading, mastering one or more foreign languages is seen as an essential skill that employers will expect from their employees. Besides work, there is also an increasing need to speak foreign languages in the vacation if you travel to other countries. There is a general increasing requirement of speaking foreign languages, e. g., English these days than in the past.

Personally, I have several reasons for learning English. First of all, over past years the English language has become the most important language of the world and it is nowadays an international language that is spoken by everyone. For this reason, learning English is not only a pleasure but also a duty to be part of a globalized world as it is in our present. On the other hand, I really like the phonetic as well as the culture that is related to it. In fact, I think that the traditions and the story of this language are very fascinating. For me, learning English is also a great opportunity to have a speed contact with computers, where English is the universal language. In the end, I think that English should be taught at a high level of quality in every country, to give the opportunity to everyone to communicate without any barriers.

In my opinion, learning a foreign language nowadays is easier than before. In fact, only from 20th century learning a foreign language has become an important point into people's education. Otherwise, today the level of teaching is much more than before because learning a foreign language, especially English, is too important to be ignored. In fact, English is taught from the primary school and there are a lot of courses to improve the knowledge of the language. On the other hand, I think there still is a low level of knowledge of foreign language because there are many people who don't understand any language different from their own. That is, in the 21st century, a bad thing because in our world which is more globalized than before, people who will understand only their own language will be cut off the society.

I think both options are very good. I like it when I can experience different types of learning. When you have only one teacher he knows you very well. When he likes you he will give you probably good grades. The problem is when he doesn't like you, he will give you bad marks. I like it when your teacher switch thourgh the school years. You get to know different views about one topic. Moreover you have evrytime a new chance to get good marks, because it is every time a new start. The teacher gets to know you. I think the best length for one teacher is for about three years. in this time you can get to konw your teachter and other way round. Moreover you know how the class test are structured and you can prepare well. In the Abitur you get a test, which isn't from your teacher, therefore it is good, when the teacher changes through the years.

Regarding whether computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities, the answers differ among people. Some agree with this view, and they argue that learning with computers and tablets are more efficient and eco-friendly. The increase of learning with laptops will reduce paper usage and, therefore, the damage of forests. Furthermore, it is more convenient to take the laptops than heavy books around. Finally, it is also much practical to store important files on the cloud,and it can be reached without location restrictions In contrast, others oppose this opinion, and they state that they are more used to learn with books and do exercise with pens. As it showed in several studies, students who learn with laptops and tablets have worse performance on average than students who haven't. It is difficult for many students to focus on learning without being distracted by other entertainment [uncountable] online. Additionally, computers and tablets are much too expensive for many students that they cannot afford it. Eventually, it is quite often to lose the critical digital files if they were not saved. However, the crucial word of this argument is whether computers and tablets should 'completely' replace books in schools and universities. Since both learning methods have their conveniences and drawbacks, it is not reasonable to replace one with the other completely. Because the financial situation and preference differ among people, everyone should make his own choice concerning this question.

There are many aspects to consider when deciding which conditions would be more effective and reliable for employees who are working in offices. Among these are: the privacy and comfort, the specific activity or job that is being performed and the level of isolation the job requires. Firstly, it is undeniable that employees, as well as everyone else, need their own space with a comfortable and private atmosphere so they can feel less pressured. As a result, I think that an exceedingly open design might pose a challenge for most of them. On the other hand, what specific activity or job they are doing it's also a relevant point to consider. Whether they work on their own, individually, they are co-workers or they do these activities in groups, it must be kept in mind since it would undoubtedly affect the matter. Last but not least, the level of isolation that the job demands or that its required should be mentioned too since some jobs need a more peaceful and focused atmosphere, in this case, office, such as a writer, an accountant, a boss... while others might need merely a place to sit or a computer such as a secretary. In conclusion, to sum up, I differ from the idea of working in small, overwhelming spaces, although I do not go along with the opened design ideas either. I think that each job demands different conditions and the already mentioned points are the ones to take into consideration to decide that.

Zoos are a wonderful place for everybody to go to explore and to have more good experiences with their family. I think zoos also are a good place for people to learn about animals and learn about how the animals live in nature. I think everything has two sides, the good one and the bad one. On the good side that if we keep animals in zoos, children can see and learn about animals easily without any dangerous, zoos can be places for everyone wants to learn about animals, they can do it easily without any dangerous. Zoos also can be a place for children who love animals can see and touch them safely. Parents can take their children to the zoo with them to have more fun experience or to have more memorable memories with their children. In this opinion, we can see a zoo is a wonderful place for everybody, it is a place for everyone to come and have more fun experience and have more memorable memories with family. On the bad side that people have killed a lot of animals in zoos. That is so sad, very animals were killed because of money, and it is detroying our environment. whether it is good or not depend on how we do it .

I think study abroad or study in another country for a time during high school or university is an amazing and wonderful experience for students. Most people think it is a great advantage for students to approach their dream and their future, and most people think study abroad or studying in another country is the best way for students to reach the knowledge of the major that they are studying. And for me, it is also the best way to approach my dream. But everything has two sides, the good one and the bad one. On the good side that we can see studying in another country is the best way to approach our dream, it is also the best way to reach the knowledge of the major that we are studying. Studying in another country we can learn the language of that country and we also can learn the culture of that country too. Studying in another country we can be broadened in our horizons and understanding, we also can make more friends and can expand the relationship with people. In this opinion, we can see a lot of advantages that we can have if we study in another country. On the bad side that studying in another country is a hard thing that not everyone can force to study abroad because of the money it cost. And studying abroad can be risky, it is maybe wasting your time and your money. These are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad. Whether it is good or not depends on how we do it.

In 2017 a survey by the University of Oxford showed that 99% of the people questioned answered that they have lied before and that they felt ashamed about it. This research not only shows that lying is common, but also that doing so is connected to feeling guilty about it. In the following I will state my opinion on why not telling the truth is acceptable. To begin, as the survey mentioned above has shown, everybody lies, and it is normal amongst us human beings. Not telling the truth is common and should not be demonized. Furthermore, throughout the human history, lies have defined the development of our society and to give an example when the Polish King Vladimir did not tell the truth about having started a fight with Queen Elizabeth, he caused the separation of his country from England. In my opinion it is also vital to take the circumstances under which lies are told, into consideration. Since often the truth is not told for protecting either oneself or others, these people can't be blamed for trying to minimize harm. By telling the Nazis a lie about hiding Anne Frank and her family, Miep Goes saved all of their lives. This example shows that it is acceptable to withhold the truth for reasons for protection. Lastly, having lied to help another person, should be considered the best reason to legitimate lying. Although helping is a very important and honored trait in today's society, lying to do so is often considered negative. In my opinion these two things are intertwined. Lying for a friend who hasn't done their homework, is a great example to show that lying is okay. In conclusion, these arguments above support my opinion, which is that no telling the truth is acceptable.

In my opinion, everything should be digitalized in the future. In fact, carrying only a computer or a tablet with every book and every note it's much easier than carrying heavy books every day. Digitalized books also make you learning faster because you can easily switch from the book to the notes pad or underline or delete when you want. On the other hand, having a computer or a tablet could be useful to be connected with the internet. For example, with digitalized books you are able to search for a word whose meaning you didn't understand and you will be able to do research to increase your knowledge in an easy way. I think that in the future schools will be completely digitalized and also books will follow this path, making the school's world faster and smarter than it is nowadays.

Recently a lot of schols have been adapting new solutions in order to create possibilities for students to learn practical skills. Some of them allow pupils to do some voluntary work in time of classes. Is this a reasonable solution? It has became a subject which is discussed by newspapers and in TV programs. I will try to present reasons for and against in below essay. The main reason that support students volunteer work is that they can actually help in places where this kind of help is needed. I mean places like hospitals, shelters and hospices. There is always something more that could be done there. Each extra helping hand counts. Next reason is that student can gain extra experience by helping other people. I honestly believe that one can not learn such skills in school. In my opinion these skills may be very useful after graduation. Also, having volunteer work in your CV may be a factor that will decide about getting a job. Employers usually prefer candidates who have such experience. What about reasons against? I find a very few indeed. But, you can always say that students should not be forced to do volunteer job if they don't want to. I guess this supposed to be free decision of each person. Somebody who is forced is never a good worker. To summarize, in my opinion schools should allow students to help in hospitals, shelters etc. But, it always has to be a free decision of each pupil and his parents.

In my opinion, doing exercise every day is very good for our health. But everything has two sides, the good one and the bad one. On the good side that doing exercise every single day is very good for our health. Doing exercise can give us good health and mental alertness that can help us more concentration in our life, it also can give us a better life if we can do exercise every single day. Doing exercise every day can make us better at our job and our things. In this opinion, we can see the benefits of daily exercise are numerous.

In my vision, it is most effective to work in open space that have no walls to separate workers from their colleague. Some people say that they can concentrate on their job by working lonely. But, I think that it is not efficient for both themselves and their co-workers. I have two points about this. First of all, talking to each other while working is important more than working quietly. I do not mean that they can talk about anything like their hobbies without a job. I want to say that people working in open space are able to help one another. Then, helping each other with working leads to not only efficiency but also making relationships between them. So, it is the best way to work in open space. Secondly, workers can be eager to work by seeing their colleague working. If they work in separating room, they are possible to focus their job bu cannot see working of other workers. On the other hand, in open space, there are people working arduously wherever and whenever they see around them. So, individuals in office will want to work their co-workers and it generates multiplier effect. Lasatly, All in all, I described two points about my idea that it is better to work in open design office than in separating office. Recently, we can see many changes about how to working. Then, there is diversity to work in present society. So, we will have to adapt to working style in the future.

I attend the dance school. I have to study music at this school. We study theory of music, history of music and also to play the piano. I do not mind , but a lot of people do not like study these things. I think it is not necessary to study music hard in some other schools, because people do not need this knowledge for life. On the other hand, students have to study physics or chemistry and it is also not important for life. Why should people study physics or chemistry , not music? Many people cannot understand music, they cannot feel the rhythm, they cannot learn to play a musical instrument or they cannot sing. That is because they are not talented enough and these people usually do not like the music classes at school. But I still think that every student should have some elementary knowledge of music. It is not necessary to study to play the musical instrument but they should study a little bit of music theory or at least the history of this beautiful art.

I've already visited some zoos, one in Brazil and another in Germany but, I've concluded that zoos are not good places for animals. Because they are not in their habitat and holding them in a fenced place it's stressful. Once ago I've watched a movie called Blackfish on Netflix, which talked about an orc named Tillikum. It was captured from the ocean where it was living taking care of its group and being humans took it from there to cloister it in one of the most famous aquariums in the world, called Sea World, there it was taught to jump out of the water and to make funny tricks to entertain viewers however, in the backgrouds it was cloistered and stressed out. But humans did not take that into account, and one day during a presentation the orc freaked out and killed a presenter in front of public. That said, I believe that humans must live with animals in harmony as in the most higher level as possible.

Changing a teacher every year is not good for students because when students were comfortable to talk with their teacher, it's good for students and a teacher who wants to help and advice students. So if we change a teacher every year. Students have to start a relationship with a new teacher and it takes time for them. In contrast, if students have the same teacher for several years when they have problems. They will comfortable to talk with a teacher. I ever read an ariticle named "The Impact of Teacher-Student Interaction on Student Motivation and Achievement," it said the interaction between a teacher and students is an important thing. Otherwise, when the good relationship has been constructed, a teacher and students enjoy each other and the class, and feel more inspired to do well. In conclusion, the good relationship can improve social skill for a teacher and also students.

I see a request for articles in a magazine: We invite you to write about: The Future of Travel. I think I will write my article about this. The Future of Travel is an excellent question. Actually, I don't travel very much at least until now, I think I have only gone about almost eleven tours since I was born. So I think I don't have much experience about the future of travel but I am going to try my best to imagine the way that we travel in the future. Nowadays people usually travel over the world by planes, train and by boat, and that is the only way that people can travel to anywhere they want nowadays. I think in the future, we are still travelling by plane but on the modern plane that can go faster and safer than now. I also think in the future, we can travel by train but on the modern train that can go really fast. Travelling by trains and by planes in the future is really different from today, travelling in the future, can be faster. In the future we can travel over the world just take a few minutes.

Dear Katie, How are things? I've been to an amazing concert last week. I decided to go to the concert because it was organised in my neighbourhood, close to the park. The price was also quite low, so I was able to afford tickets. I didn't know the performing band before. They are called "Red Guitars." My mom said they were famous when she was young. Even though I usually listen to another type of music it was enjoyable. There was a little surprise for viewers - everyone got drinks and snacks. The staff was also really polite and gave us directions where to go. What about you? Have you been to a concert recently? Write back soon, Julie

The expansion of metropolitan cities has influenced several professional figures. Concerning medical doctors, who are the main topic of this brief essay, these are involved in this evolving phenomenon. In fact, most of them are moving into big cities, where the amount of patients and, more in general, people is larger than in the country. Of course, money is another important reason. As a result, the number of medical doctors has been strongly decreased in the rural areas, becoming an important issue which has to be fixed as soon as possible. Therefore, what would the solution be? We would try to answer this hard question. First of all, some procedures for the employment of new doctors should be modified. For instance, ten thousand young doctors are waiting for a job in Italy and, at the same time, some regions have not enough doctors. Hospitals must be renewed in order to be more efficient and safer than in the past, so that doctors can do their work properly. Because of the pandemic emergency, doctors and any medical figure represents an important resource for fighting this bad enemy, which is everywhere, not only in the big cities. Little towns, rural areas and poor people must not be left alone.

Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Jules Cool and I am writing this letter concerning the discussion about banning phones from public transport, shops and restaurants and wanted to let you know what my opinions are on this matter. I want to start with the aspect I am most concerned about, namingly banning phones from public transport. The devices are indeed necessary for the commuters, since they are being used to buy tickets and to inform themselves about delays. As I strongly believe that our transport system is one of the best in our country, I am worried people will stop using it when there are no phones allowed anymore. Furthermore, I disagree with the council wanting to ban cell phones from shops, because they are not only used to compare prices online, but also to pay for the goods. Therefore, phones are helpful devices when people want to go shopping and must not be prohibited in shops. In addition, I can't support these devices being banned from restaurants, because they are being used by people with disabilities. To elaborate on this, guests who suffer from allergies are dependent on being able to look up certain foods and allergens on the internet. Otherwise it could have very bad consequences. Equally, blind customers have to rely on apps and programmes on their cell phone to read the menu and therefore require their devices. In brief, I think banning cellphones from these public areas is not a good ideas. I hope you take my elaborations into consideration when deciding upon this matter. Yours faithfully, Jules Cool

I had used Write and Improve for my preparation for the STANAG exams. It was really useful for me, but it is not as good as practise with a real teacher. The problem is that the feedback is not specific enough. It had helped me to improve in spelling but I still have a problem with composition of the sentences. However it is for free and I can practise whenever I want and that is great. I think that I should recommend it to my colleagues at work, because they need to practise, too and they also do not have a real teacher as me. It is still much more useful than just some aplications you can download to your phone. The point is that it if nothing else it can help you to be able to learn proper words.

Video games is the same as movies, but the difference between video games and movies is the experience. I think video games give you more experience because you feel like it's you in the game. I'm totally agree with the children who play video games, but the children need to be taught by their parents. The parents shouldn't ban video games because it can cause the bad relationship between you and your children. The best way is trying to understand the children and if it's possible, the parents should play a video game with children. It can make your relationship stronger and better because the children will feel comfortable and happy with their parents who interested in the same thing. When you play a video game with them you can teach them about the behavior between in video game and real-life. In conclusion, the parents should allow their children to play video games and teach them about the difference between video games and real-life.

In my point of view I think that both could be a good way to learn English. In one hand if you have only one teacher for many years you can create bounds with him and he can see your weak points and focus on them, however if you are always with the same teacher and he always teach you the same way you can get bored or maybe his teaching method is not the most suitable for you. In the other hand if you have more than one teacher you can learn different learning methods because each teacher have different teaching methods and personal characteristics, besides it can be more interesting for you because every year you'll know new people. To sum up both have good things but if I had to pick one I would pick to have more than one teacher, because I think that it might be more fun and probably better for my learning.

Healthy living is the most popular topic in every year, people believe that it can help you live a longer life. If you read articles or healthy magazines, it's all about exercise, healthy eating, sleeping, and nutritious food. So we can't say that exercise is not the most important thing. Some people may have time for exercise, but not everyone can do that, especially, the working-age population. Working people are always busy and exhausted with their works, so it's difficult to organize their time for working and also exercise. On the other hand, there are also alternative options for being healthy such as healthy eating and getting enough sleep. It's simpler than exercise and everyone can do it. Although healthy eating is easier than exercise but some countries, healthy foods are more expensive than fast foods. To solve this problem, people can choose nutritious foods that can find in articles.

Online learning, is a system that is much more flexible and adapts to different ways of living. Thanks to being able to study online, it has greatly increased the different resources and materials available, as well as adapting to people's different schedules and lives. Now it is easier to find information about what you want to learn and you have less rigid schedules, being able to adapt. On the other hand, the individual's demands must be higher.

I would like to recommend to all of the readers website called "Write and Improve." I've been using this resource since September and definitely can say it's helping me a lot! Thanks to W&I, I improved my vocabulary and sense of grammar a lot. Writing is easy and enjoyable for everyone, so the idea of making it in another language and then seeing feedback and my progress is incredibly smart! I like how you can observe changes you make over months and even be told what language level you're currently at. I also enjoy the feedback I get every time - when I combine it with Grammarly, I start to see mistakes more clearly and - more importantly - understand what and why I did wrong! The only difficulties I had to face were with an online connection. It'd amazing if I could use this tool everywhere, no matter of a stable Internet connection. One of the last negative things I can think about is that you have to know basic English - both grammar and vocabulary. Of course, section "for beginners" is helpful, but it's all about writing without any clues except a topic. All and all, as I said earlier, I really recommend this site. I have seen changes in my grammar after a few days of everyday' usage. My friends seem satisfied too. I hope you will try it out!

Choosing where to live as a university student is an important decision to make. In my opinion, When university students have their own places, they can have many benefits compared to living with families. First, By living away from their families, those students learn to be independent and not rely on others' help. It pushes them to be serious and responsible since they now need to perform many things that they previously have not even thought about. For example, they need to find and evaluate a living space which is suitable for their situations. In addition, they need to do everyday tasks, such as buying groceries, regularly cleaning the place, etc. Second, Living on their own, students can have freedom and full control of their time. They could utilize their time for activities that enable them to achieve their goals. For instance, they might need to spend more time at night to study for a hard subject or find work opportunity to complement their studies. This is possible because they are free from their family responsibilities and schedules. In conclusion, when students live on their own, they learn to take care of their lives matters and focus their time and effort on things that interest them and provide a chance for rapid growth. When students at universities live independently, they put themselves on the road to success early on.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. This is a statement that my teacher asked me to write an essay about it. In my opinion, I think health is the most important thing in life. And of course, health is more important than wealth because if you don't have good health, you can't do anything well. We can earn money in different ways and we can earn money whenever we want but we can't earn health and, then we lose health, we can't do anything we want or need, so that is why to be healthy is important than to be rich. But you can see that there are a lot of people who are trying to earn money but they don't take care of their health and that is really bad. That is a serious problem nowadays, they just care about making money, but they don't take care of their health, and it is awful for them. When they get old, they can't have enough health then they have to spend the money that they tried to make when they were young to take care of their health in the hospital. It is really awful.

Nowadays we hear very often of how young people underestimate the importance of doing sports. Many do not understand or do not want to comprehend the fact that sitting in front of our computers is not the best activity to do all day long. We need to do some sort of physical activity in order to stay healthy. However, because if it, is it crucial to force student to do sport at least 3 times a week? Does everyone has to attend PE classes at their school and should we even have PE classes at school? In my opinion there are some exceptions, which we should take into consideration. Firstly, as I have already pointed out in the first paragraph, sports activities are valid in achieving healthy lifestyle. This is why I think every student, starting from the first grade of primary school and ending in the second grade of secoundary school, should have obligatory PE classes at school 3 or 2 times a week. The third graders should have the possibility to do sport at school but I think it should be an extra-curricular activity, since the third grade ends with an A levels and young people, who face this exam, must focus on studying. Another issue that I want to write about is that some students may do sports outside the school. In that case, school should take that fact into account because then, those students should be forced to exarcise at school. If they do enough of sports activities after lessons then why should they take PE classes at school? They only waste their time by doing that. Overall, I believe that sports activities are very important especially for young people, to avoid, for example, obesity. It is good that schools care about their students in that matter, however they should consider making PE classes not obligatory if a students does sports during their free time.

Dear friend, how is it going? I'm spending my free time watching movies and TV series. Regarding movies, I watched a movie which makes me get amazed. Its title is "Taxi Driver." Directed by Martin Scorsese, it talks about a man called Travis Buckle, who applies for a job as a taxi driver. We are in 70', the war in Vietnam has just concluded and remembered by Americans as an awful event. The isolation and madness are relevant in the protagonist's behaviour. He feels alone and he searches constantly a way to avoid it. But this will represent his self-destruction. In my opinion, the best scene of the whole film is the speech on the mirror. Travis is talking to the mirror, while he is preparing his guns to murder the most famous politician of the city. The evolution of his mind is the heart of the story. This is the reason why I love it. I stop here because I don't want to spoiler anything! I recommend it to you, and I believe you will appreciate it. Let me know what do you think about it. Love, Jerry.

Hello Jim, how are you? Some days ago, you sent me an email in which you asked me if I had gone to that music concert. Well, this is the reason why I'm writing this email. As you know, I went to the concert of my favourite rock band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, because my brother gave me a ticket for their concert as a gift. What an amazing experience! There were many people, crowded and attached to each other like sandwiches. But it seemed not to be important with respect to the band. They were fantastic, performing not only the last released album but also their greatest hits such as 'Callfornication', 'Give it away' and so on. The whole audience jumped with Flea the bassist and Anthony the frontman of the rock band. The concert lasted for about three hours and half. Time passed very fast! It seemed to have lasted just for some minutes. Actually, this was just the only drawback. Anyway, I'm going to see them again. The next time, you have to go with me! See you, lots of love Jack

The reasons are diverse for this reason, so then we will analyze some situation and factors which force to work the medical doctors in some cities instead of a rural areas. - Notoriety to work in famous Hospital: most of the important Hospitals are in big cities, for instamce Memorial Hospital is in NY City and you can get more reosurces to participate in some Research & Development projects. - Experience working on specific specialities: most of the medical doctors want to specialize in specific medical areas like Traumatology, Cardiology, Oncology and Hemathology.

Zoos are good places for adults and children to see animals. To build a relationship between humans and animals. Nowadays, people in the western world have no or less contact with animals. Because of the industralization and urbanisation there is no place or bad conditions for animals. People are used to go to the zoo and it is a part of their life. No one asks themselves why does animals have to be in a cage. And what about the animals, are they really happy to live in a cage. Animals cannot speak to us and they cannot not tell us their feelings. My opinion is animals do not belong in the city. You must not let the animals in town, but rather to put the humans to the wildness. The living space of the animals is not the town. Animals do not have to adapt to our city life. That is not natural. In value our system, we have to show consideration for animals. We must allow to ask ourselves if that thinking and acting fit with our values and imaginations.

Some people choose to learn by going to English Centers, the others choose to learn through the Internet.

And then, you can check again to see if the changes you did is good or not. But, nothing is perfect. This tool is not an exception. I have tried using for a week and sometimes, I got a problem with the error checking system. Sometimes, it didn't work well.

For example, it has a task that tells you to write about your experiences you got after helping at a pop concert. I don't think many people did that thing. In a nutshell, this tool has its pros and cons. The cons may make you confused sometimes but in general, this is a good tool for people who want to improve their Writing Skill.

It goes without saying that, living a long and successful life is a craving every individual has. However, when it comes to choosing between having a long but calm life and a shorter but more intense one, no doubt I would stand for the second option. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed as follows. To begin with, I would like to point out some of the reasons why I would undoubtedly choose having a shorter but more exciting life, instead of a long and calm one. If there is something remarkable about our mere existence, it will be nothing but the fact that we all have just one life. This certainty of having just one life makes it be the most valuable treasure one can possess because it is unique and genuine for every single person . We all are well aware of, at some point, our lives will get to an end. Perhaps, because of that statement I consider that, in terms of time, quality prevails over quantity, if we have under consideration that the more experiences you have, the higher sensation of happiness you will feel. At no circumstances should anyone regret any decision made which comes from our hearts. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned with regard to having a shorter existence. By living lesser, not only are you to miss the opportunity of witnessing how your children grow but also you are not going to be able to get to know how the future gets developed. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that no matter what your choice may be, the most pivotal thing is that you have to be who you want to be during your life whatever it may last because that way is how you will find the sense of belonging.

Dear town council, I am writing to you regarding the issue of banning mobile phones on public transport , in shops, and restaurants. Although mobile phones have a lot of disadvantages, such as social disintegration, awful effect on health, and trespassing others privacy by taking pictures of them or recording their voices without taking their permission. We need to consider that the phones are essential and connot be banned for several reasons. To begin with, phones are important to report any accident that may occur at public areas, like a car crash, a fire, a crime, and a severe health condition. In those situation, it is critical to contact the police or special forces to deal with the circumstances at once. Secondly, there are a lot of people that need to take calls at all times, like doctors, Salesmen, policemen, parents (in case their children need them), and in general everybody. Prohibiting people from receiving urgent can result either in people not going to shops and resterants, or causing protests to dwell in order to stop this ban. In addition,so many students use phones to listen to their recorded lectures or read a novel on their way to their destination on public transport. Preventing them from seizing their time and using it wisely will affect them badly. Finally, I believe that allowing mobile phones is the right decision for the comfort and safety of people. Sincerely, Batool

"Sitting on a chair, holding a book in my hands. I hear the rustling of leaves in the trees on a breezy night. Everything around me is calm as it used to be and as it going to be until I die" When imaginig this scenario, I pray to god not to let my days weary, and let me live enthusiastic, fierce, savage and delightful days that will render me in a thunderstorm of feelings and events, even if I had to pay a portion of my life in order to achieve that. How long we lived is determined by how much we accomblished, and the amount of knowledge we left to the generations that is going to follow us. If you asked me how much did Einstein, Disney and edison lived, I'll tell you that they've never died since their memory is going to live for ever. Such leading eminent figures have really lived their lives through every intense detail in it. Routine kills people, it makes them no better than animals that spend their lives doing the same things all over again. God granted humans with a brain to think, innovate, discover and change their lives to the better. For those reason I much prefer to live a whimsical life full of ups and downs, because thence I can consider myself alive.

As you can see, nowadays, more and more medical doctors want to work in cities, where they will make a lot of money, instead of rural areas. This leads to a phenomenon of lack of doctors in those places. So, what are the reasons for this problem? How can it be solved? This essay will examine the main reasons and suggest some resolutions to solve it. One of the main culprits resulting in this common trend is the fact that the salary and benefit packages in urban hospitals are more attractive than rural areas. People might have the tendency to choose a generously-paid job after working several years, medical doctors are not the exceptions. They would prefer to contribute to city hospitals, where the amount of patients is enormous, which means they could get a higher salary. Another factor adding to this issue would be related to the disparity in living standard between cities and rural areas. Being a doctor is a heavy profession, hence those working in this field desire for a deluxe lifestyle. They think they deserve to have it. So, how to solve this problem? There are some resolutions for this issue. One of them is that government should enhance the fringe benefits for doctors who are working in rural hospitals. In detail, bonuses could be rewarded for fresh graduated medical students if they chose to devote themselves to those institues. In addition, workforce distribution should be taken into consideration. This means not all the doctors graduating from medical schools can work in their favorable places. It depends on their skills. In a nutshell, there are 2 reasons has lead to the lack of medical doctors in the countryside: One, the disparity in living standard, salary, benefits between cities and rural areas. Two, the desire of having a deluxe lifestyle of them. If the government and individuals share collective responsiblities, it's possible to solve this problem.

It goes without saying that zoos have always been significant places where people get to know about animals, their habitats, and the way they live. In this writing, I am going to express my thoughts about that matter. To begin with, I am going to mention the positive aspects zoos possess. Had it not been for zoos, we would not have been able to contemplate some animal species in a short distance. I cannot deny that this is definitely one of the main reasons why some people would regard zoos as proper knowledge sources when it comes to understanding how animals live and behave. It actually is an interesting way to watch them and learn from them. Nevertheless, there are some negative aspects concerning zoos that should be underlined. Lately, it has been an increase in the number of people who claim zoos are not a fair method of analyzing animals because they attempt with their lives, and I am in favor of this thought. In that spirit, it is often argued that, in places like zoos, not only is freedom taken from animals but also they live in terrible conditions, and that is something we should not consent. Animals are taken away from their natural atmosphere, parted from their family members, and used as entertainment instead of being treated as the living creatures with feelings they truly are. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by adding that there truly is a more respectful way to enjoy animals, combining both, watching them face to face and respecting their lives, and this way is no other but going on safari. I know it is an option that not many people can afford but definitely is the correct one.

It's true that working area plays an important role to the workers, especially the ones working in an office. Open office and closed office, which is better? It's hard to answer. So, let's take a look at them. Firstly, open office. An open office is an environment where there are no enclosed office rooms or cubicles for employees. Usually, employees work in the same room, beside each other, while sitting along a huge desk or workstations positioned close together. Many workers prefer to this design because they can easily communicate with their own teammates or even different teams. It's more likely to establish relationships among each other. But, this design has some disadvantages. First, noise. You can't definitely avoid noise when working in an open area. If you and your teammates are working on a task that requires quiet to concentration, this design will make it a lot harder. Secondly, conflicts. When a group of people with different personalbilities and belief are crammed into a prison-like room to work for 8 hours a day, there is a high possibility of misunderstandings and conflicts. Finally, spreading illness. When someone is being sick with communicable disease, they can easily transfer and spread the virus to the rest of department. That's about an open office. How about a closed one, a traditional design one? With this design, workers have more safety, privacy and stability. Moreover, many workers tend to more concentrate on their work while sitting in an area surrounded by something. But, just like the open design, this one also has some disadvantages. Firstly, cost. A closed office is more expensive to build and maintain than an open one. Since each employee has his own workplace or cucible, you will need more area to fit every member of your team. Secondly, low supervision. Each employee has his own workplace, so it's hard to supervise what he is doing. Is he working or playing games? In a nutshell, each design has its own advantages and disadvantages. It's hard to say which one is better.

If you live in a big and vibrant city do you have to agree that it is not so difficult to find many facilities around you but if you live in or visit small towns and village you probably have lived some situations where is almost impossible to find some essentials facilities. Is completely dreadful when do you need some facilities and it is so rarely even more if we are talking about health needs. Health assistance can become a great problem when you are far from the big cities, so in some small cities it is implossible to find a doctor and even it exists you take days or months to make an appointment. One of the reason for this problem is because the doctors won't work in small cities they always prefer to work in medium or big cities so they can do more money in theses cities, besides if they work in small cities they have to get used living in quiet place and most of them cannot settle in small cities. This problem has no easy way to be solved because government cannot force the doctors to work in smalls cities so some other alternative need to be thought. The government of some countries offer many types of incentives to try to attract doctors to live and work in smalls cities. The government pay a really good salary, provide home and car and countless other types of perks for the doctors that are available to work in some far away cities. Although this great effort it is still many cities need doctors with desire to work there. Perhaps one alternative is the government give support for the local students because they achieve their medical graduation with the condition that they cannot leave their cities after graduated.

From my point of view, I think it is important to can speak a foreign language. In the past years I have noticed people chose as a foreign leanguage English, because it is the most used in the world and it is the easiest to learn. Firstly, Universities from Europe are teaching foreign students from Asian and African Continents in English and French, but if they will choose to stay in in the country they study is required for them to learn the Language which is spoken in that country. Secondly, is good to study the countries History and see what is the most attractive for you, then start and learn their language because you never know when you will have that feeling of changing your own country. Although people are burn in nice countries, they are rejected by their own leaders and forced to move by Coruption in foreign countries, in spite of leaving their families and their home land which has a big contribution in spiritual life. In conclusion, I would like to say that learning a foreign leanguage is important and required.

The School of the Future Have you ever given a thought to the matter concerning how the school of the future will be? It comes without saying that, every time we think of the future, technology has a significant role in it, and, needless to say, technology will play its part at schools in the future as much as in the rest of our daily routines. Distant though it may seem, the future is closer than ever, in the sense that in the recent years there has been a sharp increase in the usage of technological devices among the population, so have in schools. I cannot help but mention that when it comes to picturing the school of the future, I tend to imagine a robot taking the teacher's place and computer screens to achieve every task that should be done. Nevertheless, replacing a human teacher with a robot one would be a terrible mistake, from my humble opinion, due to the fact that human contact cannot be replaced by any gadgets. Each and every student has a different personality and distinct needs, and only a real person is capable of adapting the study method to every individual. In contrast, I find that the rest of technological devices that could be introduced in the school system would have a positive impact on the students' learning as their principal aim is to ease our lives and enable us to reduce the time we spend on school tasks. So next time you stop and wonder how the future will be, you should have under consideration that human beings will have to be part of it, and nothing will ever substitute real feelings whatsoever, not even at school.

Thank for recommending me write Write and Improve. I have found this tool to be quite useful. I will start my description from the positive aspects and then move on to the flaws. What I like the most about it, is level of advancement. It seems that developers thought about all English learners. There is variety of writing tasks for each level, which are related to everyday's situations. Another interesting feature is the progress graph. It provides a vital check of your improvement. However, feedback is the most confusing part. The sentences with errors are being highlited and you receive a short, written explanation. On the one hand, it is very detailed, as even the lack of coma highlights the whole sentence. On the other hand, the written explanation is useless, because you have to figure out for yourself what have you done wrong. I think that Write and Improve could do better. Then it would be superior to all other learning methods.

I believe it depends on the teacher and I will be happy to justify my answer. Learning is like a journey and the teacher is a students guide. As long as the teacher can take the student where he wants to go, it's fine. There is of course more to it. Aspect of integrity is important. For example, some teachers are only there for money, just doing their jobs. Whilst others are the true teachers, who cares about the student and his progress. Some of the teachers are also disorganised and inordinate. They seem to be lost in the lecture and often forget about time. It's like walking a long distance without taking a break. It can be exhaustive to students, and can cause them to lose enthusiasm. On the other hand, I meet teachers who are willing to go the extra mile. They have remained a students in a sense, are not afraid of questions, and are keen to investigate issues. These teachers I respect the most.

Nowadays people tend to present totally different taste in sleeping habits. Some prefer to sleep in a totally dark room with ears plug otherwise they couldn't fall asleep or even if they did they would for sure toss and turn all night long. Others more fortunate are able to sleep no matter the setting or sound. They even proved to drop off holding a smarphone or watching TV. Why is it so, that we differ from eatch other when it comes to sleeping? First of all something that considarably influences the way we bahave is the place of our origin as well as patters we have got accustomed to.

Both have their pros and cons then I think that a company should design its layout apropriately to its purpose. So what I mean is that a marketing department, for instance, should not be so enclosed or strict because of its purpose which is creation and come up creative ideas and when your are inside an enclosed place you feel enclosed which will not help them to achieve the department's purpose. Whereas an operational department will ask for a more strict layout because of its purpose. Another thing to take into account is how the workplace affects employees' mental health, it can seem an empty discussion but it's more important than we think. The longer you're in there the more affected you are. As I mentioned before some departments will need to be stricter than others however this doesn't mean that the place will be completely closed. Even though some departments ask for a more strict layout it's totally necessary to allow the sunlight to come in. This is important for people's vitamin D absorption which will prevent a large sum of illnesses. So in my opinion an open place to work is better than an enclosed one but it's important to consider the department's purpose at the same time to leverage the department's potential.

English is one of the most spoken languages in the world. I wonder whether there is someone who cannot speak at least an English word. It is impossible. Because of the globalization and the mixture of traditions and culture, in addition to a rising request of more and more language skills, English has become the basis. For what concerns my personal experience, I love using English. I am learning more and more the idiomatic expressions of this amazing language, with its culture and literature. From Byron to Blake, from Shakespeare to Milton, I read their masterpieces, trying to understand their thoughts and feelings. Of course, a language must be spoken: writing, listening and English grammar are surely important, but it is not enough. This is the reason why I am talking in English more and more, every day. One friend of mine is helping me to do that. Moreover, I am used to watch movies and TV series in this language, so that I can improve my listening and spelling skills. A foreign language is a "strange world," which is waiting to be discovered! I love English!

These days, some high schools consider volunteer work as a requirement for their students in order to graduate. Is that necessary or not? To my way of thinking, I think it's crucial. There are several reasons why I say that. Firstly, it is proved that volunteer work give pupils essential skills and practical experiences for their future lives. By doing volunteer work, pupils can get social knowledge and skills such as public speaking, fast reflective skills, interpersonal skills, etc. Life has different stages. Pupils should not only just focus the school life but also the social life. They should know how the world is going on outside school. Having expertise but lacking social knowledge, that's really bad for their future. Secondly, it also shows that pupils have the ability to contribute to their countries. Almost volunteer work is related to resovle unemployment, gender inequalities, crimes,... In addition, participating in those activities shows that pupils have concerned and had capabilities of giving solutions and improvements to bad social problems. Finally, social relationships. Participating in those activities helps pupils improve their social relationships, extend them. They can meet other people, make friends with them. That really helps them with their future lives. In a nutshell, volunteer work is crucial for pupils. " Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life. It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop," said Dr. Dorothy Height.

My personal opinioin is noise would have the way to deal with it. But we might not deal with brightness. The solution dealing with noise which I came up immediately is ear plugs. You can shut out of the noise only put ear plugs on. It is easy ! But about brightness, you cover yourself up with the blancket? Soon you will feel too warm to hide there. You will use Eye masks? No, I do not think it would be the best way, How do you know it is the morning if you are in the dark unless you take your eyemask away?

In my opinion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, maybe after reading a book or watch television on my cellphone. For me, sleep in a noisy or lightroom is an unpleasant experience. I don't like noise, include relaxing music or classical music, neither like light bright or small, because the light activates the ideas of my duties. In another observation, neither do I believe in using a mask or odors like incense, in this case, the incense makes me cough. I also don't think eating a lot before bedtime is a good idea to induce sleep it gives me nightmares. I noticed when I made exercise, I feel a little relaxed and it is made me much easier to induce asleep well. Finally, if a quiet and darkroom are not enough, drink a glass of milk always help me.

Dear Sir I hereby write this letter to address my concern about the ban on the use of mobile phones at various spots. I strongly disagree with your idea of forbidding phones on public transport. Usually, people use them as a form of entertainment while they travel from one place to another. The use of their mobiles enables them to see the time pass a little bit faster. A further point is, that there are a lot of people who, for instance, read the newspaper on the train, because it is the only moment in their tight schedule they have the time to do it. In the circumstances, I would be only too happy if mobile phones could be forbidden in restaurants and shops. I find it distressing, seeing a group of friends sitting around a table and only talking to their phones, instead of each other. Particularly noticeable is that we don't socialise enough anymore. However, even if I strongly believe, that there are some advantages of banning mobile phones in shops and restaurants, it would infringe everyone's privacy. Banning the use of cigarettes in restaurants was considerable, because it was harmful to your surroundings, whereas mobile phones don't cause health issues. I strongly recommend reconsidering the ban on mobile phones. I hope you consider my letter. Yours faithfully

It goes without saying that, telling the truth is commonly believed to be the best option whenever we are asked about anything. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed below. To begin with, I would like to point out the reasons why people who are in favour of telling the truth permanently give to support that idea. Needless to say, we contribute to our credibility by giving a neat and honest answer. People find it easier to trust us if we do not hide the information we possess and explain the facts that lead us to certain positions with regard to a topic. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned concerning telling the truth as it is the case of bad news. When it comes to giving information that could be harmful or delicate for a person, we ought to take into account the other person's feelings. For that reason, I consider that every now and then it is understandable to tell a lie instead. Particularly, when we talk about information rated as overwhelming. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that we should evaluate previously if the information we own is worth being given to the other person. If we cause a problem by telling the truth, then it would be preferable to keep that truth to yourself, otherwise, we would regret making a person unhappy.

My favourite season of the year is spring and I would like to explain my reason. First of all I will describe the way I see other seasons. Summer is great. There are long days and short night, is is warm and relaxing time. However you know that autumn is coming. The worst season of them all. Why the worst? Because I know that here comes the darkness. here comes long nights and short and cold days. Don't get me wrong I do not avoid suffer and I am glad that I am able to live outside of my comfort zone, but what is the best time in life? The best time isn't the suffering and it isn't the end of the suffering either. The best time is the last minute before comes the light. And that's why I love spring. Is symbolise end of the myssery and a new beginning.

Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently apprehended that the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants may soon be banned in our town. For that reason, I would like to give my opinion on that matter. From my perspective, the use of smartphones is inalienable and a pervasive part of our lives. Due to globalisation and the increasing importance of fast communication our society adapted to the use of smartphones. Nevertheless, there are cases in which smartphones are not necessarily needed to use: My impression is that the ban of smartphones in restaurants is legit and moreover a right measure. Moreover, I am convinced that the use of smartphone is a social barrier for two or more people that have met in a restaurant. I could obsereve by my own how plenty of friends were sitting on one table but talking to no one and gazing at their smartphones. I think that those cultural events shall stay cultural events by barring smartphones so that people are communicating in real live. Above that, the decision of banning smartphones on public transport is a superb one. I have no doubt that this measure should have been made a long time ago. By way of illustration, approximately ten thousand people are dying everey year in Britain due to distraction of smartphones. I would be pleased if my recommendations and opinion will be heard. Sincerely, Kamran Ghulam

Some students that got accepetd to college may be will decide to continue their edcational journey a way from their family. I think it's probably better for the students to live on their own that will teach responsibility. In addition, will help them to be independent and they will develop strong character. Being responsible is one of the goal that parents try to teach it for their children. Students that decide to live on their own will learn to rely on their selves as well as take a full responisibilty for their action. My sister was a very reckless person so we encouraged her to live on her own when she git accepted to the university. All of a sudden she became a different individual. She started to take control on her life and organized her time as well as her list to do. For that reason, my parents were massively proud and happy for her. As it had been mentioned before, going to the university may be a huge step in the individuals life. It will help in forming their characters and build their personality. I was a shy person that I always get nervous when talking to others. Since I was scared from trying different things I decided breaking my comfort zone by living a way from home. It was a hard decsion but when the time pass it get easier. I developed a great communicatoin skills as well as learn to be comfortable around others. to sum up everything that has been stated, living in your own while attending school will probably be more beneficial than living with your family from my percpective.

I wish I could live forever, never grow up, always have a good time. I wish my life never ended, but if I had to choose between a long, calm life or a shorter and more intense one, I would definitely pick the shorter one. One reason why I would do such a thing is my love for adrenaline. Ever since I was little, I was a fan of extreme things; I used to love rollercoasters and scary movies and I haven't changed at all. I see life as a video game where you're the hero and if you want to finish it, you have to pass some difficult levels. Another reason why I wouldn't choose the long life is my tendency to get bored with things very quickly. No matter how much I enjoy something, I always feel like I need to switch things up. A calm life could never be enough for me. I want something memorable; I want to experience love, heartbreak, loss, happiness, sadness; I want all the things that make us human. I understand why some people would prefer to live longer: more time with your loved ones, more time figuring things out and a lot of other things that take time. Even though I would want those things too, I can't imagine myself choosing a quiet and peaceful life. All in all, this isn't the first time I've spoken about this topic and after giving it much thought, I realised what's my choice. I want an intense life, even though it might be short.

I used to sleep in a dark and quiet room far from the noise street. But everything changed when my son born. We moved to the first room, which is bigger and more comfortable, that means that we usually listen to the noise from the street. Also, we adopted the habit of sleep with a small light because we used to get up many times for care of him when he was a baby. Nowadays we continue with the habits that we took some years ago. Nevertheless, I can sleep in darkness or with light, in a quiet or noise room, it doesn't matter.

One of the best ways to expand our horizons and our brain connections is travelling, it is a mix of new place, new food, new people and a new way to see the world. In the past trips were too long and people usually spent weeks or months in only one trips, nowadays we have spent hours during a trip, therefore I believe that time spent in trips will be shorter in the future even though we've invented a large number of transportation some more will be invented or they are being invented. On the other hand some things will never change, I would say that people interaction will always be essential for a great travel experience because we are humans and we need human contact. In a nutshell, the time spent in a trip will be shorter in the future however the necessity of human interaction will always be needed.

Nowadays, many schools require students to learn and play a musical instrument. Some people say it's not necessary, students don't need to learn it. The others say the opposite. To my way of thinking, I think music should be taught at school. Why? Music is a subject to help students relax after heavy studying hours. As you can see, students must learn many subjects at the same time. Math, Literature, Physical,... everything. The classes go on continuously. One class is finished, the next one is going to start in a few minutes or even immediately. It means that except the break time, students don't have much time to relax after finishing a class. Music will help them with that problem. In addition, the curriculum of this subject is not heavy. Students just need to know some basic knowledge such as some chords, notes, etc. They don't have to learn like they're going to take an entrance exam to a conservatory. Finally, music classes create an opportunity for detecting music talents at school. This contributes partly to development of the art of nation. For example, many historical stories in the world recorded famous musicians who educated from normal schools before. If there had not been musical classes at school, the world would not have had many famous musicians and singers. In a nutshell, music should be taught at school. It's not only help students relax but also create an opportunity to detect music talents.

The school of the future is an interesting subject to discuss together. I think the school in the future is really different from the present. I think school in the future is better than school in the present. But at any time everything still has a good side and a bad side. On the good side that I think the money for studying in school will be decreasing and will be cheaper than the school in the present, so everybody can study in the favorite school without worrying about money. The school facilities are going to improve very well, so the school can educate their student effectively. I also think in the future everyone will be able to learn online. that makes it easier for us to study in the future than study in the present. The conclusion is in the future everyone will be able to learn thing more effectively, easily and cheaper than study in a school in the present. On the bad side that the school in the future can be more expensive than school in the present. That is awful for our children and our future.

Televisions are devices used only to entertain and at least here in Brazil they are not used to educate which is really sad because TVs are powerful tools. I will tell you what you will see whether you turn on a TV in Brazi. First bad news, here television programs which talks about death, violence, robbery and other bad things have a big audience; second novelas which is something similar to series but it is a lot more boring and it is full of violence, discussion, death, robbery and bad things; third sexuality, this is something considerably acceptable in the country where I live in and you will see things related to sex fequently on TV. In conclusion, TVs can be used to educate but they are not. Who detains this kind of power use it to manipulate and to influence people's life and their political opinion.

Most people in the world say that they could not endure the lies and they always telling the truth. More than half of these people are lying in their daily lives. The way I see it does not hurt to tell little lies every now and then. Of course, I am totally against big lies, people should not tell lies which could affect other person's lives deeply. In the first place, if everyone was always telling the truth, it could hurt people. For example, if you ask a friend how it was after changing your hair, you would expect to hear a positive comment. Especially if this friend is not very close, you may not be prepared to hear a bad comment from her/him. In such cases, your acquaintances and friends generally do not want to offend you, so they do not hit the negative side of the situation in your face. Our close friends and family usually take on this role in our lives. Another major reason is that sometimes the occasions are not your business. So you lie when the interlocutor asks you something because you do not want to mingle in others' things. This behaviour is actually really great. I am concerned that when you mingle other people's situations, they may accuse you after they resolve the situation. In the end you could be the culpable and they go about their lives as if nothing had happened. All things considered, sometimes lying is necessary for the good of people. If you are not in a position to tell them the harsh truth in people's life, it is much better not to interfere in their affairs at all. In my opinion, it is a great mistake for people to lie to their immediate surroundings, other people are not that important.

A lot of people think that you don't need to learn English because they do not travel abroad. They even think that you can get everything translated so why bother with learning a new language. The opposite is the truth! First of all I would like to mention books. I agree that there are subtitles for more or less all of the movies and TV shows, however there is so many books which are not even sold in your country. My life is so much better because I can read all of these foreign books and there is infinit number of them. And aside of book, what about all of the podcasts.

We live in an age when many of us are more interested in get lots of money rather than taking care themselves and have a healthy life. However I don't totally agree with this way to live, if you're searching how to be happy, be rich is not the best option. In my opinion healthy is more important than be rich, why, because there is no point in having a lot of money if you're seriously sick, then you can enjoy that money. Furthermore, live gives us pleasures which you don't need to spend money and the other hand be rich only implicate to have a stressful live, in despite this, currently people are only interested in make-up much money, they work so hard and spend their lives tried to have lots of money. In conclusion, we should be focusing on taking care of our health. We need to learn that money does not buy happiness, true love and peace of mind.

Music and study music is a really interesting subject to discuss together. In my opinion, I think music is a really complicated and also the very subtle thing that people invented. I think music is the language of feelings, that language can touch our soul. Study music is not easy on the other hand is very difficult to good at music. So let me answer the question of do you have to learn an instrument that you mustn't learn an instrument but I encourage you to learn how to play an instrument you love. Then you will see that is an amazing thing you haven't done, I promise that you will not regret it. Learn how to play an instrument at a basic level maybe is a simple thing but if you want to be master at the instrument you are playing then it is a different story. To be master at the instrument you are playing is a really hard journey, it will not be easy at all. If you want to be master at the instrument you are playing, you have to practise playing it regularly for a long time but it is worth it. I think learning how to play an instrument is a good thing to do when you have free time and learn to play an instrument can teach you how to be patient, and it also teaches you a lot of things that it's very good for you and your life. Do you think music is the best way to touch someone's feelings? I think music is the language of feelings. When I listen to a piano piece I feel so peaceful and lightly, it makes me remember my childhoods, isn't it beautiful? I can't imagine what we would have been like without music.

Write and Improve is a really useful program. I like it very much. It evaluates my sentences, so I can see how my writing level is. Basically, it gives me all kinds of tasks, and then I write sentences based on them. Afterwards, the programme will evaluate my sentences respectively. If I made mistakes in my sentences, it will point it out for me. Thanks to this programme, I can easily practise my writing in English. Although there is no specific explanation about wrong of my sentence, I feel somewhat improvement of my writing. It would be better if I had a tutor for my writing. It's okay with this program for now. Anyway, I'm going to use this from now on, so I can improve my writing skill in English every day. I think the important thing is consistency. If we want to be fluent in English, we have to be persistent and consistent. More you write in English, better you write in English. I would recommend my classmates to try Write and Improve, absolutely.

I don't disagree about the fact that children playing video games. I believe there are pros and cons. Video games can help children develop many cognitive and physical abilities, such as motor coordination, critical thinking, self-control, ability to think fast and such. It is good because, currently, these abilities are becoming necessary for the next generations. Currently video games can be highly profitable. There are many competitions and the teams that will participate are composed of proof video game players. Therefore, if your children like playing video game you can show them this activity such a professional job. But there some cons too. Children need limit, they cannot play video games all day long. Children need to work on their others abilities, the called soft skills. Children need to learn how handle other person and how to solve problems. Children need to develop a sense of responsibility and video games cannot help that.

Many IT- experts claim that the school system of today is very out of time and had to be modificated even a long time ago. According specialists a modern school of tommorow could look like that: Instead of caring dozens of books a tablet will bring and end to the severe burdens of students. Every book and exercise will be contained in one thing. But there is even more. Writing on a blackboard is not necessary anymore since the writings of the teacher are directly sent to the student's devices. And why are we even talking about teachers? Today there are online platforms galore which provide thousands of students with video lessons and knowledge for free. There will be no teachers needed and marks will be determined by computer programs. It is very possible that schools will not exist in futue since everyone could learn at home. All in all it can be said that the school of tommorow is astonishing but not far away. In industrial countries this will soon happen.

The space where do work is one of the most important aspect that can help you to be more productive and criative. Thinking about it many companies around the world has been studying many different types of offices that could better fit for their employees. They have invested much money and time to find the balance between what is the best for the people who work for them so this can be good for the company because people that is working happy can produce more and better. Some of the giant companies like Facebook and Google are in the top of mind when we think about modern reltionship between Employer and employee. More than open concept oficces you will find there office which has no desk how we used to find in the past. The changes is not just about a fisic space it is much bigger. People who work for Google for example have no specific timetable to work they just need to do what they have to do, so that way they can do their own time to work. When we talk about how the way to work in offices have changed in the last few years it can cause some confusion or perhaps we have the impression that every company in the world had changed and every office is now open concept and you will have great flexibility to work in your own way. But it is not exactly true even you work in one of these companies that was told on the last pharagraf, problably you will hardly find some other companies that work using the same concept.

English language learners need to practise English on a daily basis. Therefore, they should find resources and tools to help them do so. One tool that could potentially help learners develop their writing skills is a service called Write and Improve. Although it has its limitations, I believe that this service will help the students write better. The website offers the student various writing prompts which are classified by students' writing abilities: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. These prompts are about many topics, such as education, art, technology, etc. In addition to the variety of topics, the website offers a variety of writing types, such as narrative, opinion, and argument. The students are guaranteed to find writing tasks that match their needs and interests. Moreover, the service provides feedback to the learners about every piece they write. After the student finishes writing the text according to the task instruction, they could submit it for evaluation, and after the evaluation, the student sees a score ranging from A1 to C2 and the sentences that could be improved highlighted using varying degrees of yellow. The darker the color, the more problems the sentence has. The students then use the feedback given to make changes and repeat the process until a sufficient quality has been achieved. Additionally, every evaluation is recorded in the system so that the user can see past task attempts and compare them to the most recent ones. Finally, I think Write and Improve is a very good service for those who are aiming to improve their written communication. The large number of tasks along with their diversity in topics and types ensure that there are always a suitable writing task for every writer. In addition, the feedback gives the writer guidance regarding where improvements could be made and an indication of their writing level. Nevertheless, the feedback is sometimes ambiguous and frustrating for some learners. For instance, erroneous sentences are highlighted, but no information about what the error is. Those who do not have full mastery of English grammar and mechanics will have difficulty determining possible ways to improve the sentences without relying on the help of teachers or other services. What's more, the feedback often is not accurate because it is fully automated using artificial intelligence. For example, it fails to mark basic spelling mistakes. Despite the issues mentioned, it is the best option available for students that do not have access to qualified teachers, and hopefully, it improves in the near future.

There are two types of accommodation which students have to choose when they go to university. The first one is to stay with their families and the second one is to move out of them and live independently. It's hard to say which is better because both of them have their pros and cons. But to my way of thinking, I prefer the second. Firstly, it helps them grow up. Moving out of family and living independently also mean that they have to do most things by themselves. For example, when they stay at home, their mothers make lunch, dinner for them. But when they live alone, they have to do it by themselves. They also learn how to spend money in a smart way. Secondly, they have a chance to relax and to be convenient to study and follow their educational life. If students live separately from their families, they will focus more on their studies and could get more achievements. On the contrary, living at home can lead to many bad results. Without the preparation for life's struggling, students can suffer from the deficiency of practical experiences. As I mentioned before, when they live indenpendently, they have to roll with the punches. But when they live at home, their families usually solve almost their problems. That results in a lack of experiences when they have to face with them alone. Of course, this way of living has some of its downsides as well. But, I believe it is still a better choice for students.

I think that having new teachers each year is better rather than having the same teacher for several years. The teachers have their own ways of teaching respectively, we cannot receive all techniques just from one teacher. So, I prefer to have a lot of teachers. But if I find my favourite teacher, I could possibly stick with that teacher. In any case, I have to take many lessons from many teachers. I don't think that having only one teacher is a bad idea. He or she would have more personal information about us. Because of it, they could teach us more suitable techniques. It is definitely a good thing. However, there is a limit that one person can teach their student. I assume it is inevitable. Having a lot of teachers could be better because it has more aspects of studies. We may find more suitable study methods for us. This is why I think that students benefit more from having new teachers each year.

We live in a world that is changing very fast. What was considered trendy a decade ago is now old-fashioned. Do we still need to learn foreign languages in times of artificial intelligence? Maybe we should just trust our robots to do this job? I will try to answer this question in below essay. Some of the futurologists claim that learning languages will become obsolete in the next few years. Tools like google translator keep improving and people who don't know English can easily communicate with English speakers. Future developments in this area are highly possible. A group of scientists have been working under a special chip which will be located in the brain. This chip will allow user to translate from all of the languages. However all this sounds promising, there are still some serious doubts. First of all, google translator is still not perfect. In the case of English it is effective, but not so much regarding other languages. Language brain chip initially will be very expensive and people will be afraid to use them. In my opinion, this kind of tool would not be commonly used before 2050.

In contemporary society we are told to always seek the truth. It does not matter how hurtful this truth may be - most of the people would advise you to never lie, even when it would make a situation better. Is this really apply for everyday life? Let's find out. I like to recall one specific example - you are a nurse helping with an old couple - one of them is on their deathbed, even though they are not really aware of it. What is the best to tell their significant other? They are already in pain and agony, why would you make the situation even worse? In this situation, and situations similar to described, I think the best decision is to tell partial truth. You shouldn't pull them down by saying there is no hope, but convincing everything will be fine wouldn't be ethical too. But what about other examples - because for sure there are a lot of circumstances when it would be the best to just tell the truth (such as cheating or playing truant). For me, rethinking everything can be really refreshing and helpful while making serious decisions. All things considered - the truth can be valuable and most of the times is, but you have to observe the whole situation and then calculate how much good for both sides there is.

The vast majority in the world thinks death is terrible. They are afraid of the post-death process and leaving their loved ones behind. They do not think it through but actually resisting death is an instinctive act. The way I see it, both sample have their own advantages and people's choice may change according to their personality. To begin with, short but intense life is perfect for people who just live in the moment and don't care or ambitious people. We can view this issue from different angles. From the ambitious part, we can say that a short but fulfill with achievements life is perfect for them. Such people do not have to live long, they will be the happiest in the world when they achieve their goals. If they live long and they cannot achieve anything after a while, they can be frustrated, devastated and angry. This kind of life will be torture for them and they can pull their loved ones into misery with themselves. At the other view, people who just live in the moment and don't care about the other things, they do not waste their lives with responsibilities, works or anything that would interfere with what they want. They just need to fulfill their daily needs and concurrently with have fun. Such people do not want to live long but calm, the majority of them do not want to get old. On the other hand, I think most people want to live long and calm. They want steady jobs, happy wedlock and above all they want peace. Such people know how to be happy with the little things and do not seek adventure in daily life. They prefer spending quiet days with loved ones and things and doing different things occasionally. All in all, I will not prefer both. The way I see it we should mix these two life styles. We must live our youth to the fullest and live a quiet life after a certain age. We have to go where our hearts take when we are young and be open to different things, try everything we can try. When we get older and our responsibilities increase, we must lead a quieter lifestyle. Of course, this does not mean leaving all our wishes behind, we should not give up from things that will make ourselves happy. This is my point of view at this subject. Everyone chooses lifestyle according to their character .

I would practice on the speaking website. And there was a teacher and I asked him to help about my writing skills. After that he wanted me to send some example of my writing. He said that I have a way to go for progress on my writing skill. That was the day I met with Write and Improve. Since then this website became my first choice for writing training. It is my favourite because of its features. I can set a timer and I don't think any topics. These are so helpful and they saves time for me. Because it takes so much time to find a topic. I believe that they do in order to new learners. Initially I didn't understand the checking system. It was colouring the lines yellow and it was rating my skills A1 to C2. Then I searched and found. It indicate that some problem could have been in that sentence. I was doing so much mistakes but thanks to this application I realized my mistakes and I decrease them.

Nowadays technology has advanced so fast, we are able to get a lot of information wherever we are and whenever we want. This easy access to the information has benefited to many students and schools. However, some people think this techonology will replace the traditional ways to learn. Firstly, students don't need to spend lots of time in the libraries or schools doesn't need to get lots of books to school population. You can obtain electronic books on the internet and check them by tablets, computers and even thought by celphones. Nevertheless, these kinds of devices won't replace traditional books, some reasons for this is the fact that not all electronic books have a good transcription, good books cost much money and others are not available in electronic format.

I've got to say that I really love books and I've got my own little library. I buy my books and I am not into reading kindle books. However on universities it is something different. Durning my university days it was necessary to have some books from our library althroug I rarely used them. I think that it is much more practical to have all the materials in the computer so you can find anything by quik search and you can copy the most important information and make your own tools for study. The problem is that you rarely need to study just one book. You have to switch between them and it is much faster on your computer screen. There are so much information that you have to process those days and everything is constantly changing. And that is other important aspect. You can actualise your online documents but you can't print all he books every time there is something new. Those are reasons why I believe that computers and tablets should replace books in schools or at least those books which contain frequently updated information.

Indeed, some video games can have a negative impact on children. But, in general, video games are not necessarily bad for children. There are a lot of educational games in the world, for example. Children may expand a lot of their vocabulary through playing video games. They could learn social skills in some cases. Moreover, playing video games are safe in terms of children's body. To play outside can be dangerous especially for children. Besides, I think that forbidding children playing video games can rather have a negative impact if the children want to play video games. They could feel a pressure because of that. Of course, playing video games all the time is bad for their health. There is a problem that children do not play outside nowadays. They should play outside sometimes so they can do some exercise. In conclusion, we should not forbid the children playing video games. The thing is, we should watch out for the video games what our children are playing. If the game is not suitable for our children, then we must tell our children not to play it. When it's not the case, we should let the children play freely.

This is a real problem that we have to solve. As a city person we can't close our eyes for rural areas. At the other hand we can't close our for doctors. Nobody has to work where they don't want. It is a two sided problem. Rural folk wants to get treated well and the doctors want good life standards. In my opinion that can't be solved between rural folk and the doctors. It issues government and health department. If the wages depend on where you work it has to be changed. Country has to be one body. From village to city centers. Some just don't want only the money. They want to wander around, visit some museum, go shopping. And they also want to feel safe when they walk. This all interest the government. If you want doctors to go where is the mission, you should provide them these standards. If you decided to do it, it will take time. That is for sure. One life could be wasted while you are developing the murals. So you have to assign enough doctors when you are in the process. This could be provided by incentive. If you say, I will give more money for mural doctors for a while, someone could utilize it. It could be a chance for new graduated students. And I wonder if the health department announce that they will assign new doctors to the murals, could it help for developing ? For instance, in my country if you work in the government, you have to work in the east part which is the murals for five years minimum. And if you provide good life standards, it becomes like a chance to save money especially for youngsters. I hope that every member of a country feel equal.

Hello everyone Today, I want to write about the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad, I will mention my opinion: Studying abroad has a lot of advantages as 1. People know other cultures and features about food, languages, buildings, nature, laws, clothes, weather, devices, drinks, money, animals, plants, history, etcetera. 2. People can travel to other cities nearby, because they can use buses, underground, cars, motorcycle, bikes or walk due to is no expensive and they can find tourist plans to go between cities. 3. People study and knowing the different levels of grade, if they search for a degree, it is good for them in your origen country. 4. People can study and learning other languages because they need to speak to other people. 5. People can enjoy the seasons, because many countries have no seasons. However, it is important mentions there is a big disadvantage, that is people generally are alone in a country so far away from their house, so they can feel sadness, afraid, discrimination, poverty, hungry, etcetera. In conclusión, I think about studying abroad is a big opportunity and it is necessary try it. Unfortunately, I cannot travel to another country, because I am poor and my family does not have money to pay my tickets and staying there. Now, I am thirty-four and having a good job, so I can think about travelling, but only holiday. I hope to do it, this year or very soon.

Dear Mr. Smith I am writing to you because of your last proposal. I am glad that you care and that you can identify the current problem. The proposal banning the use of mobile phones would prevent us against the "digital demention." In my opinion it is may be a little bit too radical. The mobile phones in the restaurants are destroying our culture and our ability to communicate with each other. We do not talk any more. Although we sit at one table it is like there is a mile long gap between us. On the other hand nothing is black and white. The pohnes protect customers from exaggerated prices. You can easily find recommendet price of a product and you can compare the price. And public transport is another area where it can be useful to use mobile phone. It is true that some people are disturbing and they act like selfish immature people with their loudspeakers blazing. But you can find important information about your trip on the internet and most importantly the trip can be so long and you can use that time or waste it. You can do both with your phone. You can work on it or you can read or at least play some music. But on the other hand you can waste that time on social medias and it is not desirable at all. I appreciate your work and I believe that you know what are you doing. Best regards Kuba

One of my favourite films is "Manhattan" by Woody Allen. I think this movie is well written, and the story is enthralling. Allen's sarcasm is at its best. You can find a love story, and a reflection upon friendship, but you find a picture of the 80s as well. The soundtracks is really great, and a very good example of this is in the movie's intro, when the images are perfectly synchronized with the "Rhapsody in Blue" by Gershwin. The movie is in black and white, and this is because the same main character said: New York City is a city in black and white. I agree completely with this.

Sports should play an important part in everyone's lives, but unfortunately, they don't. Physical activity keeps both the body and the mind healthy and positively impacts one's life. The negative effects of an inactive lifestyle should not be ignored because they affect more than we are led to believe. Besides the obvious effects, obesity and the health problems it causes, the lack of physical activity also affects the mind, leading to unhappiness and unproductivity. First of all, doing sports activities at least three times per week is enough to make a change in one's life. These activities would provide most benefits especially if they were between classes at school. Taking a physical activity break between chemistry and maths, for example, gives you a break from mental activities that require you to focus and give you some time to clear your mind and prepare for the next class. An active lifestyle leads to an active mind. This has also been proven by scientists. While working out, the body releases endorphins that trigger a positive feeling. So, there are no disadvantages of increasing students' and school children's physical activity. Second of all, it is vitally important to make everyone understand the dangers of an unhealthy lifestyle. The way we live our lives is the root of all of our problems. An inactive lifestyle will never allow anyone to become the best version of herself or himself and it might actually cause more serious problems, like depression or physical illnesses. Young people are most impressionable and that is why it is strongly recommended to teach students and school children about the importance of an active life as soon as possible. All things considered, there is no doubt that sports activities are as important as mental activities and they should be mandatory in school.

I agree with the people who believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. The knowledge of animals is very important to people. The people can respect animals more because of those knowledge. Moreover, animals in the zoo are not in so bad conditions. Usually, they are treated really carefully so that they do not feel stressed out. On the other hand, animals in nature are basically in very brutal conditions. Some animals cannot survive in such an environment. Thus, I think animals do not have to belong in nature and it is not necessarily wrong to keep them in zoos. The important thing is to respect those animals and nature, but not let them be free without thinking. We are the same as them in terms of living thing on the earth. Let us not ban zoos and let us keep them comfortable. And then, let people learn more about them.

I think that studying abroad is really great thing in the main. The students who go studying abroad could learn various things from it. For example, they could be independent because they have to live on their own. Not to mention, they have to speak in another language, so they could improve their language skills. Moreover, they could learn cultures of the country where they are studying in. They could even make friends in those countries. These experiences would be precious without doubt. However, I think that there are some problems. The cost for studying abroad would be very expensive. Some students could not afford to go and live abroad. They would have to borrow some money because of that. What is more, they would be able to suffer from loneliness. They could not meet their family and friends back in their country. I do not know if they could persevere it. In conclusion, I guess that to study in another country for a time during high school or university is a great idea. In spite of that there are some problems, the experience in another country outweighs the problembs. The experience in another country would certainly be lifelong treasure.

I believe that zoos could be good places to learn more about animals. However, the current model used to explore this business is not effective. There are few zoos that are good examples of how to conduct this business. The exploration of images and the visitation of animals are important for generation of profits, and these profits should be used to fund research that protects and preserves the animals. It is also necessary to study how to improve the methods of reproduction of theses animals in captivity. If these studies are effective, perharps the new animals can be introduced into safe areas, such as tropical forests or other natural areas. The main idea is try to recover and preserve these safe areas, so the animals could live in a free space. As a result of this effort and studies, peolpe could visit these safe areas and observe the animal in their natural habitat. Consequently, conservation would help scientists achieve the goal of preserving many animal species.

I believe that working with group makes me productive. I would say open design offices are more effective than the closed offices. But I also value research about human thinking styles. It must be a research about it. Because productivity is one of the most important thing in the business area. Productivity and efficiency are the key of the mass production. If we downgrade to a human, not machine, it would help us to create more comfortable zone. If human is not in the comfort zone, they can't think properly. If flexibility of thinking isn't provided, workers can't work with high efficiency. Professional worker doesn't want to work in these conditions. While you are losing your workers, you can also lose the time. And all we know that, time can't be taken back. If we value our workers, we can gain more than we gave. As I declared, I would create an open design office for more efficiency and for more comfortable zone. It came from the researchments that I read. It actually calls herd pyscology. We feed from what we eat. That's certain. And I believe that our readings, our listenings and our watchings shape our mind. If we see a group of hardworking people, we try hard for not being a black sheep in the herd. It actualizes subconsciously. But on the other hand, being a single white sheep in the herd also harrases us. So we should mission our workers properyl. We should warn the black sheep and at the same time we should appreciate white sheep. As a summary about my thoughts is that we should utilize academic resources about human thinking system. After that we should organize our office in suitable forms. Awards for hardworkers also could provide an example to be a good worker.

Obviously, to be healthy is more important than to be rich. However, in all countries and all societies richness helps to be healthy. It happens not only in countries like the US, without welfare state, but in countries like UK or UE members as well: who has a good job and a good wage they eat healthier and have better cures. If you have money you access to private and better structure. Furthermore if you pay well you have a faster and good service also in public health structures. And this is not a matter of corruption: health has a cost, and the public could not afford it as best as it can ever. Same problem is for healthy food: poor can buy cheap food, and cheap food is dangerous, unhealthy, fat, rich of preservatives and sugars. By contrast, rich people can buy organic and safer and healthy food, because this food is often very expensive.

Languages represents a form of communication among people. They take part of history and traditions of a country. We could not define us human unless languages existed. Learning to speak a foreign language is the bridge which links two or more populations. It is as important as speaking own language. However, there are some important differences with respect to the past. In fact, people were not used to travel as well as today. Basically, this is the reason why a person did not need to learn a foreign language. Moreover, schools did not hold a sufficient number of language lectures, so that people had not solid language skills. Thus, learning a foreign language was not an important matter in the past. Nowadays, a foreign language must be learned not only when we are going to travel abroad, but also when we are applying for a job. Indeed, more and more national and international companies are requiring proficient speaking skills of one foreign language at least. For instance, English and French are the most relevant languages. If you know more languages, you will have many more possibilities. This is the future!

Some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. Why do they do this choice ? I think that is easier to learn a new language. When the students go into a new country, they should learn the new language to understand the native students and courses in the university. But, this is more difficult to understand courses. And, be in a new country can be sad. In fact, sometimes, students can be lost! They don't know enough the new language.

Everyone has a favourite thing, since he was a child. A colour, an animal, a book, a season. In particular, the favourite season of the year is said to be the expression of our behaviour. In this article I am going to explain to you what my favourite season of the year is and why. It is winter. I love it because I like to listen to the blowing wind under the window, looking to the snowy land in the coldest days. It made me feel relaxed. It is very special for me: I have many happy memories of my childhood in that season. When I was a child, I used to go out with my younger sister to play with snow, rolling up to the snowy ground for example. The winter is very often associated to Christmas time, one of the best moments of the year. In fact, I love opening Christmas gifts with my sister and my parents, in the Christmas morning. What an exciting moment! I was looking forward to discovering what present I had received. I consider it is still the best period of the year.

I truly hope that each parent has a right to raise their children the way they find appropriate. However, feelings and believes are not only difficult to articulate, but also very individualistic. Therefore, looking at what data tells us is crucial. Like any other other tool, video games can be put to good or bad use. For example, if young children play a game designed for teenagers, it will harm his psyche. That's because games can evoke strong emotions, and providing them with a defenseless child is a bad idea. It can lead to anxiety or aggression in the long term. Another harmful way, is to allow our children to play whenever they like. If there are no restrictions in place, child will play for the whole day. And sometimes even the night. In contrast, educational games are very useful and desired. We play video games because they are fun, and if we can make learning fun, the success is inevitable. To summarise my short asnwer, I'm for a reasonable and controlled use of video games. Not only for educational purposes, but also for pleasure.

Zoos are a very good place to learn about animals. Imagine a family of six going to the jungle to see a gorilla, giraffe, or a lion. This task would be both logistically and financially challenging. And for most people it can only remain an unfulfilled desire. Zoos provide a taste of such experience at a lower cost and a greater convenience. Not to mention uparalleled level of security. You say that people believe that animals belong in nature and this is true. However, there are people who believe that animals can be kept in captivity with no harm done to them. So even say that it is better for them, becasue they don't have to struggle just to get by, as everything is provided for them. Including safety which is impossible in the wild. Yet again we are discussing people's believes. How we can actually decide who's believes are right, and who's are wrong?

I went to Paris, France ten years ago. It was the most interesting holiday to me. Before that time, I have never been abroad. I remember that I was very excited at the time. I love French culture, especially the art and cuisine. Also, I got on an airplane for the first time at that time. By the way, I went there with my family and friends. My friends were excited about the holiday as well. In Paris, firstly, I went to a hotel that I was staying during the holiday. The hotel was really beautiful, classy and magnificent. I was really exhausted right after arriving there because of the jet lag. On the next day, I went to Disneyland and really enjoyed myself in there. There were a lot of attractions. On another day, I went to the Louvre, the famous museum. I looked at many famous pictures and sculptures at the museum. Besides, I ate a number of delicious meals. I love French cuisine very much. Definitely, I never forget these precious time. I would love to visit France again. And this was the really important holiday that I went on.

I certainly think exercise is important for our health. It is a fact that is proven by scientific research. However, are there things that are more important? Yes, I guess that there are indeed more important things than exercise. For example, the food which we eat in everyday life is more important. There is a famous proverb, "You are what you eat." I think it is true. If you do not take sufficient nutrients, you are going to be sick. I assume people tend to have unhealthy food these days. For instance, they eat a lot of junk food. They should eat more healthy food. Another important thing for our health is a sleep. I believe that sleeping is underestimated by most people. But actually, it could be the most important thing for our health. We could get refleshed by enough sleep. It is also beneficial to our brain as well. If we feel stressed out, it would affects our health. But sleeping can get it out of our mind. We have to get more sleep absolutely. Although I have written as above, exercise is also important for our health without doubt. We have to think about them all.

Nowadays, it is true that many people are thinking that living a shorter life it's much more intense and they are going to live the rest of their live's with this sad way but I consider that living until 100 years old will brring many good things in human's lives and I can tell you how. On the one hand, the vast majority of people are trowing their time doing nothing just work and it doesn't exist any kind of pleasure in this. For example, they can risk their lives and the time will be shorter than for people who are living 100 years. On the other hand, it will have you in hysterics when you always hear: " I like my life like this, going to parties, watching movies all the time , exploring new places and meeting new people, so I'm living my best life" but from my humble opinion I can say that only God can gives us all the time we need. In addition to this and from my personal experience I can say that I prefer to choose the first choice: living a long, calm life until 100 years old (if God let us) because you can go from this life until you did all it was for your life and family's too. So keep it simple, healthy, braive and also be proud of you always!

I have realized that in this website you generally want me to say some certain declaring. I don't like it at all. If I am a not a capable person to analyse the topic I hesitate to say something absolute. But I have a other option too. If we come to the topic all we know that music affects our brain. It make it work our brains different parts. They say brain has muscles in it. So if we don't practise it could get lazy very easy. But on the other hand, forcing is not eligible thing to do. If I want to be an engineer, I may not want to learn something about music. I don't have to listen music either. School principals should decide it for their own students nature. If you ask my opinion, I would say if it is optional not like obligation, I would want it as an option. Actually I am an engineer student. I don't even need to know something about classical music but actually I would like know small things about it. It would help me in conversation with some people. It could help me outside of my major. But I value personal interaction with others. It could be supportive to maintain in conversation. Nobody can say music is a unnecessary thing. Some say it is nutrition of our soul. But I wouldn't support if it is an obligation. Students can't be forced for something they don't want to do. It could create some barrier for students. Rap,jazz,sound,hearing,piano,violin,guitar are good.

Favorite film is an interesting topic to discuss together. In my opinion, there are a lot of movies in over the world, so it is very difficult to tell you what is my favorite film. I think I don't have a favorite film because I think I can't choose what is movie that I like the most. I have watched a lot of movies since I was born, and I think maybe the cartoon genre is my favorite. The reason why the cartoon genre is my favorite movie is that I have watched cartoons since I was a kid and it makes me remember my childhood.

It is always an adventure to travel to another country. Studying abroad is especially relevant, because you get to stay in one place for longer. That gives you the opportunity not only to taste, but also to know local people and their culture. Furthermore, you make friends while studying. And some friendships are very precious, and may last for years. And there is also a chance for a romance, and meybe something even more serious. Another benefit of studying abroad is learning the language. Studying abroad gives students firsthand experience, not available during the lessons with a teacher. When you are exposed to language most of the time, you learn the best. On the other hand, you will far away from your home. That means not seeing your family and friends for an extended period of time. That may be even harder if you leave your boyfriend or girlfriend behind. New environment and culture may not be to your liking as well. There may be these little things that you'll miss. Like standing in the queue, hugging and kissing your colleagues, or even the products you might not be able to buy abroad.

Schools in new reality Is it only me or you have had the same complaints about your school? Imagining the future of school takes place on every level. We used to dream of more colorful buildings, better teachers, less homework, diversity in subjects. Now it's coming true. School has been getting closer to the futuristic vision of it. For instance, the first difference will be the use of technology. Tablets, computers and robots will not be only used by teachers but mainly by students. Paper notebooks will be long gone to trash. Another point is creating a smaller classes. Psychological studies showed that human is not able to stay focused in the group of 30 people. Taking it into consideration, schools will be reducing the number of students in a group. In addition, societies will realize how great role, nature plays in our life. Classes will be organised outdoors in order to show children the beauty of the world. Though, there will be definitely no changes in grouping kids by age. Governments like it. It is easier to control people. Teacher probably will stay as a head of class.

Dear Members of the town council, I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with your idea of making restrictions connected with mobile phones and their usage in public places. First and foremost, you do not specifically have any reasons for these regulations. As much as I am informed, there has not been a single problem with individuals using their mobile phones outside. It does not bother anybody in particular or cause any major conflicts. You also claimed in your previous press-conferences that you will not implement any restrictive measures that would significantly limit the freedom of your citizens. Last but not least, I decided to carry out an online survey on my website to find out what citizens think. Following the survey among the citizens of this town carried out online, 90 percent of teenagers showed a full disagreement with the idea of not being able to use mobile phones in public. About 75 percent of adults think that it is not necessarily needed and it would only cause arguments and chaos. When it comes to seniors, only 25 percent answered that they are against the idea as they usually do not use mobile phones much and do not care much. As it was shown in the survey, not only me but a majority of citizens do not agree with banning mobile phones in public. I hope this matter receives your immediate attention. Yours sincerely, Dana

In this new school year I want to improve my English skills and I would like to achieve some goals. About these goals, I will list it in the following lines.

I need to make some effort do improve my ability to talk more flently with other people, I mean, sometimes when I am talking I have to stop and think about what I will say, and it does not sound natural, or like a native English speaker. To achieve my goals I plan to read more news from relevant newspapers, listen to podcasts in English and radio broadcasts, and watch TV series with English subtitles. I believe that talking to native English speakers can also help.

We are now living in global and international world. In the past, travelling was a more difficult thing. But now, we can travel almost any other countries wherever we want to go to. This is definitely fantastic. Then, what about to travel in the future? I think that it is going to be easier and more affordable. We might not even need passports. There could not be any borders in the future. I fancy that it would be great for everyone in the world. It would help us all in many ways, too. For example, we could easily meet our family and friends in other countries. Let's see public transport. There would probably be by far faster ones. I guess that there could be space rockets in the future. We could go to the moon at that time. There is definitely no border, no country. We are all just humankind. Travelling is just travelling. Despite that I have written as above, I actually suppose that there is no difference in the future of travel. Dreams are just dreams. We have to live in more realistic ways.

Hello everyone. Here, today, I am thinking about how can the ways be of travelling in future. Well, let's begin: First, I should mention, I am 34 years old and all my life I have been in Colombia, an underdeveloped country, where all people only take the bus, car, plain, bike, motorcycle and boat. It is dependent on the place where they live and their economic situation. For example, in Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, the most people take the bus and transmilenio (it is an articulated bus, it works with some special conditions, this permits a faster movement inside city, but it is more expensive). Other people take cars and motorcycles, and finally there are people take bikes to go to work. The government says, it is important make other way to travel inside city, the project is to make a line train that crosses all city. This proposal no have good reception in population, because we think is a bad project, where the government is going to spend a lot of money and the city will not be better, otherwise, this brings more social problems as unsafe, dirty, structural problems in the buildings, extra costs, etcetera. In conclusion, I think about the future of travelling in my city is not going to have other ways of transport, because infrastructure is pretty deficient.

I will work earnestly to achieve my objectives, because amelioration of speaking and writing skills is my priority. Furthermore, I'm going to sequester a specific amount of time a day to learn and study under your gracious supervision. You know that I'm a downright person, and I believe that what I have just written encapsulates my desires and observations.

Books are instruments of learning and have a lot of knowledge. You can touch books and feel their texture. On the one hand, I think books are very necessary in schools and universities. They are the essence of education. When I was a child I preferred to read physical books rather than ibooks, computers or tablets. I was born in the age of technology but I prefer to read in a book rather than with a computer. On the other hand, I think computers and tablets have helped society. Each minute we learn more education with computers. Children learn better with computers because they learn visually. They learn by watching videos, singing and doing exercises on platforms. Young adults in the university search for information on computers rather than in books. They take notes on computers and tablets. I think it is faster than writing by hand. In conclusion, I think computers and tablets are very necessary for society but the books never must disappear.

In addition, the tenology 4.0 is developed and customers will book, set up, pay... from manual way to high-technology solutions. Many things combines marketing, storage, booking,... will managed by digital. Everything will solved quickly and immediately.

I see that serving now is ok for the visitors.

How do I like to sleep? It is a difficult question, because it depends on occasion. Firstly, I like to travel. I sleep in hotels, motels and private houses. For me after all day, priority is silent and I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room. But, if I choose a multiple person room, when I want to spare some money, it isn't possible, because everyone likes going to sleep for another time. Secondly, I'm a teacher and twice a year I organize trips for my students. We are together for four or five days and we sleep in a youth hostel. Then I haven't slept in a dark and quiet room but only in a small light room. Thirdly, in my own house I definitely prefer dark, quiet rooms, without light at night. Then I sleep fast and I'm sleeping from seven to eight hours. Additionally, the window in my bedroom has a view on the street. Sometimes my neighbours turn on the lights and wake me up, so I must have bought window blinds. Conclusion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room, it is healthier for me and I can rest after all day. But it depends on occasion, what I showed on the free example.

I think it's important to learn English. I have reasons why it is important to me 1) When I'm older I'm going on holidays to other countries and most of the countries speak English. 2) The language is fascinating and easy to learn. 3) I have to learn it because my parents can't speak English and I see how hard that is when we go on holiday to other countries. 4) England is really nice!

I think zoos are good to see the animlas. Of course it isn't so nice for the animales when they have to live in small enclosures. You can learn a lot in a zoo. For example how the animals look or how they behave. Moreover you can see for a little money a lot of different animales. When there were no zoo, you had to travel to various countries to see the animals. The wouldn't be goob for your ecological footprint. In addition the zoo is very nice for kids. They like to see the different animals. I think it would be the best, if the animals had large enclosure and their normal contitions to live. Moreover it is important that someone who knows the animals, care about them. So it would be better for the animals. I think for school classes, which are learning something about exotic animals, it is very good to see the animals in real life. I know it is something different the in the open wilderness, but it is a good compromise.

Dear Anton, Thank you for your last email. Nice to hear from you that you liked cooking and tasted new meals. What is your favourite new food? Could you write to me any recipes, please? I will experience cooking new meals and maybe in the future I will stay a cook? Who knows! For me absolutely number one is Italian food. I love pasta, with various sauces. Every weekend I prepare dinner for my family, and pasta is their favourite meal. I like to bake pizza, especially with tomatoes, mushromes, sausages, cucumber and additionally much cheese. Once a month I like to eat out of town with my friends and we are going to an Italian restaurant. But I prefer to eat at home, I like to talk with my family, friends and taste my and my mum's recipes. We eat together on Friday evening and often on Saturday midday, rare within a week when we must work. I like Italian food for three reasons. First, Italian food is healthy and delicious, cooks use some vegetables. Second, I like to travel to Italy, so if I can't fly and smell pasta and pizza in Rome, Milan or Venice I try to eat Italian food at home or at the restaurant. Third, Italian food has enormous power, integrates people, encourages conversation and works relaxing. Moreover, Anton, did you know someone who did not like Italian food? I don't think so. I can't wait for your response, Anton. Maybe one day you will visit me in Poland and taste my meals? I invite you whenever you want! Yours faithfully, Kristina.

Schools are set to educate the students. Traditionally, there are teachers and students in school. They must go to school almost every day until they graduate or move to another school. They must get up in the morning in most cases. Some students have their lunch at school. Others have their lunch at elsewhere. They ought not to go home until after-school. Almost every person in the world experienced such stuff. I always doubt whether or not the students should go to school physically. I think schools' duty is to teach their students itself. They do not have to attend schools really as long as they study what their school teaches them. Moreover, there are online study courses everywhere on the internet nowadays. I assume students in the world do not have to go to school unless they study at somewhere else. Students could study without schools and that would be enough. In those ways, they do not have to spend a waste of time, too. I would not like you to get me wrong. There are certainly some advantages that schools exist physically. However, it is not necessary.

I think television could educate people in general. In fact, there are a lot of educational television programme in many countries. Of course, we would be able to learn many things from books or something else. However, television is able to give us things in action on the screen. For example, we would be able to watch various wild animals on such television programmes. Their life, food, shape and so forth. Although it is only on the screen, it is very important that something is moving in reality. Sound is also important, because we can watch various things with the sounds. Although It is not necessarily television programme that is educational. For instance, there are a number of educational videos on the internet. The thing is, television is a thing which lives in our everyday life. Because it is everywhere in our life. We can watch something we did not know until we see it. I think that it is really fun. And sometimes, we can discover something educational and interesting on television. This is why I would say that television cannot only entertain us, but can also educate us.

Hi Peter, I’m writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things. But first of all, let me tell you that I hope you and your family are doing good. To begin with, I would like you to know that I don't have a favourite film but if I were to choose one, I would go for "Beauty and the beast" without doubt whatsoever. With regard to my decision of that specific film, I also wanted you to be informed that I love it because of its message, which is that beauty is found within. Besides, I consider that there is a quite good mix of adventure and fantasy in the film. The plot of the story is about a prince, who was selfish and unkind, and lived in a beautiful castle. One day, an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle, seeking shelter from the bitter storm. Nevertheless, the prince turned the old woman away, who was an enchantress. Because of that, she transformed him into a hideous beast. The spell would be broken if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal from an enchanted rose fell. Last but not least, I would like to mention that I strongly recommend you to watch it because it is a powerful classic story which never gets old. Let me know your opinion about it. I’m looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

Learning to speak a foreign language today is more important than ever. Speaking a foreign language is important because we can access to a lot of information from abroad, we can contact foreign people, we travel abroad more than in the past. English is the main language we have to study because it dominates the world of work, affairs, communication. However Chinese and Spanish and Arabic are important too.

There are studies that confirm that learning a foreign language preserves young and health the mind.

We have only one health and therefore we have to keep its healthy. I think that more important than exercise is health life style. For example, less stress, more vegetables and fruit and more breaks during work. We would have more alive and more enthusiasm. The key for happy life is doing more activities, not only one. I had played squash, unfortunately my knee was hurt. Now I am trying to do a lot of activities. Our mind is half of success. I am going to plan a new life-style balance, because it is very important for us. Some fruit and vegetables for breakfast, lunch and dinner is normal in this time. I do not know anyone who do not eat these things. In the Czech republic we have tried some spot in TV for health life and I thought it was good for citizens, but many people have not seen them. All of us want to be healthy and have a good body.

My best holiday I have ever went to, was a summer trip to Goplo lake. As long as I remember, it was a summer 1998. We were just before our 18th birthday, which in Poland marks your age of achieving adulthood, at least in a legal sense. We went to my friend's plot located just by a beautiful lake. He only had a little shed over there, therefore, we had to bring tents and other camping equipment. Some of us have got there by a car and others have ridden on bikes. I remember that my little Fiat was quite a sensation over there. We wrote funny sentences, and decorated it with empty bottles. We used it to drive to the local village to buy some bread a canned meat. We eat cheap to have more money to spend on the alcohol. During the day, we spent most of our time on the lake shore. We were swimming, sun-bathing, playing cards, drinking, and having all of the fun. The best part of it all was to be there without any worries. When you are a tennager, your only worry is to have something to drink.

There is a lot to say about working. It his the most important thing to do, because it allows you to survive on this world. If we have to work to survive we need to be together. Personally if I have to decide in which way workers should work, I definitely choose to let them work with their co-workers. Sure it could be a dangerous move because you are allowing your employees to talk to each other and it is not good at all. On the other hand you are giving them a nice way to work. Being closed in a cubicles could make an employee feeling bad or in an extreme case depressed with its job. The size of an office can really make a difference, just image an employee works in a small office. Surely he would feel sad, or feeling closed in a cage like an animal, and we know that someone who grows in captivity does not makes its job nicely, but if you let people having touch among them could be a good compromise, workers can help each other when they need it. In conclusion, to be a good chief you have to help your team with their job.

In this essay I am going to talk about music in schools and why it is a good subject to study. First of all, music is something that I think everyone should undertands. It can give you too many feeling, there are different songs, one for every mood. I have always been jealous of the schools which owns music classes. I really liked music since I was young, it can make you free, happy or makes you feeling stronger. Of course it could be difficult to undertsand how to play an instrument, but when you succeceed in something you are so pride of yourself. For example after nineteen years I decided to play the guitar, I am at the beginning of this journey so I still have much to learn. It is hard because I am studying it on myself. I think that Italian schools should add music as a subject, because there are so many teenagers that would like to play some instrument, but they can not. I strongly recommend to add in every school a music class, it will help students to avoid problems related to school, homework and exams. As I said before it can make you free and go away with your mind.

Zoo good for people to see animals in their country, maybe if there aren't zoos children and whole people couldn't see animals in their whole life.

My best holiday ever was ten years ago when I visited an exhibition about archeology. This exhibition happened in my city. The visit to the exhibition was important because I could see evidences that dinosaurs had been living near my house thousands of years ago. I could see a couple of archeological sites with many digings and in one of these digs there were a few bones from dinos, these bones can be named fossils and it is important to describe how the dinos were extinted or which was their nutrition-base or even if these animals had some disease. This holiday was important to me because I could spend time with friends a relatives that I haven't seen in a long time. They were living in other State far away from here, but they came to visit the exposition. So, in summary, that day was great, my friends, relatives and I had an excellent and funny day.

What can be more important than exercise? One needs energy to be able to run, jump, or do yoga. Therefore, there are at least two more valuable components to our health: food and sleep. In 2017 the Noble prize in medicine has been granted to a team led by professor Rosbach for the research on circadian rhythm. Their discoveries focus on the sleep wake cycle which is implanted in our cells. The research denotes that our bodies function better when we adhere to these patterns. Furthermore, it revealed that each and every organ of our body function according to a slightly different pattern. Therefore, it's not only important that we go to bed at a certain time, but also that we eat at a certain time. Generally speaking, people who sleep well tend to be more relaxed and less spiteful. By the same token, sufficient amount of sleep precludes immoderate need for coffee. Then there is the exercise; the third component of circadian rhythm. To be heatlhy means to feel tired in the evening and refreshed in the morning. Therefore, we should exercise at least 30 minutes a day to avert the effects of our sedentary life style.

Hello everyone. I have the opportunity write about the schools of the future, it is a complex topic because it has many view points. Well, it is time to give my opinion. Let's begin: 1. It is necessary has in mind that I am from Colombia, an underdeveloped country totally, sadly it is a country with many economic problems, where the most people are poor or extremely poor. The children face a lot of difficulties to go the schools, while the other part of population cannot go to schools and the minority can go to school without any issue. 2. The pandemic has been the reason change. Now, the children take their classes in their house, they use the virtual way to study, but you should think if they are poor many does not have a computer, wifi, desk or elements to study. The government of Colombia wants to implement the class virtual, but the question is what are going to happen the children? In conclusion, I think the schools should keep your essence, they are places to study, share, learn, teach, play, but it is possible in the future these places give us some virtual classes, relationships with schools the other countries, improving the vision of the world. But, if this improvement means more money children of Colombia cannot go to school getting worse your possibilities of better your life and your economic conditions. Colombia needs a total change where the resources will be to invest in the population in business, education, ways, farming, etcetera.

Phuc Tan Phu District Nguyen Son Street Las Noches City March 3rd, 2021 Dear Town Council, My name is Phuc. I heard that you are thinking about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Allow me to demonstrate my viewpoint about this. First of all, I don't think this is a good idea. The ban on mobile phone use can be disproved by many citizens, who find it very convenient and essential in their daily life. Mobile phones make it easier to communicate, find information, to contact with people. Basically, they are essential tools in a vast and dynamic society these days. The prohibition on using them shouldn't be implemented. This can result in many problems. On the contrary, there is a serious problem when people freely use mobile phones: noise. There is a variety of complaints about this problem. Many people use their mobile phones with high volume in publicity. However, as I mentioned before, the banning on mobile phone use can result in many problems. So, to prohibit this issue, instead of banning them to use mobile phones, the town authorities should impose some laws and and rules. This may reduce the amount of noise in publicity and won't cause much discomfort for surrounding people. In conclusion, banning mobile phones use in publicity is not a good idea. Instead, it can be controlled by imposing some laws and rules. Sincerely, Phuc

Yes, there are very good questions. I think animals belong to nature. It does not matter whether nature is in the forest or another place in town. A lot of kinds of animals live in their hometown or area. Zoos are places where they take care about them, for example very kindly, politely or mother carefully. I have very often gone to ZOOs in Prague, where I live, but now I do not have too spare time for it. Many kinds of animals are only in ZOO. There are not in nature areas. It is very important for future generations. I hope animals are satisfied there. I have supported them and I will support them again. Therefore I can´t agree with opinions that animals in ZOOs are as in prison. Eachone likes animals and animals give us many reasons to support them. Is it nice place in the town.

Hi, John! How are you! I hope this email finds you well and sound. Last week, I went to a music concert held in the magnificent musical hall of Suzhou. I have been expecting this concert for a long time, and I even booked ticket three months in advance. The primary reason I choose this particular concert is because Lang Lang, an internationally renowned pianist, would perform in the concert. I got to know Lang Lang when I was just six. You probably know that I have been playing piano for 10 years, and the key motive for my persistence is because of Lang Lang, my spiritual tutor. The concert was very well organized. Lang Lang played at least 10 pieces of masterpiece on the stage. You can't imagine that all audiences stood up and applauded for Lang Lang after each piano piece. Nobody went out for break during the concert. Lang Lang was so polite that he went back to the stage for three times after the final piece, and he played two more pieces to return his thankfulness. I had a wonderful night that day, and my interest in piano has been sparkled once more; therefore, I cannot help writing to you, and I wish to share my happiness and excitement with you. Best wishes, Michael.

Hello everyone. Today, I have the opportunity to write about my opinion the Television can educate. Now, it is time for writing, let's begin: Television is a device extremely useful or harmful, is dependent the person who is using it, because if the person is disciplined, is interested in knowledge, watching educational programs, take advantage of cultural programs. These actions permit people to be educated. Otherwise, if the person is not disciplined, is not interested in knowledge, is watching movies, series, novels, comedies and other entertain programs, it means, no take advantage of your time, this person not be educated. I think, television is useful so much or is harmful so much as the same Internet. Clever people learn languages, do courses, download programs, exchange knowledge with other people, other cultures, other countries. While fool people misspend their time only see jokes, memes, spam information, they do not want to learn anything, their interest is nothing, upset the world. It is outnumber lazy people that not take advantage of the useful things. It is the difference with people that effort themselves and being success. I think, I am a clever person, because I try to take advantage of my recursives as television, internet, books, information. For example, I try to learn English use Cambridge for you, it is on the Internet, I listen to English with movies, series, programs. I like to watch programs of criminals.

As I see it, is more important these days rather than in the past, owing that today we have a more globalized world where you can fly and do tourism or live anywhere and besides we're communicated throughout the world by internet, therefore each day we can speak with people from other countries and learn from them. Right now the most international language is English, hence I believe in the present moment it is very important to learn it. Nevertheless, it is true that in the past it was harder to acquire a new idiom due to the lack of opotions they had to study. For instance they didn't have all the apps, courses, language schools and so on, that we currently have. To summarize, from my point of view today it's more important for the reason that we are living in a more gloablized world where we can speak with people from other countries each day, although learning a new language has been always very useful and interesting and I recommend everyone to do it.

It is true that we're all taught to always tell the truth. But, in fact, sometimes we do not follow that lesson. We do the opposite but the interesting thing is it's somehow accepted. So, did our teachers teach us wrongly? No, they didn't. Being honest is important. That's not erroneous at all. But, in some circumstances, lie is more preferred. First of all, telling lie can sometimes motivate the people we care to excel. Humans are very competitive and always want to be the best at every task they have been assigned. Whether they are taking part in an athletic event or taking an examination, they feel more motivated if they think it is possible to archive the best result. You may know the fact that it's an unthinkable thing for some of them. Nevertheless, instead of telling the truth and completely destroying their hope, being a liar in those cases is better. Secondly, being honest at all time may lead you to high level of anxiety. Not all truths are good to be revealed. Some of them can make people unpleasant. For example, last week, my friend asked me what I thought about her new hairstyle. Well, I said frankly it looked terrible. Although she didn't express any anger indication, I knew she was very upset inside. She hasn't talked to me since that day. Therefore, be careful what you are going to say. In a nutshell, telling the truth is crucial. Well, no doubt about it. But, sometimes, you should do the opposite. If not, you may regard about what you said.

You can travel across the Atlantic in your very own cabin which is like a room at a five star hotel. When you arrive, you will be rested. Almost like the struggle of trip have never happened.

Write and Improve is a tool very useful to learn English. For me writing is an important skill, because writing we are forced to use our mind thinking in English. To make up a text needs also creativity. So I have two session of writing in my weekly routine. Write and Improve has more levels of difficulty. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced or Business and there is a section Just for fun. Other parts are related to the IELTS and B2 exam, but I don't know this part. After having selected your level, you can select one of many exercises. The text tells you how many words you have to write. After having finished your exercise, you can check your text. I think this is a very helpful tool. Above all for people like me that are studying on their own and they don't have a check. It's more difficult improve without someone that tells you if you write wrong or right. I think that this tool works very good, but it's always a robot. Maybe sometimes you write correct, but not in a real English. I don't know if there are some phrases more pertinent. Of course I recommend this tool to everyone, because it's well done and especially for people alone or without control.

I think it is true that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Because you cannot take any money to heaven. It could be a waste if you died when you had a lot of money in your hand. But you will not have to worry about your money if you are healthy. Since you are healthy, you can do anything to earn money. You could even gain more knowledge in your life if you were able to live longer. I think that the knowledge is the most important thing in our life.

Hi John, How are you doing? I hope you and your family are doing good. I'm writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things. To begin with, I would like to mention that last week I went to an extraordinary concert by Lady Gaga. As you know, pop music is not my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I decided to go with my bestie, Mike, due to the fact that he had one ticket available for that concert. His sister was supposed to use it but she couldn't make it as she was quite ill. Much to my surprise the concert turned out to be a magnificent spectacle. I realized it from the very moment Lady Gaga started to sing. Her performance was flawless and emotional. Besides, a superb group of dancers were contributing to making it even better in the meantime. It was simply amazing! Needless to say, I had a great time with Mike and not only did I hang out with him but also his cousin, Peter, accompanied me. Refreshments were on me and we danced and sang like never before. Long story short, it was a breathtaking event, and I hope you will be able to join us next time we have a plan. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

I don't think forcing students and school children to do sports activities is a smart answer, to the problems encountered. Indeed, if students are forced to do sport, they may connect the activity to a negative emotion. They would have no choice in the short term, but in the long run it would not be a strategy that benefits them. Because, I met many students who were compelled to do something everyday when they were at school . It could be writing, reading, or doing sports in our case. Most of them, stopped after they finished school or university, because they didn't enjoy these activities. Going to the gym, or on the field was not something they always appreciated. So, it may help us to feel better because we force them doing something, for their own well being. But, it raises a question. What about students want, and how they feel about it ? Actually studies are showing that a moderate physical activity is enough to stay healthy. It includes: walking up the stairs, brisk walking, dancing, gardening etc... Also we know, that one of the main causes of the sedantarity lifestyle, is the interest that young people have in video games. Some schools experimented projects related to these games, and the scope of the activity leads students to walk, run, or jump to find hidden objects for example. The young people didn't feel like they were forced to do sports, because they were taking part to an activity that was fun, relevant, and meaningful to them. My statement is that teachers, could include similar activities to their courses, instead of struggling with students who do not want to do sports for example. It might be a first step to engage children or students, then they may find themselves interested into a sport in particular. However, as long as they have a physical activity on a daily basis, sport is should not be an obligation.

Television is not only entertaining, but also educated. Nowadays, the science and technology era, television has made quite an impact on people. A plenty of people watch TV every day, and the mind or thinking may change because of television. The viewpoints of mine are as follows, First, television is the good medium for people to learn languages. For example, if people want to learn English, they can watch the TV programs of English news or movies. In these TV programs, people can learn the usage of vocabularies, the tone, and so on. Moreover, people can get news and knowledge through television. There are a lot of programs that are educational, such as Discovery channel and National Geographic channel. Television provides many choices for people. We can choose the purpose we need, i. e. entertainment or education. To make the best use of television, and let television brings the biggest effect on us.

Obviously the second one,open design offices are the most effective type of arrangements, from a visual point of view but also from a work point of view. If there aren't walls than separate employees, I think employees can work better and more quickly, because there is cooperation between employees. There are also such disadvantages to no walls offices, there isn't privacy and if you have to focus on a task there can be a lot of noise that can be not given you the good concentration to do that. The type of arrangements of offices although must be choice for the aim of the office, for example if the office is in a bank the type of arrangement better is an office close to preserve the privacy of the customers, but if the office for example is a social media office, the type of arrangement can be a no walls office. In the end the no walls offices are better but for the right employment sectors.

I think that for students are better more teachers or tutors. Each of them have another style of teaching. For example one of them give tend for speaking skills and an other one wants only grammar. in 2018 I had a great English teacher who has a lot of skills for me. I wanted for me all the best, therefore we trained a lot of grammar, reading, speaking and writing. During speaking is very important know many words or vocabularies. Without them is not possibility. It was very important for me know that. To improve listening skills is very important to listen to the radio and podcasts. Every English teachers want to teach students how they can it. I only want to say it that I need to improve my English skills wish more teachers. Is it for me better than less. I may see result in the future. I hope it is true.

It is the best type of requirement. Volunteer work is important to improve human ability, to become better. Nowadays young people don't give the right importance to volunteer work, because for they it's boring and don't give a salary. In our days working is the meantime to take money, hence volunteer work isn't a real work for quite all the younger. It is true ,volunteer work don't give a salary back, but I think give a more important thing than the money, the opportunity to help the other, to become a man. It's a work for the aim and I completely agree with the requirement of some high school to involve students to do volunteer work in order to graduate, it's better for the other but also for the students, because it is maybe the first work of their life. In the end I hope that in future more and more school give the opportunity to their student to do volunteer work in order to graduate, it is the better requirement that a school can do for their students.

Zoos represent a new entertainment for all people, from children to adults. The number of them is increasing more and more every day. This is the reason why no-profit organizations like Green Peace do not agree with that phenomenon. In fact, they believe animals must belong in nature and zoos seem to be prisons rather than peaceful and enjoyable places. In my opinion, there is no point in taking wild animals chained into zoos: they must be got free, as we are. There are many ways and alternative solutions to see them. For example, safari and other tours do not require any restrictions for animals. You can go with a guide and visit these stunning natural parks, admiring the beauty of local wildlfe. I know that the staff of every zoo treat animals well. Moreover, every wrong behaviour and bad treatment is not allowed. Laws are clear and it is a worth. Even though animals are confined in zoos, they are safe and well treated. Anyway, from my point of view I would prefer to see all animals free in their habitat and,in general, in the wild nature, in their right place!

Exercise and practice are very important to improve our skills. They are quite relevant to keep it always fit. However, it seems that all the other things are becoming less important than them. In my opinion, take care of our health is important but it is not the only one: several things get our life coloured. There is no point in getting our body more and more stressed by doing exercises for many hours. In fact, some researchers state that it is sufficient to work out from 30 to 45 minutes. An excessive session might lead to sudden problems. Obviously, we want to avoid them. Not only is a physical exercise important, but also a mental one. Our brain is essential for the whole human body as well as our heart. For example, reading books or doing creative activities such as painting or drawing, are very helpful. The last studies have confirmed how many powerful these activities were. What's more, they can be done in the leisure time. During the week it could be a good idea alternate them with the physical training.

Are you one of these who can't live without traveling? If your answer is yes then this article is for you! For many years we have been travellihg a lot, however with the lockdowns for the CO-VID 19 now we can't travel like in the past. We will have to travel differently from now, for example some countries have suggested creating a digital passport so that everyone knows who has been vaccinated. Also I think that travelling will be more expensive from now on, for the reason that many airlines have lost too much money and only the strongest companies will survive, therefore we will have fewer offers of airplanes and hence the prices could be higher. For this reason I believe that the local tourism will gain importance from now on. Have you ever thought about how many wonderful places your country has? However I hope this current situation has a happy ending and we can travel again like we used to do.

Nowadays it is well known that exercise is very important for our mental and physical health. Firstly it is undeniable that doing exercise consistently can help us boosting our mood, releasing our stress and moreover. As a result, the majority of the population practises at least one sport in their daily basis. Nevertheless, in my opinion we should take care and don't overwhelm us with too much exercise. I have seen people who are always injured owing that they are playing sports for long times and they never take a rest. In conclusion, in my opinion I believe we should practise exercise because it has too many benefits for us, however we also have to be aware that there are more important things we should do in order to have a well balanced life. For instance one important thing which I suggest is to do meditation, for the reason that it is a great way to relax our body and mind.

Schools have been involved in many evolutions for the last decades. They are changing still now, because of the pandemic emergency. New tools and a new approach are tested in order to cope with this hard period. Are there effective? Are not they? What might schools be in the future, after the end of the emergency? These are hard questions to be answered, but we will try to do it in this article. All of us must have stayed indoors, changing our routine deeply. Students get used to attempting online lectures, from the primary school to the university. The goal consists of keeping teaching as best as possible. However, many problems occur in this way. For example, children and teenagers do not receive the same feedback as well as in live lessons: as a result, they cannot learn well new topics and their preparation level gets lower and lower. On the other hand, most university students are doing this kind of activities with good results. Therefore, it seems that universities are going to keep this approach even when the emergency finishes. Will it be so?

Well, it depends on how those works are led because if they are imposed the development of important skills and perceptions can be jeopardized then the learning process will be consequently affected. Let me explain, when a young is forced to do something they do not want to do, they normally do it in a sloppy way which means that the tasks or job will be done jeopardizing both sides, the worker and the work. The worker will not absorb the learning from that task or job and the work will be not so good. On the other hand, when you force a young to do something when they are not encouraged to anything this can help them to discover new things and to learn during the process. So, in my opinion this is something good to be done however, it is highly recommended an experienced advisor to guide them through this journey.

I would like to say that learning to speak a foreign language is more important these days than it was in the past. More and more, people around the world live in this global world recently. We may meet more and more foreigners in our daily life than we could in the past. We should be able to speak another language, especially English, so that we can talk people from around the world. It is a very important thing that being able to speak with people from other countries. Communication is always important in general. Some people would say that we do not have to speak in other languages because we could communicate with translation software. However, I would say that it is not a real communication. We should speak to people directly at any time so that we could communicate our emotions to them as well. Moreover, we could not expect other people to use translation software at any time. This is why I insist on my opinion that we have to learn foreign languages. Hopefully, it is not only English, but also another language, too.

It is different if you study abroad, like erasmus students that must study in a country far from family and friends and do housework in their free time. If you have a chance to live on your own I suggest take this chance. At first time can be really difficult but day by day you become an adult and your pains will be transformated on joys.

Television has a short history, it was invented in the 20th century by an English man. I actually do not know his purpose. Why did he invent such a device? This is not important for the vast majority of society anymore, I guess. No one interrogate why or when anymore, we just enjoy what was invented. We did not ask even if it is harmful, beneficial or anything else. Firstly, I think television is far from educational. It is distraction for children and maybe young adults. We can't deny that there are a few educational channels, but how many of us really get away from the TV series and watch them? The answer is distinctly stands here, almost none of us. Older ladies love soap operas, young adults love shows like GOT or The Bing Bang Theory, and kids mostly watch cartoons. Maybe cartoons are of little use for kids, but their parents should choose them carefully. They can contain violence, sexuality or rudeness. Secondly, besides what I wrote in the first paragraph, there are also benefits. There are news, documentaries and economy channels but I still insist that most of us do not watch those channels or programs. While most people do not like to watch documentaries, since computers and phones became common, nobody uses television for news and stock markets. Phones are more preferred in this regard because they are much more practical. But for people who do not know how to use phone or computer or do not have them still use television for this purpose. As a result, in my opinion, television is not a necessity in our age and it does more harm than good. I think it is far from being educational. We cannot ignore the benefits only during the pandemic period. Children who do not have access to computers and phones in our country attended their classes on television. Other than that, I don't think it has any benefit to education.

The future of travel. I believe the way that we travel is close to change. We can analyze this in two different ways. First, by a short term and second as a long term. In the first term the tourists will visit their own countries more. They will explore more the places in the rural areas. I believe that this will happen because of restrictions on travel abroad imposed by the governments, due to the health situation after the COVID pandemic and other reason is the costs and expenses of the trip. In the first months after the pandemic be controlled, the dollar exchenge rate will still be expensive. But for the long term, the trips will seem like now again. A massive quantity of people will move to the resorts and other touristic places. But if we thought in the further future, maybe in the next 5 or 10 years, I think the people will be able to visit the space and the moon. Who knows?

Sleeping is one of the most indispensable activities in human life. We spend almost one third our life sleeping. Having enough sleep gives us many benefits in terms of both physical and mental health. Clearly, the way we sleep is really matter. While many people prefer a dark and quiet room, others are able to sleep in the noisy atmosphere and a high brightness. I belong to the first group because I believe it will be easier to fall asleep in the quiet environment with a low light. Furthermore, due to the importance of sleep, we need to make sure that we are not affected by any factors like noise and light. Sleeping in this safe environment could result in a better health, which enhances our quality of life.

Nowadays, people can read books on their computers or tablets, or even their smartphones. Then, students in general could use those devices to study in schools or universities. The thing is, should these devices replace books in those situations? In my opinion, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Because they are simply convenient. Books take so much space. Books are also damaged as time goes by. On the other hand, computers and tablets do not take so much space. Also, they can contain a lot of books. More importantly, the students do not need to carry such heavy textbooks. There would be less trouble if they do not have to bring their textbooks all the time. Of course, the computers and the tablets need electricity whereas the books do not need it. However, the advantages of computers and tablets outweigh the disadvantages. On balance, basically, schools and universities should use computers and tablets to get the students study. If there are problems with them, then they should use books in those cases. It is inevitable that the new technology replaces the tradition.

In my opinion, study music can be very interesting to the students, especially for the young students. However, to the older students should be optional. For the younger students the music classes would be very nice to brain development and the increase the cognitive habilits. Music can be very interesting to get better the relationship among the students too, especially the students can create a band, for instance. In all the ages the music is good, but it is better for the children, the music can be a way they became more calm and concentrate too. For the teenagers students, it can be optional, because these students have a lot of disciplines, they need to practise many sports too, they must prepare for the university too. But, for the teenagers also music can be important. They can improve many potential skills, like the concentrate because in this life stage it is common to be agitade and the music can help.

It depends on the opportunity, it depends on the financial conditions, it depends what the sutdents desiree. The student needs to think about many things. First of all, what do you want?

Are you one of those who have wondered about how the schools of the future will be like? If your answer is yes this article is for you. It is true that the schools haven't changed a lot these last years. Nevertheless with the arrival of the pandemic they have been forced to adapt. Nowadays there are a lot of virtual classrooms and in the future I believe there will be even more of them. As a result some students are happy owing the fact that they don't have to spend time going to school, besides they can attend their lessons from a comfortable sofa. However, we don't have only advantages with these modifications. Since for the students the contact with their classmates is highly important. In conclusion, I believe that in the future the schools will change and probably digital schools will gain a big presence in our society, even though the schools we know won't disappear for the reason that we're humans and we need contact with each other.

In the world of today technology take us a lot of time even when we are studying something. Books are since the writing's born a great resources for students and for humans, but in these years, they are replaced by technology such as tablets and computers and online sites such as Wikipedia. I think that technology is a great in school and my opinion is that it should completely replace books in schools and universities. You can find the same materials in a book like in computers because there are a lot of sites where you can find information about something, or even digital-books that you can buy online . Technology in school is better because it is more efficient and more quickly than books, and this can be great for a student that have not much time to study.

As I see it, I subscribe to the view point that learning to play a musical instrument it's an important thing for all students. Firstly, owing to the fact that there are too many researches where they have discovered that the students who learned how to play an instrument have better abilities in learning to acquire a new language. In addition, playing an instrument could help to improve the coordination among our senses. For instance, in order to play well the piano you must have a good coordination between your sense of hearing and your sense of touch. Secondly, due to the fact that playing an instrument is an enjoyable way which can help students to relieve them of their stress that they might have for the exams, tasks and so on. In conclusion, I support the study of music in school for our children, for the reason that in my opinion it is a useful class with a lot of benefits.

I agree with this statement. Money are important in our life. We need money to live. We could have a minimal life, but we need money for food, for paying the rent, for buying some closet. There are some things necessary to live. I mean to be rich with a high level of wealthy. Everybody would like earn an income very high. But if we have a good income and we can't enjoy it, because we aren't healthy. So I think that healthy is very important to enjoy life. Our life is so short and we have to focus not only on the money, but on the small things. It is not a minimal way of life. I mean not so minimal. We can choose our just fit. If to be rich we have to struggle every day, tons of hours and then we haven't time to enjoy it I think that it isn't a good idea. We can set up what we need to live and be wealthy to enjoy it.

Hey, how have you been? Last week I went to a concert with a friend. It was from The Rose. They are a Korean band. we had regular tickets. When we were waiting to enter, it started to rain and I was really cold. when we finally entered the hall after three and a half hours of waiting, we stood in the middle of the hall a little to the front. They came up and everyone started to scream. It was a really good concert and I was having the best time of my life. Unfortunately, something had to go wrong. I fainted two times. The first time I stood right back up because I didn't want to miss the rest of the concert. After 20 minutes I faited again. But this time I don't remember what happend. All I know is when I opened my eyes, a light was shining on me so that the security could find me and I was taken outside.

When I was younger, my group of friends started a short non-governamental organization in my city that called "Social hug." As I live in Brazil and the Brazilian schools don't require of them students a certain amount of volunteer work, I did all the work in this ONG because I wanted to. Years later - or nowadays - I can see how important was biullding this project and working on it. I knew a lot of people who are my close friends until today and the best part of this is what makes us friendship to happen: the wish to care eath other. Certainly, every volunteer work that a person can make will shake a lot of inner feelings out and make he thinking about the society's problems, asking for himself questions such as: "where I fit in this societey?" Why those people need my help?" " What is the impact of my actions?." In the end of the experience, I'm sure that everyone will become a better human being.

Health is a thing that is very discussed. I think that when we talk about health we can't make a list of important things, because health is not only one thing, but is a mix of things that affect strongly our body. I think that there are a lot of things that are important for our health, like diet and exercise and water. Exercise is fundamental because it help us to reduce stress, and help also to our body's health. Diet is important when we talk about health, it is a primary thing for our body and if you have a bad diet surely you have also a bad health because you don't feed your body correctly and you don't give it the right aliments . In my opinion to have a healthy life you have to improve these things because surely your life will go a lot better.

Nowadays it is a fact that we spend too much time watching TV. Therefore, we must know that the programs we choose to watch can make a huge impact for our daily basis and influence us. It is a fact that most of the people would rather watch TV shows without any meaning than documentaries where they can learn new interesting things, for the reason that TV shows can be more pleasant. However if you are a person who wants to learn new things you can find plenty of channels where they broadcast useful programs. In addition if you want to acquire a new language you have the option of changing the language and adding subtitles of your favourite films or TV series that you usually watch. In conclusion I believe that the television it's mostly used to amuse people, though if you want to educate yourself while watching the TV you have the option to do it.

After graduating from high school students have to make tough decisions. Maybe the toughest one is to choose a university. Is it better to stay in your hometown or maybe to move away? Young people face a lot of challenges. One of them might be adapting to a new environment. If a student chooses to stay in a hometown he will have the support of his family. Not only mental support is necessary. Living in big city, where the best universities are located, is usually expensive. The cost of renting an apartment has risen significantly during the last decade. Moreover, the cost of public transport should also be considered. Staying with parents is a much more cost-saving option. It allows students to make substantial savings, that will be crucial in their future lives. Whereas staying at home has a lot of advantages, it is not an ideal option. Moving to another city might be very developing for high school graduates. It allows students to make new friendships. It is also a space to test a responsibility. Some people call it "the school of life." I agree that it is a test of maturity and some young people need it. Another thing is that people in their twenties desire independence. Moving away to study is a great way to achieve it. To sum up, in my opinion, going to another city to study is a better option than staying at home. However, I recommend visiting parents regularly.

The books are necessary, you have a guide and it's where you learn things, a lot of things. I don't recommend the students study in tables and computers, because your eyes suffer a lot and in the future will have a lot of problems and diseases in our eyes and perhaps some body could lose its sight. Technology devices are very important and necessary for the students, the carry out a huge knowledge in a click, they can learn all of them need and it's very easy work with other students, make teamworks online, for search information and share homework, etc...

For example if I know Spanish I can travel and speak with other people in a great number of countries like Brazil, Spain Perù and Mexico. Speak one or more foreign languages can help you also at work because the great number of companies search people who speak many languages because it is important for the commerce.

There is no doubt these days, so many people have been speaking diffreant languages beside their mother langouge from centreis until now. The question is, it is necessary to have knowledge about other langouges as before? In this essay I am going to discuss both views and draw my own opinion. In terms of positive side, some studies said, it is necessary to speak important langouges espicailly English and Spanish. The main reason given to support this claim is, The eightey percent from scintist langouge was written by English and 20% by other langouges. To illustrate that, if you wish to be profficinal in your spicialize you have to be flunt in English. In other words most of the Universities arownd the world are teaching by English. In other side some people against this side and strongly believe in learn any abroud langouge has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, while learning any langouge you will get their culture as a part of your study and this knowledge would effect your believes and thought about his own faith. Secondly, a lot of books and information were translated to the national langouge. Finally, Google translate could help any one to get any decomant from any langouge to any other langouge by free. In conclousion, I believe that, it is really important to learn the most famous of them as English which is mandatory to complete high educatinal degree.

My reasons for learning English: Being able to speak a foreign language can be very advantageous. There are plenty of reasons for learning a new language and find one's passion. In this essay I will focus on the English language and explain my reasons for learning it. First of all, when being able to speak English there are almost no boundaries of communication. Since English is an international language or 'lingua franca' the majority of the world's popolation has knowledge of English. Thus, one can have conversations with people all over the world. Moreover, the English language, especially the British accent is very charming in my taste. I adore listening to it and therefore would love to speak so. Furthermore, I love to listen to modern music. The fact that nearly every song is in English incites me to learn English the more. Accordingly I am able to understand all lyrics.

we live in a capitalist society, a massive number of doctors prefer priorities money instead of thinking in create a better society, of course a doctor who has studied during almost teen years to obtain his diplom must earn a reasonable salary to compense the time invested in his profession. But in my opinion a doctor should have the desire to treat people despite of the social conditions. Doctors prefer to work in cities instead of rural areas especially because of the money and because it provides better conditions to exercise his work, I had visited a city where the hospitals where in collapse because of an outbreak, without conditions to help people because there wasn't medicine and not even equipment to protect themselves. Based on my knowledge, there is ways to solve these problems, the authorities should invest more money in instructure in rural areas and pay and extra money as an insensitive to doctors who work in rural areas, in my country the federal government hired immigrants from Cuba to work in rural areas.

It is a common belief that it is good for students to have the same teacher for several years. However, I am against that idea for some reasons. First, when students have the same teacher for several years, they tends to familiar with the teaching methods of that teacher and find it is hard to change. That leads them to be passive and inflexible in studying. Besides, working with many teachers as much as possible will make students change their attitude and their studying methods as well. Therefore, they can gain a lot of experience and precious knowledge in daily life. Secondly, I think it must be boring and dull when I have the same teacher for many years. Students usually want to try something new and interesting. So, many teachers can bring many emotions for them. Whatever it is, it maybe change their life in some ways. Another reason is that a new teacher is a new opportunity. Not all students have their favorite teacher at the beginning. Hence, if the first teacher is not suitable for them, it is okay. They will have the second, the third, the fourth,.. teacher until they have suitable one. To sum up, I believe that it is better when students have new teachers each year.

A child born today is predicted to live up ninety years, an age 20 years higher than just fifty years ago. Furthermore, statistics show that in the twenty-first century when almost every day a groundbreaking new medical treatment is discovered, life expectancy will increase each year about six months. But is it actually good that lives last so long or are short, but intense lives better? The answer is clear, when keeping in mind that long lives are unnecessary, when having lived a short but intense life where everything wanted was achieved. Experiencing everything longed for, a long life would conversely be boring and depressing as nothing new can be discovered. Therefore, shorter but exciting lives should certainly be preferred. Additionally, what is clearly more appealing when having a shorter life is that there are usually no health issues. Accordingly, living an active and fun life is achieved more easily, when being young. As a result having happy time on earth is spent much simpler, than when being older.  The last and most important argument supporting the thesis that living shorter but more intensively is better than having a long life, is that dying at an old age is often connected to paint. By this, not only physical pain, caused by diseases is meant, but also emotional suffering. As a long life is lived, deaths and losses of loved ones will be experienced which can cause tremendous emotional distress. As a result, the long life is not as appealing as before when experienced without friends and family.  In conclusion, it becomes very clear, that growing old and living a calm life should be seen more critically than a short but intense life, for the various reasons explained above.

In the first place I have to say that universities are spread across the entire world, there is not a single country without it. There are different ways to experience university. On one hand we have students who live at home with their family, on the other hand we have students who decide to move to another town on their own. If I had to choose where I would prefer to stay, I would surely prefer to stay with my family. Especially because they pay for my needs and I can focus on studying and passing the various exams, but most importantly I can count on the support form my family when something goes wrong. For example when you fail an exam, and you have to retake it again. It is the worst feeling you can experience. Besides, moving to another country can help a lot of students grow up. That is because it allows you to pay for your living, you have to work, to pay and you also have to study for your exams. You can make new friends in your new country, maybe friends that are attending the same school as you. By and large, scholars usually live with their family while studying, because it is simpler than going alone to a new place and leaving your comfort zone. In conclusion, as I said before I prefer to experience university by staying in my comfort zone and focus more on studying.

Currently, some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I partly agree with this type of requirement for some reasons. It is undeniable that doing volunteer will help students gain a lot of hands-on experience. They have to do teamwork projects, hand out leaflets, take care of the old and so on. That leads them to learn how to organise event or something that they have never done before. As the result, they gain many useful skills that must be used in univeristy. Moreover, that requirement makes student do more outdoor activities instead of doing meaningless stuffs at home. Thus, they can spend their valuable time on doing good things. On the other hand, it is not always have positive sides. That high schools makes students have a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate will bring them the unwilling feeling. Then, they can find it's hard to do the volunteer work effectively. They just do the volunteer work until it reaches the certain amount. So, the volunteer work looses its meaning and becomes the burden for students. Besides, doing volunteer work can distract students from their school work. They have to divide their time for doing social work. So, they must balance the subjects in school and their volunteer work in a suitable way. In conclusion, I think the high schools should consider the amount of the volunteer work as a strength of each student and don't put stress on them. Let students do that work if they want to.

Nowadays people have strssful lives, everyone tries to do many things in a short time such as working, exercing, spending time with friends and family. As a result of this lifestyle, sleep has become the only opportunity to rest. Personally speaking, I prefer sleeping with lights off and with as little noise as possible. This is the only way that I'm able to have a pretty good rest, sometimes when I'm so exhausted I'm able to sleep with lights on but it's not the same situation with the noise, even if I'm so tired, I can't sleep. To sum up, people have different ways to sleep but the most important is that you be able to sleep as minimun 8 hours. I believe that having a good rest results in good health for everyone.

University life is an interesting experience, and I think nowadays everyone can experience university life. In my opinion, I think it is an important experience, and the reason why I think it's really important is it will give us a lot of advantages for exploring the best version of us and it is going to affect us a lot in the way we think about our future. There are many ways we can have a good experience in university life, and it depends on how we face it. Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family while they are students. I think it is not important. You can live wherever you want, you live on your own while you are attending school, that's cool, or you want to live at home with your family while you are students, that's very nice. As I said you can live wherever you want, but the most important thing is whether you enjoy living there or do you have any plan for your journey. The most important thing is you.

It's a common belief that video games can have a negative impact on children. However, I am against that idea for the following reasons. We all are in the modern world which is full of smart equipment, so the entertainment tools of course are different from the things we used to have. Most of them have to do with technology and video games is an example of the popular entertainment way with children these days. Video games is available and covenient in our modern devices like TV, smartphone,... So, children don't have to think much of what they can play in their free time. Besides, children can be relaxed at their home instead of going to the cinemas, parks, game centres. Moreover, video games are interesting and various. Many game manufacturers have to compete for more profits, which makes them create better video games than their rivals. Then, there are many wonderful games for your children from educational one to entertaining one. Educantional games can provide your children with many necessary skills to survive such as making deceison, matching clothes, designing homes... Another reason is that your children can make friends through video games. Online video games allow people to play with others from different countries, so children can buil more friends relationships, learn other languages and cultures as well. It is very useful in the multicultural world. In conclusion, playing video games have many benefits that should be encouraged more.

Televison is a widely used medium. Apart from it being entertaining, I also believe that it can be educative. Televison can be used for multiple purposes. These are for example entertainment, advertsing but also education. The purpose differs per programme. The television shows on the commercial channels are often more entertaining, whereas the ones on public service broadcasting are often educational. Examples of educational programmes are documentaries about a variety of subjects, such as a new earth. There are also many educational programmes for kids, like 't klokhuis. Apart from that there are also programs which are both entertaining and educational such as 'the secret of the master' which is a painting show where the viewers also learn about art history. These shows are educational because the viewers learn from it. In conclusion, television can also be educational. It depends on the kind of television show and the purpose of the makers.

Hi Lucy, How are you? I am great. I went to a concert last week and it was spectacular. Giant Rooks was performing with Declan Mackenna as a support act. I discovered these artists on Spotify and when I heard that they were coming to the Netherlands I just had to go. Giant Rooks is an alternative indie-pop band from Germany. The songs I like most form them are Heat Up and The Birth of Worlds. Declan Mackenna is from the United Kingdom and he also writes alternative music. The visuals at the concert were great and both bands were really good live. You should check them out on Spotify. I hope I will see you soon. Kind Regards, Sarah

Television is an object that we use everyday for many things. Many people think that it can only entartain but I not agree with this idea because I think that television can also educate. I think that television is a great way for study because you can learn a lot of things from different programmes such as documentaries, realities and tv shows. Furthermore on television go on programmes that are about science, history, literature and other things and this can help the people to expand their knowledge about the programme that they are seeing. For instance if you see a documentary about something, surely after you finish it you know more thing about this argument. In my opinion television is a great method to spend time when you are boring, but it is great also if you want to learn something more.

HEALTHY LIVING According to a recent study, doing exercise is really important and useful for our health. Therefore, there is no doubt that exercise could help to you in order to have a healthy living. But, do you think there are other things or activities more important than exercise? For example, I strongly believe that a good diet as well as sleeping are important facts too. Regarding food, once somebody said to me: "what we eat, is what we are." So you have to include in your diet healthy food like vegetables and fruit. In the other hand, you have to rest in a comfortable bed in order to have a good mental health the following day. Doctors recommend sleeping at least eight hours per day. To sum up, there are three things to help you to have a healthy living: doing exercise every day, eating more vegetables and fruit and, last but not least, sleeping as well as you can.

LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE I strongly believe that is really necessary and useful to know how communicate fluently with other foreign speakers.

To sum up, due to globalization is really useful and important learning a new language.

Music courses can be commonly found in Indonesia. Although it is common, some people assume that music class should not have been a mandatory subject for every student. Music is each person's personal interest and students should not be forced to learn it. Music may be important in modern society as music has been a part of humans' life since the ancient era. However, some part of the community may not be interested in learning music and just love to listen to those melodies. In addition, there may be some people who totally hate music for personal reasons. Moreover, music can be learned by autodidact. Recent survey claims that learning will be more effective when students are sincerely learning it and not by curriculum enforcement. However, school should still provide music classes and set them to be elective classes as some students may need tutors to learn how to play musical instruments. To conclude, music is an important part for the community, but it is not appropriate to be a mandatory subject in school. Instead, school should make music classes as elective subject to encourage students' sincerity in learning it.

Hi Paul, What's up? I'm writing to you in order to tell you a couple of things, but, first of all, let me tell you that I hope you and your family are doing good. To begin with, I would like to mention one of my favourite dishes, which is called "porra." This meal consists of a cold soup made of some fresh vegetables, specifically tomatoes, green peppers, and garlic. Once the soup is made, you can add a little olive oil in order to flavour it. Besides, you can introduce some proteins, such as boiled egg, tuna, or some cured ham. I assure you it is delicious and quite tasty. With regard to the proper time to eat it, I would like to point you out that it is a dish which is mostly eaten in summer, due to the high temperatures we have to deal with. That's why cold soups are perfect for summertime. Nevertheless, some drawbacks should be mentioned, as it is the case of the difficulties finding these ingredients in other seasons, let alone the quality of the products. Despite the downsides, I can't help but say that I do enjoy eating this food, even though vegetables were not my cup of tea when I was younger, but now that I am aware of their importance in our diet, I appreciate them more than ever. What about you? Is there any food you enjoy eating? Let me know if there is so. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards,

Zoos are excellent places for people to visit in many special occasions like birthdays, anniversities and so on. However, It is thought that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. I am against that idea for the following reasons. We all know that zoos are other shelters of animals accept for their natural habitats. Zoos make a contribution to conserve wild animals and endangered animals as well. Zookeepers take the responsibile for feeding, caring animals. That leads animals not to have to seek their foods at danger anymore. Moreover, they can survive in safe and convenient environment: they don't need to camouflage or do anything to avoid being attack by their rivals because their cages are totally separated from others. Medical services and special carings are always provided in any cases. Besides, animals can give birth at beneficial conditions thanks to trained zoo staff. Another reason is that zoos are wonderful places for people to learn about animals. Instead of going to the deep forests or mysterious valleys, people can easily observe animals and learn about their habits. Moreover, zoos are also ideal places to spend the weekend and just relax after hard working hours. To sum up, zoos are still necessary places for people these days.

'It drives me up the wall!', said one student early this morning when he, sitting next to a computer screen, learned that all university students be advised to excrcise three times a week. This notice was immediately understood as an abrasive and nosy by many students, but, not so surprisingly, there is a good reason for embedding this rule. The research shows university student in general and computer nerds in particular are activity-deprived individuals with fitness level so poor it raises a red flag for their physicians. Not only have some students stopped any exercising, but they substantially minimized their exposure to sun, fresh air, and shockingly, some of them even do not leave their dormitories any more. Although the lockdown and curfew exacerbates the situation further, the real problem is mostly the inherent lazines of the students. Therefore, the college council suggested mandatory sports activities at least three times a week for everyone. Albeit justifiable, the decision triggers a question of personal freedome. Can the council indeed force students to engage in sports activities? Some argue this is simply illegal, and thus, impossible to do so. But, this coin has another side as well. The council is a body fully responsible for well-being of students and as such, it is entitled to take care of their mental and physical health. Therefore, the above mentioned statement is conceivable. Clearly, this non-trivial affair will ignite a fierce disputation in the next student assemblage. But, given the ussual bland and boring discussions, it is a great achievement as well. Our colleague Bend-Over shrewdly commented this situation is a lose-lose situation: students are mad at the council, therefore they will hesitate to exercise. He gingerly suggested to encourage students' sporting activity by providing them free access to the gym and the swimming pool.

I would like to write about my favourite season of the year. I would definitely like to say that it is winter. Some people say that they like spring, autumn or summer. But I just would like to say that spring and summer are damp and hot. Also, there are a lot of insects, especially in summer. So, there are also a lot of noise of chirps, inevitably. Therefore, you could not sleep at night. On the other hand, winter is quiet, calm and fresh. You could be in warm and comfortable clothes as well. Indeed, it could also be freezing and therefore stressful. However, that is what it is. In winter, you are able to enjoy a lot of warm food and soup. What is more, you are able to sleep in a warm blanket comfortably. In any case, I am sure that all people are going to agree that winter is tranquil. I love such a quiet time, wholeheartedly. The day, which snows all day long, would be much better, too. I wish that I could live in a country like it. I hope it will be true.

Sometimes people want to find something brand new and almost their priority is going abroad. I realized that there is the same thing happening to students: some of them choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. Of course, it always has both advantages and drawbacks. I want to start with advantages first. Studying abroad is an opportunity for students to access to different study environment. There, they can work with foreigners as much as possible. That leads them to learn other languages quickly and effectively. Moreover, the amount of knowledge they gained is significant. Students will be familiar with modern study equipment, scientific teaching methods and working styles of foreigners. Therefore, it is easy for them when they had a chance to work in an international company or embassy. So, they will make a contribute to develop their mother country. Besides, when students study abroad, they will gain more experience. Because they have to live far away their family, they had no chance but taking care of themselves. They will know how to prepare a meal and manage their money. Another advantage is that students can make more friends and enjoy the feeling of a traveller while they are studying. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of studying abroad. The noticeable thing I want to say is the homesick feeling. Students will miss their family and their classmate much and feel alone sometimes. Besides, in the beginning, they maybe get some culture shocks and can't be adapted other customs. My friend studied aboard in China and she haven't eaten some Chinese dishes until now. Moreover, people can be racist when they study abroad beccause of their skin colors or their cultures. Sometimes there are annoying people who enjoy playing a trick on others. In conclusion, studying abroad has its own advantages and drawbacks. Whatever, "one day of travel will bring you a wealth of wisdom."

How will we travel in the future ? It is an interesting question. I am trying to reply to it. Currently, new cars are invented. These new cars work with electric motors, without petrol. Others can drive without drivers ! These cars have a computer as a driver. Maybe, in 2050's, motorcycles, cars, lorries, trains could transport everyone without product pollution, but not yet for the airplanes. The traffic will be less noisy than today. There will also get less car accidents. Unfortunately, the driver's licence will not exist, which will get people less independent. However, people need to think about which future we wish. In fact, the lorry and ship traffics are issues for the planet. Lorries, airplanes and ships use very much petrol to transport the different objects to sell. A lot of things must travel to be sold to customers. We need to think what customer we will become, with which behavior. These thoughts force us to turn into our ways to use cars, lorries, airplanes and ships.

I think that Write and Improve is a greatly useful program for English language learners, especially people who want to practise their writing. Thanks to this program, I am sure that I have gotten used to writing English sentences. I assume that getting used to writing is very important for English language learners. It actually benefits you, because you are going to find some kinds of useful impression. I was lucky enough to find Write and Improve. I think that all learners who want to improve their writing skill should use Write and Improve. This program is actually similar to writing a diary. I suppose that most people would agree that writing a diary is going to improve their English. However, there is a problem. There is not always something to write for your diary, although, most people have it. This program allows us to write something in English if we do not have anything to write. So, people who use Write and Improve are able to improve their skills in any case. Last but not least, this program gives you feedback. You are able to recognise your mistakes in your sentences, easily. This is very useful and important for learners of English. Although It is a shame that sometimes I cannot understand why my sentence is not good, it is useful, anyway. I am going to use this for a long time as well. However, it would be the best to be taught from an English tutor so that we could be better writers in English.

This time, I would like to write of a problem, which is about medical doctors. It is that most medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money. Yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I think that the reason for this problem is about money. So, if the doctors in rural areas get as much money as the other doctors who work in cities, the problem would be solved. Because the doctors who work in cities do not need to work in cities for their money. Then, how this could be done? I think that the government should control it. They should collect and distribute money to doctors in their countries, fairly. Therefore there will not be any inequalities in the salary. Thus the doctors in rural areas are not going to need to think about their money. I think that I have to read more English sentences so that I would be able to improve my writing skill. The sentences, which I have written above, are horrible.

It is very tricky to answer the question "are there things that are more important than exercise for our health?." To be honest, I think that exercise is the most effective way to improve our health. First, exercise keep your body fit and flexible. When you do yoga, karate or just simple do the morning exercise, you must move and use many part of your muscle. That leads to release the energy and reduce the unnecessary lipit. At the same time, your limbs will be familiar with that intense training, then your movement can beflexible and you can do many things than before easily. As the result, your strength gradually improves. Apart from the physical benefits, you will gain a pleasant mental health. According to an article written by a group of scientists at Oxford, exercise can reduce stress and help you to have better sleep. As far as I'm concern, a person who frequently exercise has the positive energy and to be carefree than somebody doesn't. Moreover, exercise is a cheap way to improve our health compared to other ways like going to the health care centre or hiring a private doctor. Besides, it can enhance our patience and self-managing. In conclusion, exercise is important for our health for special ways that no method has.

Telling the truth is an interesting subject to discuss together. In my opinion, it is really important to speak the truth but everything always has two sides, the good side, and the bad side. Because I think telling the truth is good or not is depends on you and also depends on the situation. If you want to make others happy but you know the truth will hurt them and you don't want it to happen then it is acceptable to tell a lie. As I think a lie with a good purpose is better than telling the truth but it's going to hurt others. I think it is difficult to figure out telling truth or lie is a good thing. As I said it is good or not it depends on you and also depends on the situation, so there will not be a specific formula for us to apply. As I know people tell a lie every single day and when they tell a lie they are not even thinking about it. Humans always tell a lie but it is a harmless lie. In some situations you have to tell the truth because if you tell a lie it is going to affect other people in a bad way, telling the truth is very important in work because when you tell the truth, everyone in the work can know the bad thing in their job and they can improve. In some situations telling a lie is better than telling the truth, such as a friend you just meet.

It is no doubt that schools nowadays change faster than ever as we see the differences year by year, I imagine if I travelled to space and came back to earth 10 years from now I would be too old to catch up with the new systems that would be developed but how so? I think that in the future schools will have more classes and each class will include only 10 to 15 kids so that the teacher can make sure they all understand, I imagine self-learning will implemented on a regular bases since self-learning will be a thing technology will be required as will, I think moving forward exams with open books will be normal for kids and teachers will be more creative coming up with their exams questions since they will evaluate students understanding rather than memorizing the information, I imagine that mental health education will be included. What will stay in future is the need for teachers, technology will stay as will I believe sports will be played more often since these classes encourage creativity and plays a big role on mental health.

School's areas will be different that now. In coronavirus time we can see a lot of changes in the school. It is online teaching, online education, online homework et cetera. Older times I think don't come again in the same ways. Learning at home is better for many students because thex do not wake up early. The same will be only grades and specific of grades. Children might know what they want to do than other people. In big cities there are much possibilities for them. We had a good education and we could go to school without masks. We had known everything in our mind. There are much difficulties than before. Children will be better and they will be working alone with online courses. The school of the future is present and I am looking forward to learning a new thing. We will have to change our mind and our old behaviour and to go to future and to go to new technologies. Many ways are better for them and they can choose the best ways for them. We would see in future years. Thank you.

AUTUMN: THE MOST COLORFUL SEASON OF THE YEAR If someone asked me which is my favourite season, surely I'm going to ask Autumn.

During studying students face some difficulties, one of them is being a student far away from familiy. Actually this has both advantages and disadvantages. in my opinion studying away from family has more advantages than disadvantages. While studying far from home first might be hard to struggle some challenges like finding a house or a job for living by themselves without family funding, throughout these difficulties students will have a chance to struggle them and it will be a lesson to them how to live alone and how to overcome those problems. For example a student during his or her education term in another city moreover in another country has a chance for him or her to take into control to using and saving their money this will help their life in future, wheares studying with their family might be easier but rest of their life they might face some challenges and they must solve and manage them alone.

I think that the enclosed workstations or the cubicles are more preferable to the employees rather than the open designs. It is undoubtedly true that some employees want to be in a private space. It is not necessarily true that the open atmosphere has an advantage over the closed one. Moreover, the employees who do not want to be in an open space would feel stressful if they were in such an open area. On the other hand, the other employees, who want to be in more open space, can go to more open areas. For example, there should be meeting rooms or lobbies. When they want to communicate with other employees, they are able to do it in such open spaces. Therefore, the employees, who are introvert, do not have to feel pressured. If anything, the employees, who are extrovert, should go out to open places. This is why I think that the enclosed workstations or the cubicles are more preferable to a lot of people. Despite that I think that most people prefer the enclosed ones, I assume that the open designs have the advantage of getting the employees more cooperative. Because they have to be more open if they were in such situations. I suppose that it would be better in a sense. Whether or not they would like it.

I think that the requirement of that, students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate, is a good idea. Because the students were able to get a good experience from that volunteer work. For instance, they are able to know that doing things, which are helpful to people, is very rewarding. What is more, to do so, they are able to feel that, they are a member of the society. It would be a very good thing for their mentality. People should think about their society, even if when they are young, so that they would be sure that they have to help each other to live in the world. This is why I think that having the requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate is a good idea. It would be better if it is done before they graduate their high school, because they are about to be adults. By the way, there would be some students, who cannot do those kinds of work, due to some kinds of problems. In those cases, they do not necessarily have to do it. Instead, the schools should provide something for them.

Let's be clear. My favourite season of the year is the spring from afar. To tell you the truth, the main reason is because I can wear each one of my clothes no matter what the time is. During the spring, it's not cold as it could be in autumn or in winter. However, the weather isn't as hot as in the summer. It offers several things. The first one is to be able to go out without worrying about the temperatures outside. On the other hand, the vegetation is growing while this period. So having a walk, either in the parks or in the gardens, becomes a real privilege. Finally, here usually comes the seasons of the big events, of the year, like the festivals and so on. I could also say that in France you have a lot of holidays at this period, so you're really free to rest and enjoy the season.

Our watching television is horrible because it is waste our time. Ever. I would like to say that we can see a lot of people what they watch serials and other spots. A lot of time go unnecessary away. One way is only program with education videos. For example National geographic, et cetery. Entertains is around us a lot. We had had a television when I was younger. I watched only farytails and some news. This time our children are watching a television nonstop without breaks. The television and computer are capital devices for them. They are still going to.

Many people claim that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Personally speaking, I agree with this statement. Firstly, owing to the fact that if we don't have a good health condition we can't enjoy our life therefore it doesn't matter if we have a lot of money because we won't be able to benefit from it. Secondly, for the reason that if we are healthy we can do sports or spend time with our family and we don't need to be rich to do these things. Although for me the most important thing is to have a well balanced life. Consequently I believe that we should take care of our habits in order to have a healthy life and at the same timehave enough money to be financially free. In conclusion, being healthy it's by far more important than being rich. Nevertheless, we must be careful with our financial due to the fact that it is relevant for our life.

Although I feel that students should not be required to have any compulsory lectures, I also support that they should take some particular ones or responsibilities for graduation. The most famous responsibility type given at schools is volunteer works. I base my idea on two reasons. First and foremost, working as a volunteer give students responsibility of a task. With the aim of complete their tasks, they try to finish their work and this experience will most probably help them not only graduate but also to land a job in the future. Secondly, volunteers contribute to the workpower in marketplace while doing their tasks and needless people benefit from these volunteers' contributions very much. Thanks to their efforts, according to the recent statistics, volunteering process at schools become much more important than before. Authorities of schools focus on these tasks. In a nutshell, volunteering is very beneficial to both students and people who need help. Through this way, students can get good grades, graduate and find a good job.

In spite of countless examples and benefits of working in offices without having walls like the one at the Google, I strongly hold the belief that it is much more efficient to work in enclosed workplaces. I based my choice on two reasons. First and foremost, I personally can not concentrate on my work while I am in open area where other people, even if they are my co-workers, can easily gaze at me. Provided that I have a personal area, I can burn the midnight oil unhesitantly. Without listening conversations, music and unnecessary and unimportant trivial sayings, I most probably manage to do my best. For instance, last week I worked in a cubic for a project. Unfortunately, other peoples' voices disturbed me so much that our company lost getting of the government financial aid to the project since I failed to submit a well-prepared draft. Secondly, time goes too fast. There are many innovations and developments not only in technology but also in other fields. Thus, it should be ready to be open for new things. Even though it seems to be a new, modern approach to work in open areas, independent, homeoffice working is newer, recent steps taken by employers. In a nutshell, it is better to work in a personal space for me to be able to roll up my sleeves. Through this way of working, I can focus on my tasks much more efficiently. What's more, working individually and independently is a new working style of today's world.

In my opinion learning music and playing some instrument must be given as a lecture Because music will help students to relax after a long and tiring school day most students have some lectures they do not like as math or literature. During some lectures like these some of them get bored upon this to learn and enjoy something music could be an option for them and study music and playing musical instruments should be chosen by students and it can be more effective and faster on their learning. Also students should be educated about everything and should know at least some information about those things so music and play a musical instrument is one of them. some students may have talent to play a musical instrument very well than learn math or literature lectures that is why students have a chance to improve their talent instead of studying a lecture which they do not like or have not passion to learn it.

In my opinion, books are the most important things in our life. Because books teach us "What is life?" and "How can we live fairly?." There are lots of factor which books teach us. So, I against, computers and tablets replace books in life. They shouldn't replace completely at least. We know, technology improves and extensive but I say before, they shouldn't replace completely. We need to touch books paper and we need to feel them. The books beautiful and valuable like this. Hence, we should take possession of them and protect them against who wants to perish them. As a result, there are too many things which we learn from books. We shouldn't permit to replace any technolocigal development instead of books. On the other hand, we must read more and more and improve ourselves. I admire all of books.

Moreover the young always is listening to music. Learn music is a good way to forget the problems with other disciplines and it is help too to making friends. Always is good learn something new.

In my opinion, all students in schools should study music in their classes. I assume that, generally, people in the world love music. They have to know about music to some extent. So, at least, they should play musical instruments for some times. For example, I think that the piano would be a good example for the students to play the musical instrument. And then, hopefully, it is preferable if there were some kinds of study, which is related to music. What is more, learning to play a musical instrument with the other students would help the student work with the classmates. Playing music as a part of the band would be a good experience for the students as well. I do not think that playing music have to be obligatory, but it should be studied to some degree. This is why I think that all students in schools should study music in their classes. By the way, I do not disagree that there are some people who hate music. In that case, they do not have to study music in school. Music should be loved, and that is an important thing.

I think that university students should move away and live on their own while they are attending school. Thus, they are able to nurture their independence. When they are adults, they have to live by themselves. I suppose that a university student is half adult, and half child. Therefore, when they are at university, they should also get used to living on their own. Hopefully, they are able to get their parents' help. Of course, they should not completely depend on their parents, but they should depend on their parents to some extent. For example, their parents should pay school expenses. What is more, the students should not work for money. They do not forget that they are at university for studies. However, I agree that working for experience is good for the student's experience. On the other hand, there are some students, who live at home with their family while they are students. I do not think that is a bad thing. Living with the family would benefit to their finance. In most cases, they do not have to do housework on their own. Consequently, they are able to have more time to study. It is definitely a good thing. On balance, moving away and living at home, both of them are not bad at all.

Well, I believe that sometimes is acceptable to tell a lie. It is very difficult, maybe impossible, tell the truth all the time. It will be hard, and so disagreable tell the truth all the time. Imagine if you tell the truth for your wife all the time. You stopped to talk with a friend in the street, nothing wrong, but your wife needed you quickly, so you said that the traffic was bad, because of this you were late, end of the history, no fight, no problem. There are many examples to show how it is reasoble to lie sometimes, for instance, if a person ask you about her clothes, or about the new hair colour, or about the results of the plastic cirurgy, and you consider ugly, or a disaster. What should you say? The truth? Worth? Of course that not. It's better to lie, perhaps not all lie, it is not necessary to say, it is beautiful, but you can it is not bad (the truth is bad), but which the value to make the person sad? It is better a little lie. Sometimes it is important a little lie too about the perspectives about the life too, for example about the someone's health, about the economic situation, about the reality. It is not necessary to be crude.

In my opinion, both points have their advantages and disadvantages. I will start with living at the university with other students. The first advantage that comes to my mind it's that the experience can be amusing and you will remember it for the rest of your life. Another advantage which I think it's quite interesting is the fact that you'll be forced to leave your comfort zone. Therefore you'll have to buy your own groceries, prepare your meals, do the washing and so on. However, there are some disadvantages either. For instance, your mates can lead you to an unhealthy life and you can lose your focus and as a result get bad marks in your exams. Besides, if you live out you probably will spend more money. Let's talk now about living with your family while you're studying. Firstly if you are living with your parents you'll be able to save more money. Secondly, you have more chances to be more focused in your exams for the reason that you won't have bad influences. In conclusion both options are pretty good, but if I had to choose between one of the two I would choose to live at the university with other students due to the fact that it's a more enjoyable experience.

Yesterday, my children agrued about the purpose of television. One said that it could entertain in many ways and played a vital role in modern era. However, the other insisted that it also educated peoplep in many areas. And I very appreciated it. First of all, television can entertain people. With the large number of films, game shows and news, people can be relaxed after the hard day. Almost TV programs were recreational and amused which make you laugh immediately . By that way, television is an ideal mean for you to kill the time. Moreover, TV manufacturers created some kind of smart televisions that you even play video games and sing karaoke with others. They also allow you to connect the Internet and access to social media. Therefore, television is an ideal means for entertaining. Besides, television can educate people in different areas. Many educational programs for kids was published like 'Wildlife', 'Spell with Mrs.Jenny." Moreover, there are some games shows that provide viewers with life skills. I learned a lot of ways to cook in a 'ABC's kitchen'. In conclusion, television not only entertains but also educates.

It is often said that it is important to always tell the truth, but it is ever acceptable to tell a lie? Firstly, I want to state that I agree with this phrase. As I see it, if you want to be someone who can be trusted by other people and have their confidence you have to be honest with them and no matter what tell the truth. Besides, if you are someone who normally tell lies, then you have a big chance to forget the lies you had told and therefore people will notice it and as a consequence you will lose your credibility. Although there are some cases which you can be allowed to tell a lie in order to relieve others' pain. For instance, imagine that your dog is sick and sadly he dies, so now you have to explain it to your children. Don't you think that instead of explaining them that your dog has died you could tell them that your dog has found his mother and he has gone to live with her? In conclusion, I'm one of those who tries to be honest and always tell the truth, owing to the fact that at the end you know what is real and what not and for this reason I believe that there is no point in telling lies to other people.

Hi Jack, How are you doing? I'm not bad. You can't ever imagine what I did last Saturday: I went to the concert of my favourite rock band! I like rock songs, since they are so energetic. They'd announced they were going to have a concert, but they kept location and date secret for a while. Out the blue, they said they were going to have it in my town. I was out of my mind when I heard it! I couldn't believe it! At the concert, I had such a marvelous time. Everyone was enjoying themselves. Anyway, I must dash now. Drop me a line soon, Vito

In the world there are plenty of things that must be done without any money or a course grade for example feeding an animal, fund a student or help someone who inneed. we can sequence this event more and more for that people should learn and being taught by their parents and especially by their teacher during their education. in order to avoid and prevent humans to become selfish. Parents and schools have a responsibility, therefore, if humans want to have a better future to their beings, helping each other without any respond as money or something else they should grow up children to learn how act and do some works or help people as volunteers and it starts with family then countinues in schools. Children are more open to learn things than older people therefore, during their school if they learn to help their friends as volunteers it will be a part of their life and become a habit for them. rest of their life they can be more helpful and it will gain them respect from others for example if a teacher asks students to clean their classroom or a garden which belongs to school and they always play games and do sports activities after they do it volunterily they could comprehend and recognise keeping clean their environment how important for them and the rest of other students then it will be a habit to do something beneficial for them and nature as volunteers So superficially willing may not be a behavior to earn money but insight of that is a great thing for nature and world no one knows who will need help in this life and times always changes sometime our life might turn out and we may need help that time if we have not enough money than the life would be so hard upon these people must learn and act voluntarily so that it must be taught in schools.

The W&I website is a tool I've been using for some time and as an experienced user I have some thoughts and tips that may help others. The Cambridge provided website offers access to different task levels plus a test zone. The work done is stored so we can check and try to improve a past activity at any moment, being it a good way to verify our improvement over time. As we're dealing with an AI resource - there is no teacher checking the activities, only artificial intelligence - it's essential to keep in mind that some things can look a little odd in the feedback, with moments when we're sure everything is alright, but the website keeps asking for some changes to be made. My overall opinion is that W&I is a good resource for those who want to improve their writing abilities in English with instant feedback, but knowing the tool uses AI and so some error may occur with the feedback provided. Nontheless the website can be a good learning tool as long as complemented with the habit of reading and listening to nowadays English content, so when there's a doubt about the feedback we have enough baggage to deal and decide what's right or not.

I don't like to exercise, but I have PE classes at school. So, I usually exercise four times a week. And I like exercising outside. There are many reasons for it. For example, I can take fresh air, I can communicate with neighbors, relatives, and someone, and so on. There are a variety of ways to exercise. But I like running. While I'm running, I can see the view near my house. and it can makes my feel-better. People's feeling is influenced by exercise. The exercise gives us many good things.

I have discovered "Write and Improve" randomly. It was kind of suggested to me. Anyway "Write and Improve" is really good opportunity to put your thoughts into words and to get feedback instantly. To learn a language it is important to write and to structure your thoughts. The site is structured in different levels, so you can coose the levels that suit you best. You can choose the topic about what you want to write and a requirement for word sets. After entering your text and you get a assessment and classification of your language ability. In addition you get notes on suspected errors. Which is really helpful. Furthermore you have a run chart and an overview about your language level. Which helps you to follow your development and makes your language education transparency. I can recommend this site and this kind of learning. In our school days we had the task to write and summarize a story. I think it is great way to learn a language. It is not enough to learn vocabulary or to watch a movies in your goal langugae. As I mentioned you have to put your thoughts into words and to use the new vocabulary.

If you have good health, you can easily to travel everywhere, you can easily to work on everything and some things.

Sleeping is one of the necessary things in human's life. And the sleeping place is an important factor that is directly related to your quality of sleep. In my view, I would choose to sleep in a dark and quiet room for some reasons. In a recent report by Department of Health, light will make you find hard to sleep. You will have a feeling as if there was daytime outdoor and light makes you conscious and active. So, it may take you a long time to fall asleep. Another element for a nice sleep is sound. The atmosphere around you should be peace and qiuet. Therefore, you won't be distracted by other stuffs and feel comfortable enough to be relaxed after a hard day. I recommend that you should play some instrumental music or ballad songs. They are studied to have positive effects on the qualify of humans sleep. In a nutshell, a dark and quiet room is the most ideal environment for me to sleep.

I like to sleep by being in a quiet room, but having a small light at the corner of the room because, I'm still a bit scared of the dark. When I sleep in a dark quiet place it relaxes my mind from any problems or stress that I might have during the day. When you sleep in a dark place your mind is more likely to sleep because of the lack of light, so I can have a good night's rest for the next day. That is how I like to sleep.

Having gone through a tragic and full of challenges 2020 by COVID 19 pandemic, we eventually started a new year 2021 with many hopes and promised things. I listed loads of stuff I wanted to work out. Currently, I major in English teaching at Hanoi National University of Education ,and I'm completely pleased with my area that I decided to pursuit from scratch. There is a lot of memorable experiences as well as challenges that I learned from them much. I knew how to plan the lessons, designed many detailed slides for presenting in front of bunch of people and did teamwork effectively. Besides, I still find that I'm dearth of many important skills such as outdoor activities, communication skills. They are also my weakness and the reason why I don't gain any scholarship in my first semester. But I will make an effort to improve them day by day. I will participate in one of the clubs at school and be more active when doing outside activities. At the same time, I plan to have a part-time job as a private teacher. So, I will gain more experience in my area ,and my communication skills will be enhanced. I always believe that one day, I can store enough knowledge to be expert in my area. Then, I will use all the things I learned at unniversity to help my students in their studying route.

I guess that is a problem. Nobody wants to live in the back country. After finishing such a tough study like in this case medicine, that is not easy. For a lot of students it is difficult to have access to a study, because of their financial situation. Many students have to take on debt, to pay the fee, rents and other bills. Then should those people be sent somewhere in the back country, that doesn't seem fair to me. After their study they have to invest also a lot of money in the practice, devices and equipment. There is no end of debt in sight. In addition what is also very important is social life. For singels it would be very difficult to live in the back country without a partner maybe. There might be people maybe with family they would like to live there and to enjoy the life off the city. On the other hand there are families, for them that is really important to have access to things which offer an urban city. A fair and right distrubution I guess is very difficult. It depends on needs, social situation, preferences and lifestyle, where the people decide to live. We as patients require a good treatment when we go to the doctor and therefore the doctor has to be satisfied.

Telling the truth is not always easy. However, there are situations in which a lie is preferable. Many people argue that lying is one of the worst things one can do and always telling the truth is very important. Whether I believe so as well will be discussed in the following. First of all, it has to mentioned that the legitimacy of a lie is depending on the situation. A lie is legit consider a lie as legit if nobody was badly affected. However, the importance of a certain situation has to be analysed carefully. For instance, when only once arriving delayed at school the importance of that situation would not be crucial and no one would be violated physically or mentally. Nevertheless, the danger of analysing a situation unsuitably is still existing. Furthermore, I do not recommend lying in decisive cases of life. In crucial cases of life a lie can destroy relations and worsen situations rather than heal them. Moreover, the lying person itself may not endure the burdens of distortion and may suffer even more than the person who is being lied to.

Dear I would like to write to you about the new rule that is banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I am sure that the rule is absolutely outrageous. You should not accept that suggestion. As you know, mobile phones are indispensable in our everyday life. We could not even spend just one day without it in the modern world. I know that it is annoying when someone speaks on the phone in public spaces. However, that is because they need to do it at the time. Besides, people sometimes need to use the phone in case that they were in an emergency situation. In those cases, their life and death would depend on their phone. I must say that you could not decide whether or not a person have to die. As I have written above, it is a bad idea that banning the use of mobile phone on public transport and in shops and so forth. Instead, you should just call on people to refrain from the use of mobile phones in some public spaces. Definitely, you should not ban it as that is too much. This is why I wrote this letter. I hope that the other people who think about the ban would understand my opinion. I strongly believe it to be understood. Best regards, A citizen

I would like to say that it is basically a right thing to always tell the truth. It is very important, too. People must tell the truth all the time. However, I think that there could be a moment that is acceptable to tell a lie. For example, the time to tell a joke to friends. It would be funny, and people like funny things. It makes a relationship better. Likewise, there is a time, which should not tell the truth. We have to think about the result before we speak something. If we could be offensive or rude when we tell the truth, then we should refrain from telling the truth. Thus, we are able to be socially acceptable. By the way, how about telling a lie without any reasons? I suppose that that could not be right in any situations. To tell a lie is heinous. I am sure that most people agree with me about it. I would be disappointed if someone told a lie in a callous way. I think that it is very important not to tell any lies. What is more, it is also important to trust people around you every time you see them. This is my opinion but I would like to say that people should hate someone who has no qualm about telling a lie.

I see or I think everybody has to see that healthy is better. Health has to come to the priorities of people even if you are like to be rich or anything else. The more you care about your health the more you be wealthy. The person who is making money not money makes man so you have to focus on your health to be rich. Maybe you be rich and have a lot of money but you can't spend it because you are sitting in bed or you are in hospital and that refer to all the things you did in your health. You have to do exercise every day at least three times a week even it 30 minutes but you have to keep it. Everybody has to choose the health first and if they choose money I think after a little bit of time they will be sick. They will do harmful things to their body because they preferred to be rich on be healthy. The most important thing in our life is our health so care of it to reach and achieve what you want.

It is really good to walk in the early morning because the wind is so clear and cold and it is also foggy. And I often go for a walk in the early morning during this season. It is from November to Feburary. There are many competitons that are held for the students during this season. As I like challage, it is really exciting for me.

I myself have never worked in cubicles or in offices where are no walls separating employees. I only know traditional enclosed workstations. Employees from one department sit together in these separated offices. From my experience the exchange between the employees is really good. They can share each other all experiences, knowledge and impressions during their work day. That works really good. One disadvantage is that it is difficult to meet people from other departments, except they have to work together because of a work topic. They knowledge exchange between the departments is really difficult. The risk here is that every department try to push their goals even if it causes harm to another department. This is called Silo thinking. One departments tries to improve itself at the expense of another department. That would not be good for the whole company. Therefore I like the idea with offices in which there are no walls, it seems to have a lot advantages. As always in the practice you have to be careful and to consider the company, corporate culture, region and people. It would make sense to involve the work council and the employees by planning such offices. In order to get the best results for the employees, company and the working atmosphere.

THE SCHOOL OF THE FUTURE: HOW WILL IT BE? Many people wondering how the schools will be in the future . I think that the school of the future will change in a lot of ways. The schools will be more technological than now, as the students will use computers, e-books and online sites to study and they will do a lot of lessons and activities online. The schools will be different even in their aspect because I think that they will be bigger than now, and maybe the school's workers will replace by robots. In the school of the future there are things that will be the same, such as subjects like history, foreign languages and others, because they are too important for the students. The schools maybe will not change a lot, but they will be different than now.

The boooks are heavy and need a space where you can put, while on your computer you can read a lot of books and don't take up a wole library. There are some bad aspect like take notes on your laptop. In my experience is difficult write on a digital books, more if you try to write with the mouse. Some people are worried about the damage from the lights produced by a screen. In fact, they were made some device like Kindle that they are made on purpose so as not to bother the eyes. The lights of the screen is made by side, doing this you can read for a long time and doesn't hurt your eyes. You can also read in bed without turning on the light.

In my school days I had musician lessons. I didn't like the lessons and that was definitely not my favourite lesson. I remember that we had to sing and to read notes. I am not familiar with any musical instrument. But I think that students can assess and appreciate the knowledge which they will receive form this musical lessons. Music belongs to general education and it has influence on further development. Music can stimulate our brain and has influence on our mood. Therefore it is really necessary to have an aware and basic knowledge. Nobody needs to be an expert in musican. It should be made in such a way that up to a specific grade, you have to attend this musical lessons. And then from a certain grade, you can opt out of the lessons. Every student can decide in regard to their interests, which lessons they want to take. The students should determine their school life.

The truth, is imperative. We must always tell the truth, this is not only a matter of choice this is seriously deeper, it's something spiritual. Yes, okay, I understand that you can not see what I am saying however even if you could see you wouldn't choose it. Remeber, when I said that choosing between truth and lie is something deeper and spiritual, I meant that if you decide to tell the truth you are choosing G-d otherwise when you make the opposite choice you are choosing Satan. I can't be clearer. I really know what you are thinking right now, and yes I am a christian, not a crazy one but an aware one and I am writing this down to make you aware of that. So if things are not completely clear for you now, I'll speak more openly that your life is not a simple combination of choices, it is much more, it is the outcome of your choices plus other people choices adding spiritual beings actions and their choices. The Lord wants you and one of the ways to be closer to him is telling the truth even though this is not the only thing, it is (let's say) the beginning. As I said starting this "essay," the truth is imperative. The same way I can tell all of you God is the emperor.

Learning a foreign language is nowadays more important than ever before. Especially English as the world language is important in a business and private context. Globalization as a mega trend has lead to highly complex supply chains between companies. Today companies purchase and sell their products on a global market to people and companies in every area in the world. All these transactions need to be negotiated and the language of negotiation is mostly English. As a result, most job advertisements are requiring fluent English skills from interested applicants. But fluent skills in a foreign language are also important for travelling the world. The chance to find someone in Asia who speaks German is much lower than finding someone who speaks English. To summarize, speaking a foreign language is more important than it was in the past. I would say, the more languages someone speaks, the better it is.

Dear Johnna, You have no idea where I've went last Monday. To tell you the truth, I went to a music concert in Baoli Giant Theatre, actually! March has witnessed a dramatic improvement in my career. The greatest of all was that I got promoted in my firm this term1 Given that the former HR manager was resigned for good, I sought the opportunity just in time. You understand that people're likely to ease themselves when they've just gone through a tough period,don't you? That accounted why I was heading in the music concert. Frankly speaking, my knowledge of music is rather limited. To be honest, it was not until I got to the spot that I eventually learned whose concert it was, since the tickets were booked by my boyfriend in advance. Have you ever heard about Alica Frankle's name? Representing one of the most distinguished divas in Britain, she is performing in the globe this year. Overall I regarded this concert as an more-than-fascinating one! Alica Frankle was not only a professional but also a gifted in engaging people during the two-hour concert. I was at the edge of bursting into tears when she sang the bridge of Shassas. It's was so amazing! Never should you forget about it once you hear she singing live. The concert is going to be a lifelong memory for me, definitely. Yours, Iris

Nowadays it is well known that much people are emigrating from small towns in rural areas to big cities. Therefore, we need more hospitals and doctors in the big cities for the reason that they have many patients to attend. However, the citizens who live in the rural areas are old people and they need more health care. Owing to that fact, I believe that we should invest in those areas and as a result some citizens who have emigrated to big cities will have a chance to come back to their town. As a result the population in rural areas will increase and this will lead to the creation of new hospitals. In conclusion, there aren't enough doctors in rural areas due to their lack of population. For this reason I suggest that one of the best solutions could be to invest in those areas, so we can create new jobs and this will bring more citizens in those areas and eventually they will need more doctors.

When people have the same teacher for several years they benefit from the fact that the teacher knows the student inside out and is able to see the study progress the student is making. In other words the teacher is able to monitor student's growth for a longer period. Also the teacher may relate to the students on a more personal level, enabling the teacher to more indepth understand the student. Aspects from the student's private life can more easily be understood by the teacher, through which he or she can empathize with the consequences, understand what is moving the student and help the student to overcome any unforeseen difficulties caused by circumstances during his study. On the other hand, a fresh pair of eyes will help the student to grow further. New teachers can highlight improvement points more easily because they do not know the background of the student. They are therefore able to pinpoint focus points more objectively . Each teacher brings along his or her special educational qualifications.

To my opinion, all students should be able to study music since this requires many skills and compentences which will help them in their lives. First of studying music is a great example of improving the creativity skills of students. Students will have to be creative while playing music. Creativity is one of those skills that will bring them further in life while pursuing a career. This competency will help them to anticipate to different situations under various circumstances. One other positive aspect of studying music is that it provides a way to express themselves in other ways than with words. As long as lecturers provide a safe environment in the classroom, students will be able to use music to show other students how they feel. Music can be used as way to express emotions. Furthermore playing music binds people together. Whether it is during a yam session or whether it is when studying a musical play. It is very fulfilling to accomplish an enormous task such as a difficult music piece. Being able to work in a team will have an added value in the future. Therefore I believe that all students should have access to musical studies.

There are many video games, varying from simple games such as Donkey Kong where to advanced, complex video games as real life action movies. Part of these games aim at improving the child's fine motery movements, some are designed for educational purposes and others are just for fun. The first two kinds of games have certainly positive effects on the children since they are especially focussing on improving skills in an entertaining way. This format helps kids to gain certain competencies while playing. Teachers promote these games and use them as part of the educational programme. The last category can have a negative impact on children because children might get lost in the games which are based on current situations, quite often games where the goal is to win by shooting and killing avatars which resemble characters from their lives. On the other hand some of the more advanced games are designed in such a way that they have to cooperate with other kids to achieve their goals, so a learning element exists in those games. It certainly will help to set a strict age-limit to each games, preventing young kids to lose sight from reality and to avoid them getting hurt while playing those games.

Zoos are certainly good places for people to learn about animals. Today an important task for zoos is to educate children on the wild life in general and the species living there in particular. In one of the Dutch zoos a young pandabear was born and the zoo kept viewers informed by setting up a live stream, enabling people to see how the panda was born and his experiences in the early weeks of his life, which would not be feasible under any other circumstances since people are not able to observe pandabears in the wild upclose. This is just one example of the educational tasks of a zoo, they also provide information on plants and insects living in the wild by explaining in which climate they exist and how they survive. Nowadays the zoos take well care of the animals and provide a safe environment. They duplicate the environment where the animals originate from as much as possible. Each area has all elements of the original nature environment; a variation of animals and plants and circumstances. If zoos would not exist, some animals would be distinct .

I discovered that occasionally requesting input from students is the best course of action to design the school of the future. Indeed, it can be extremely beneficial to ask students directly what they think would be most effective, as this creates a democratic and egalitarian method of learning. Doing so can also enable youngsters to take a greater level of control of their own learning process, now and in the future. Amazingly, students know exactly what they prefer as method of learning and provide great ideas to improve the current education. A great leap forward would be to involve students in designing the school of the future. By putting them in charge of designing the best way of learning, they will experience a high level of personal involvement. I had the distinct pleasure of working with some brilliant, highly focussed students who provided a clear insight into what the school of the future should look like. The main and most important change to be made in education would be to put the students in control on their own study progress and goals, to assist them in their journey, encouraging them to go the extra mile, rather than forcing them to learn via the traditional path.

Most medical doctors in order to earn more money, they prefer to work in cities than work in a small rural places or small cities and because of that rural areas are faced medical problems and lack of doctors. To solve this problem governments should make some statutes as giving more many to those doctors who work in a rural area that might encourage them and governments can decrease taxes on their salary . Moreover give them some privilages in the country as travelling cheaper than other citizens that might be a nice privilege for those doctors, because many rural areas or villages are away from cities and travelling might be high price, besides this rural areas should be developed by governments to encourage doctors to live there for example founding some sport stuffs like swimming pools, Tennis and football fields. These solutions could be helpful for doctors to spend their leusire times who have no claim to work in a village or a rural place. So if doctors desire more money to work, so that, increasing their salaries might be a solution besides other privilages.

Languages are the skills that people can communicate with each other. Learning is the thing that everybody has to own and always be update their knowledge. Learning new languages besides it is beneficial is one of the important things in the world because it is never old fashion it will always have its position. As much as you learn a new language as long as you are proud of yourself and break a new ground. The more you learn the more you keep digging into your knowledge. So it will never be old, Language is dying when all of the people who are talking it die. There is a wonderful quote for Nelson Mandela that said “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” I think everybody has to learn at least a new language besides his native language that's open a lot of new opportunities for him. He also can travel to the country where people talk about it.

Dear Jason, Glad to hear from you soon! Exicited that a movie festival is to be held in your campus, I literally have a fascinating one to suggest-----The Social Network. As is widely known, the movie was adapted from the storyline of Mark Zuckerburg and the process of how he and his friends created Facebook. Just like other adaptive films, TSN did a good job in keeping the balance between drama and reality. That is to say, you can see the traditional American style of films, which is filled with sex, conflicts as well as strict plot. At the same time, there also stood the reflections of what had happened to the characters in the reality. What I found most thrilling when watching the movie was the engrossing acting by two male actors, Jesse and Andrew. As for Jesse, who acted as Mark in TSN, he never failed to attract every audience with his high-speed lines as well as delicate facial expressions. I almost cried out"That's Zuckerburg alive" when he typed in an incredibly fast rhythem on the keyboard. Needless to say, Andrew was the one who dedicated his heart and soul to his character Edurado. Playing as Mark's best friend, Edurado had gone through a series of tough times when they started their career. Notwithstanding, Andrew's Edurado was a "sweetheart" from head to toe, as he's always there for his mate. Released almost ten years ago, TSN was a phenonmenal blockbuster as well as a box-office hiter. It's the kind of film that you surely don't want to miss. That's why I highly recommend it to you. I sincerely hope you can enjoy it. Yours, Iris

I think that it is a better to live on their own when they are attending school. Generally, most of the students live at home with their family and depend on them about living things. It is not bad for students, however living by themselves will give them advantages in the future. I have two points about my idea. First of all, living by ourselves develop our living skills. There are many things to live like washing, cooking, cleaning and so on. Then, at home, we probably rely on our families, especially our mothers. But, if we live by ourselves, no one does them without us. And, most of the students will go out their home and live alone when they begin working in society. So, living on their own while they are students will be preparation of their future lives. Secondly, students can make a time to do something efficiently better than living at home with their families. For example, at home, when we want to go to the bathtoom, if other family member already have been doing, we have to wait for finishing it. This may be a little thing in a daily life, but it also breaks our plan in the day. If we live alone, we can decide when we go to the bathroom and it makes it easier to make a plan in a day. While we are students, there many things to do such as studying, working part-time job and so on. So, in order to use time flexibly, living alone is very effective for students. All in all, I described two points about preparation for the future and using time effectively. Living by ourselves while we are students is so difficult and hard. But, it will give us good effect definitely.

My experience with Write and Improve. I started using it 1 month ago more or less and I have to say that I believe that is a quite useful tool to improve my writing skills. One of my favourite things of this page is that it has many different types of writing to choose, for instance you can write an informal letter and then a formal essay. Besides I find quite helpful the variety of levels that the website provides. Within the website you can find the following levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. However, I'm not so happy with the automatic corrector, for the reason that sometimes it can misunderstand some of your words. In conclusion, as I see it Write and Improve it's a wonderful tool if you want to train your written skills and therefore I would recommend it to everyone who want to acquire a better English.

After having done some body exercises with my class, I getting used to the idea that this is one of the best way to keep our body in shape and in good health. Even if the time you spend time in doing body exercises, you are supposed to improve not only your physical health but also the mental one. Some of them are aimed to strenghen your upper limbs, other are perfect for legs or back. The variety of exercises is quite large and most of them come from U. S., however some American researches have shown that a body exercises-based lifestyle, is not the only way to take care our health. What the statistics suggest to us is that we should keep track of our food habits. All of us should eat a great deal of fruit and vegetable as a way to avoid breathing difficulties or blood pressure problems. Some rubbish food we are used to eat, is nowhere near as genuine as we are recommend to do. Just let me to be a little ironic: every rubbish food restaurant should be cordon off, no one car should pull over to them.

I would like to live a long, calm life, definitely. It would be better rather than that having a shorter life, even if that would be much more intense. I would like to explain the reasons why I think so. First of all, I like a tranquil life very much. I always tend to avoid the noisy places because of that. Generally, I do not like to talk to people. If anything, I would prefer to read books or something like that. Although I like to listen to people who are talking. Besides, a long life would give me more opportunities to get various experiences. I have a lot of things that I would like to do. To do so, I must live for as a long time as possible. If you do not have much time to live, then what could you achieve in such a short time? However, in spite of that I wrote as above, I agree that the intensity is important to some extent. Even if I could live for a long time, it would be boring when I could not do anything. It is reasonable that some people do not hesitate to do dangerous things, because they want to do so. On balance, I could not say which is better. But I would just choose a long life. Not to mention, a long, intense life would be the best.

Some people argued that students should not have to study music in school. However, I'm against that idea for some reasons. First of all, it is undeniable that music is an effective entertaining way. As far as I'm concerned, nowadays students have to learn a huge amount of knowledge with loads of academic subjects. That leads to their high study pressure and overwhelming by trillion of theories in many areas. Therefore, if there are music classes in their schedule, it will reduce students's stress and make their brain less tense. Music is proved to have some health benefits including enhancing the memory and ability to concentrate. Moreover, the soft melody created by music instuments can help them to calm down, soothe their soul. It tends to decrease the risk of conflicts between irritated students. Music also develops students's artistic talents. By learning to play musical instruments, their sense of art is more subtle and delicate. In coincidence, it improves the right brain of learners. As a result, students can become more creative and be interest in art area. For students that have talent in music at the beginning, they maybe gain some useful experience and soon be expert in their pursuing of music career. For the rest, it's likely some of them will find out their passion for music. Then, they direct their action to become musicians, instrumentalist or even singers. From the above benefits of music, I think that this subject should be taught at school. It can make the significant change in students's life.

In many less populated areas, there is a lack of doctors as a huge number of its are moving to cities. Most medical doctors want to move to town because there are more opportunities to find a stable job such us nurse and others hospital workplace. Indeed, in urban areas there are more places to work, due to health centres in metropolis are bigger than the countryside health centres. Furthermore in populated zones, for some kind of doctors such as physician, phsicologist and dentist is easier to find clients because they work in areas that are more populated and where there is more density of people. For instance a dentist who works in city have more opportunity to have a regular client rather then a rular medic. To resolve these problems small town and county should try to search for more volunteers like medic students for work in their infirmary. Be a clinician in a big town is easier, but is important to have more doctors in rular areas.

Health is more important than wealth It is known proverb that "health is wealth." We know human progress have been changing and it will continue but sayings and proverb do not change. We must say that health is the greatest wealth. In other words, we can enjoy our money and property when we are healthy. A sick person is not able to enjoy his wealth in a proper way, he needs a healthy body to be happy. We have wealthy and poor countries around the world. When we see "happy index" it does say that only wealthy countries are happier. In fact, a poor country like Bhutan has number one place at happy index, its people are happier than other countries and its people. Bhutan has not a proper government, but Bhutan has king and its kingdom govern the country. Similarly, we can notice at rural and urban area of a country in general. And we find that people in the villages are healthy than those who are living in cities. And cities provide much more facility to its people. Above the information says that health is more important than a wealth for a happy and prosperous life.

Nowadays, people argued about the importance of a good health compared to that of being rich. In my view, I suppose that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Firstly, a good health is considered as the most valuable treasure of each person. When you are healthy, you have loads of energy to do anything you want. You can climb up the steep mountains, run fast in the windy hills and do some extreme sports without being limited. Moreover, with a good health, you will work productively. A strong farmer can do as twice as a weak one. Similarly, a white-collar worker who does exercise every day is able to work overtime and usually active in their work. Sadly, some people is self-confident their strength and then make full of it to earn for living. They maybe become a millionaire but in the long run, they will pay the heavy toll by their health. The money they earned will be used for pay the hospital bill instead of travelling all around the world and spending time with family members. In conclusion, I put the health first and invest in my health for further benefits in the future.

Computers and tablets should not fully replace books in schools and universities. Books are unique source of education and knowledge in schools and university. Those institutions are colourless without books. To imagine students without books is impossible. Books are original source of our classics and literatures that has given to human a lot. Books are as important as computers and tablets are for us. We can use them for different places and purposes, neither can completely replace for another. It is like someone can manage his work with one hand and he should delete the other hand. Just like we need various types of vehicles to travel, and everyone has its importance in life.

The statement for today is: It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. And I think that is definitely true. My health is very important for me. I can't be rich if I don't have a job. And I can't have a job if I am not healthy enough. Unless you have a rich dad and he gives you everything you want. But my dad isn't rich. I have to work to become rich. And if you want to work, so you can become rich, you have to have a good health. Otherwise your boss won't hire you. I think that when you are healthy, you are also happier. At least I am, and I hope you are to. Money isn't the most important thing when you are healthy and you have friends and family. A person who isn't rich, can be happy too.

It's a common belief that learning to speak a foreign language has positive impact on our life. And I think that it's more crucial in the 4.0 industry than it was in the past. Firstly, learning foreign languages will meet the great demand for communication of people. We are living in the modern world where people easily interact with others through the continients thanks to the invention of Internet in 1969. Besides, the need for travelling and trading is one of the reasons bring people together. So, learning new languages helps people whose culture is different easily understand each other. By that way, it is more and more necessary than in the past when people couldn't afford travelling or exchanging things with foreigners. Moreover, today we have a new notion- global citizens; it is the idea that one's identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity." Therefore, the priority is that they have ability to speak more than two languages. Then, they can do their work and make a contribution to the development of their countries. Today, English is considered as a global language and Chinese is the most spoken language in the world. So, it's likely be your strrength if you learn either of them.

Nowadays it is well known that computers and tablets are winning popularity over the students and teachers. However, I'm one of those who believe that we shouldn't remove the books. I agree that computers have many perks, for instance with them we can search for information with just a few clicks, and the sources of information we have on the internet are almost endless. Nevertheless, these perks can be at the same time disadvantages. It has been shown that computers and tablets can reduce our capacity of attention, for example many students use to spend most of their time on social applications such as Facebook and Instagram. Due to this I think that books are still useful for students because with them we normally are more focused and therefore we can learn more. I have to say that in some lessons the In conclusion, even though I believe that computers are vital for the schools and universities, we should keep using the books for some lessons.

Studying abroad has advantages as well as disadvantages. The main advantage is that students have the opportunity of exploring other cultures while pursuing their studies abroad. Learning about other cultures is a real surplus in the nowadays multicultural society, this will with no doubt be a big advantage during their future careers. They will learn about the cultural background and differences, will learn how to relate to other cultures, certainly skills they wouldn't have been able to develop during a study in their own country. Another advantage is that if a student decided that studying abroad is an option, than multiple qualified universities and available degree programmes are available to choose from. Studying in a foreign country will also be a big asset on their resumees. The biggest disadvantage is, while focussing on their studies, the students will also have to take care of their of their own household, while at the same time live in a foreign country, not aware of the cultural differences, which might cause problems and probably being able to make them selves understood because they do not master the foreign language yet. Studying abroad will, if you are not eligible for a grant, be far more expensive than studying at home. Several types of grants are available to students and it might be worthywhile to explore the possibilities before deciding in which country you want to continue your studies. Living in another country makes it also more difficult to find a suitable parttime job to support yourself during your studies.

First of all studying is one of the most things if you go to a country that has a good education. Let me talk about the advantages that you will get a wonderful education and you will choose what you want to study. I mean there is not a degree that will limit your college or high school study. You will see a new country, place, culture and things that you have never saw it before. New friends, you will meet your mates you will have new relations friendship. I think of one all these that you will get some of freedom because your parents, friends, the whole family and that will not make you shy to do anything but I mean a good things. Disadvantages will be that you are in a different country and there are a lot of things new to you and maybe you will don't like it but you have to deal with it. If you will sick one day you will be alone without any one in your family and that the most worst one. The fee of the studying maybe will be expensive so you have to decide before you travel to any country and put your plan. The bottom line that is the studying abroad is good if you money and plan to where, which you will choose.

Many workplaces are enormous and they have not any kind of barrier in it. Others offices instead are small place for work, with barriers and without communication from workers. In my opinion big offices are more effective than small offices because you have more possibility to communicate with other people. Workplaces with an open design are better for coworking as you can communicate with your team. Instead, you can ask advice to someone and you can share your point of view about the work you are doing with your colleagues. For instance if you are wondering about a thing in your work, you can ask someone for help. In addition big workrooms are places where you can know more people that are inspirational for you, and they could help you giving you some advice. Big workplaces are better because you have more possibility with other people to work and to exchange ideas.

Some students, to obtain their degree have to do a certain number of hours of volunteer work. I think that this requirement is crucial for students, as for they, it is a first approach with the world of work. For instance if a student is confused about his future, with volunteer work he can understand which is the best way for him . In addition volunteer work is an important experience to do because students show and demonstrate if they are ready to do a real job. Indeed with this hours of practice, schools understand if they are ready for being graduate or not. For example if a student do not complete the hours of volunteer work the school means that he is not ready for the degree. Volunteer work is important for students as first approach to real job and it is also a good experience for clarify ideas about work.

Nowadays, some things have already been changing. The way to teach is different to the way when I was a child. We are living in a multicultural society, so everybody has the same opportunities to learn everything about their original religion. This is the reason why we can overhearing people talking in different language. It won't be a problem in the future. We may use a small device fit in our ear to translate all the conversations. Furthermore, we will have a micro-chip inside our skin and our fathers or teachers will be able to know where we are. In the future, the most popular language will be Chinese. Therefore, if you want to learn a new language, you should start with it. I'm sure the classes in the future will be mayority online. Nowadays we are living a lockdown period and we are learning how can work from our house. The way to teach in the future will be also change. Pupils will study at home, watching videos and video-conference and giving their opinions about them. I don't know if we will be better.

Some programs require knowledge about different skills. For instance, "Pasapalabra." It is a competition to win lots of money. However, the participants must study a lot if they want to win the quiz. They have to discover which is a word with a definition of it and a clue: the first letter of it. I think it is so useful and educational like the wheel of fortune. You can also learn to cook or sew a garment. Nevertheless, there are some programs which, in my opinion, are rubbish. That kind of program is showing how a couple plays with their relationship. Many people are watching them. However, I think this type of program isn't educational. You may watch a film or series about a history of a country, so you can learn a lot, or you will be able to watch a crime film with a lot of violence and blood. We need to look after our children. Television could be educated, but sometimes not.

So you probably remember that my favourite Disney film is the Hunchback of the Notredame, since I might have repeated that way too much the last time we spoke. I think you should really watch it, because it is extremely awesome. For one, the songs just hit you right where it hurts. I cry almost every time I hear 'Heavens Light' and I get overly dramatic when I hear and sing along to 'Hellsfire'. Another point is that the characters are very well rounded. They show real human emotions such as love, lust and envy. And even though Quasi might be in love with Esmeralda, he also sees that she is in love with Phebus, and he with her, so he leaves them be even though it breaks his heart to see them together.

Last Summer, I had the distinct pleasure of spending time in Italy and looking back, I recogn it turned out to be the best holiday ever. Since Italy is a 1600 km drive, we always spend the night near Lugano Lack, luckily for us there was still a room available at one of our favorite hotels where we enjoyed the top quality service of this very charming, yet very traditional hotel, commonly known for its famous visitors like Audrey Hepburn. The second day, we arrived at the camping in Tuscany, the sun was shining and the temperature already had risen to a very comfortable 30 degrees. Unpacking was done very quickly so that we could settle in the sun and start planning our sightseeing tours in the surroundings. One of the highlights was the visit to the waterfall in the beautiful rural neighbourhood of Florence. We walked alongside the waterfall and were very much impressed by the amazing nature, all kinds of plants were flourshing and the colours of the flowers were brilliant for taking photos. The other unforgettable moment was our visit to Cita del la Pieva, an ancient village with stunnishing views. We loved walking along the small streets, enjoyed the best espresso ever on one of the small, romantic squares while thinking about other things to be discovered in this very romantic village.

Dear Mollet del Valles council, I write you regarding the news about banning the use of mobile phones on some spaces, I disagree with this new proposal, first of all for the reason that I believe we should have the freedom to decide if we want to use our mobile phones in shops or restaurants, therefore it isn't a matter that the council can decide for us. Secondly, due to the fact that nowadays many people need their mobile phones for their work. For instance, let's imagine that someone who works as a stock brocker goes out to have lunch at a restaurant, however he is not allowed to use his mobile phone while he is eating and suddenly one of his stocks goes abruptly down. He couldn't notice it because he hadn't their phone and now he has lost a lot of money. Therefore, I would like to give a suggestion: The council could create advertisements in order to warn the citizens about the disadvantages of mobile addictions. As I see it, it is a less aggressive action, which gives the freedom to the citizens to choose. In conclusion, it is true that we spend too much time in front of our electronic devices, nevertheless we should have the liberty to choose if that is how we want to spend our time or not.

Dear Makenzie, How are you? I went to a music concert last week, and it was so great, so I couldn't wait to share mu experience with you. You know me well, so you know that I love music because music can make me feel relaxed. I had a really hard time last week due to many exams to take. As a consequence, I decided to go to a music cencert for relaxing. Another reason I went to the concert was that I love playing the piano, and this concert was performed by a young pianist for Germany. A pianist from Germany was performing. I couldn't spell his name because it was too long and complicated. Nevertheless, I could recognize him among people, because he looked very handsome and tall, and he was very elegant. Perhaps it was because the classical music that made him so gorgeous. He was also very polite. He greeted me outside the theatre when I was waving my hand excitedly for seeing him. I really enjoyed music during the concert, but there was something annoying. Many people was late for the concert, so there were many figures moving to find seats while I was listening to the first piece of music. What's more, there were some kids in de theater. Maybe Thae was because their parents want them to get to know more about classical music. Nevertheless, kids could hardly know about classical music, and they couldn't understand the meanings of the music. It was really tough for them to sit on the chair for over two hours without screaming and crying. These made the experience not so comfortble. I don't really think we should allow children below 10 years old to enter the concert, because they may ruin a precious journey with music. I also think we shouldn't allow people who are late to enter the concert. They have to take their responsibilities for not being punctual. What do you think about my thoughts? Although many unecpected things happened, I was still satisfied with this concert. I definitely aprrieciate the performance. The pianist was quite technical and talented. I hope that I can play the piano as well as he did in the future. I hope everything is going well on you, and I hope we can go to a concert together when I go to the USA next year. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, Joany

I think the school of the future will be fairly different than the schools we have today. All most the time students will take their own track to learn something new. The teachers will work to show the pathway to students and make they don't get lost. Maybe the students will work with specific topics, for instance, rather a student has a gift to work with exact sciencies he will focus on it. And over time, this student acquires specific knowledge in a given subject. I think some courses would disappear and others will emerge like coding, and other topics related to computers as artificial intelligence as well. Some things won't change, for example, interaction betweenchildren, they need to develop their social skills or soft skills. And human contact is essential to the children develop it.

I firmly believe that living a separate house in the young days triggers your new life, which you appreciate in the future. This idea is held up by my past experiences. In the adolecence period, to be emotionally stable, young college students build a firm network they want to belong to instead of relying on their parents all the time. This sense of belongings accelerates their mental growth because they play a role in its community aside from a child. They will be mentally independent and responsible not for their lives but also their communities. In my case, I stayed in a student dorm and interacted with a lot of colleagues in different majors. This whole experiences made me who I am. Said that, some people still stress that living at home is cost-efficient and comfortable to focus on the studies. I would oppose this idea in two reasons. One is that it is true to save your money if you can go to university from your parents’ house but is the cheaper cost true reason why you wanted to attend the university? Apparently you may go though more hardships than you imagined yet these challenges you encounter would be a medicine to intensify your growth. The younger you are, the better it is to take through a variety of experiences. The second reason is that if you cannot manage your time by yourself without any family support, you will suffer a new life after working in a companey. To grow yourself, you should stand your own two feet even from the college days.

The Future of Travel changed with the arrival of the COVID19 virus and the challenging facing us with regard to the environment. More than ever, people were faced with the most challenging and only question regarding travelling ever; is it a luxury just for the rich people or a common thing which ordinary people can enjoy as well. COVID19 prohibited people from travelling beyond the borders, all kinds of belts and braces were put in place to keep people at home. Crossing borders was not allowed during the outbreak of the virus, moreover it had been forbidden by national governments to prevent the virus from spreading unnecessarily any further than it already did. Travelling was only possible within the frontiers of the country. So maybe, the future of travel is travelling is not getting onto a plain for a far-away vacation, experiencing other cultures and nature, but staying close to home, exploring the neighbourhood and revisiting all the little gems in the local area surrounding us. Future will tell if people will ever be able to travel long distance again or that it will be forbidden for ever. Utlimately, less travelling will have a beneficial effect on nature , because travelling in itself will be burdening and have a major impact on the environment. So maybe the limitations set by the virus will in the end have a positive effect on people as well as the environment.

Since the insurance companies play an important role in setting rules for medical practices, it because more and more difficult for a medical doctor to run his business at a profit. The insurance companies setting strict rules, prevent medical doctors of being creative on treating their patients in the best way they know how. Each treatment has his own set of limitations as to what a medical doctor may offer in a certain amount of time. And in the end, it is all about business. Rural areas often represent a particular low number of habitants, whereas medical practices need as much patients are possible, enforcing medical doctors to set up their practice in large cities instead of small villages. Moreover, a small village, however charmingly pittoresk and attracting, does not offer enough patients and are in such a way extremely challenging to entrepreneurs who in general want to develop a successful business.

In recent years, there has been a heated debate on whether the college students should be forced to physical activities due to the fact that because of the heavy effects of modernization and industrialization, it is increasingly hard for them to keep a reasonable balance between stressful schoolwork and physical and psychological wellbeing. While some hold a firm belief that it is doubtless for schoolers, who may be too busy to distribute some of their time and energy to physical exertion, I, to a large extent, maintain that only by taking regular exercise, be it jogging or swimming, can students enojy a precious opportunity to pursue more rounded development as well as enhanced academic performances. In this essay, I would like to quote a few examples to support my opinion. To begin with, generally speaking, exercising can absolutely release ourselves from feeling stressed and suffocated, which caters for both our physical needs and psychological pursuits. What I mean by this is that under such many fierce competitions both on and off campus, it is rather important to keep fit to ensure the success of our academic grades, which benefits us undoubtedly and offers us valuable opportunities enlarging our merits and edges over other candidates for further would-be competitions. Therefore, it is of great necessity to guarantee our exercise on a daily basis. Why not start from now! In addition, in many cases, as is known to all, making end meets has been increasingly difficult for adults, especially when the entire world has been suffering from financial recession brought about by the COVID-19 for an extended period of time. It therefore seems more essential to every individual, scholars in particular, to be in decent health only physically but also mentally to prevent them from being bombarded by bills of different operational costs and daily consumption accordingly. As an old saying goes, “Health ensures the success of the revolution”, for which plenty of evidence can be found. To sum up, while tertiary education is allowed to enact and enforce a number of specific regulations about exercising, including compulsory PE classes, which might seem to be a bit cruel somehow, I am still convinced that it is our capability and responsibility to follow them, as they could make us more effective and efficient. Ideally, university students ought to start to move about and stay away from an inactive lifestyle.

It is well known that television entertains, but there are doubts as to whether television educates or not. On the one hand we use the television to have fun, relax and entertain in different ways and we spend a lot of time in front of it. In the other hand, educations experts has been trying to solve this question for so long - Does the television educate? I'm not totally sure about it, but I know I have been watching television to learn things for a long time. There is lots of educational channels available for a wide range of ages, from 1 to 99 years. The major problem is all most of the time people don't use the television as they should do. Mostly children and teenagers, they need to be supervised while they watch television as part of an educational program. Even adults have to deal with the desire to watch entertainment programs on television, rather than an educational program. In short, I think people can use the television to educational purpose.

Nowadays, a lot of students are getting unhealthy because their inactive lifestyle. That makes some people say all students at school or university should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. In my opinion, I think their thought is reasonable and I will use ma passage to explain why. There are several reasons for my opinion. To begin with the most important one, from the research of Cambridge University those students who have sports activities daily can actually have a brighter future than the others. It is very easy to understand their research, those people who have daily sports not only have a health body, but also have a spirit of never give up,which means they will have more chances in their future than others. Secondly, there are two kinds of students------- those people like sports and those people don't like sports. For the first type, their schools or universities don't need to force them do weekly sports activities. But for another type, it is necessary for their schools and universities to force them do weekly sports activities. Because if their schools or universities not force them, they will never do some sports activities that can cause a bad influence in their health. Last but not least, do sports activities can bring us a lot of positive effects. On one hand, do daily sports activities can make us healther. On the other hand, it can also make us have a wonderful social life. For example, you can make a lot of new friends when you are having sports activities, which can make you a better personality. By the way, when you are doing sports activits, you can gain lots of precious memories that you can recall someday in the future. To summarize, students should have daily sports activities. Our schools or universities should force their students if it is necessary.

There is a question of our behavior to our own life, would you prefer a long calm life or a short intense life? Everyone has their own answer for this question. In my opinion, a short intense life is better than a long and calm life. There are several reasons for my opinion. To begin with the most important one, from a research of Cambridge University those people who have intense life are actually can have a better life than the others. They explain it with a theory, the personality of those people who have an intense life are more positive, they know what to do when something suddenly happen. Secondly, from my point of views, a long calm life means a boring life. But life should be exciting, which means people are wasting their life if they spend everyday doing the same thing. By the way, although those people who in calm life can live a long life, when their old they won't have anything to recall. Last but not least, an intense life maybe is short, but it will make you feel refreshing every day. For example, you can make new friends every day or experience new adventure normally. If you have intense life, on one hand, you can fill your own life with a lot of valuable memories. On the other hand, when you are old there will be lots of things for you to recall. To summarize, an intense life is better than a calm life, even intense life are always short.

In holidays or in the week-end, an outing to the zoo is always welcomed. But are zoos suitable places for the animals kept inside ? Wouldn't it be smarter and wiser to leave them in the nature? I would say it depends. Indeed, nowadays the wild life is increasingly threatened. The main reasons to the dramatic plummet of the different types of animals on Earth is poaching, mass breeding, trafics and destruction of the ecosystems . But the listing is far from being complete, and wild life today has nothing to do with the variety we could have observed 50 to 100 years ago. And that's where the zoos can act -in a good way. By providing the animals a living environment, obviously much smaller than the one they would have had in wild nature, but much safer for them and their offspring, zoos are helping to preserve a wide variety in the fauna. Therefore, zoos can be an excellent way to preserve wild life. Besides, by showing them off to the public, everyone can learn about them and be sensibilized to their protection. As long as the world will stay as it is currently, there's no way we could return those animals to natur. It is true that they belong to the wild environment, but nature is no longer safe enough for them, whatever say the ecologists who would like them released - and therefore delivered to human madness and to death.

In this modern society, the rate of chronic patients gradually increases every year, which represents there are more and more human unhealthy. Why does this situation happen? It can attribute to the irregular daily routine and sleep schedule. According to the investigation, the data demonstrated that office workers are under a lot of pressure at work, and in their leisure time, they prefer to veg out in front of the TV rather than do exercise. It is a malignant cycle; therefore, more and more scientists promote exercise which can help you in shape and healthy. In my viewpoint, I concur to force students to participate in the PE class. First, healthy habits should be cultivated in childhood. Schools can teach students correct concepts about diet and sport. This type of knowledge can be applied in their whole life. Consequently, when growing up, they understand how to take care of themselves and maintain a regular daily routine. When entering late adulthood, they can prevent severe diseases and enjoy jubilant retirement. Second, the purpose of having sports activities is not only healthy but also sound development of the body. When doing exercise, individuals ought to acquire how to control perfectly their bodies to meet up the standard. This is extremely significant for children, for they are supposed to gain the rules of each item, which can enhance the development of the brain. Finally, having PE class can make students experience a diversity of sports. These kinds of encounters can't obtain from the book. Besides, when playing games, they enroll in how to coordinate with others, how to confront failure, and how to make use of strategy, and so forth. These advantages are useful in life. To sum up, forcing students to do sports activities is all benefits without harm. It can not only reduce diseases but also increase longevity.

To whoom it may concern, I am writing this letter to tell you my ideas and my opinion about banning mobile phones from shops, restaurant and public transport, and why I think that it is not a good idea . The banning of the use of mobile phones from shops , restauraunt and public transport is a tremendous disadvantage for the people who work with smartphones such as: social media managers , vloggers and influencers . Indeed without a mobile device they cannot do their job and I think that this is unrespectful for them . The second reasons which for banning mobile devices in public places is not a good idea is because mobile phones are one of the most useful things to communicate with people, especially when you are alone, in a place that you do not know, or if you have to meet a friend and you do not know where it is . The last reason , is that mobile devices, and especially smartphones are very helpful in dangerous situation , as with them you can call immediately someone to help you, like police or hospital .

I agree with your decision to implement a new municiple rule to profibit using a mobile phones in public places as a part of amendments approved in the council in this month. Some people may cast a doubt on why suddenly this restriction on using mobile phones are put in place. However, after seeing immoral behaviors in so many public places, I am on your side. It is because immoral behaviors in trun causes a fliction or a lawsuit between the people in our town. This trend was suprising to me, to be honest, because I believed that our people living in this town could live a life without a specific rule in a mobile phone usage. Yet, the reality was in contrast. I found a lot of cases in last year just to argue an offensive behavior triggered by mobile phone usage. To protect our life, this implementation should be welcomed by all of us. Said that, one suggestion from my side is to launch a new educational programme for everyone to digest what is morral behavior in the public spaces and what isn't as an example via video streeming service. While it takes time to penetrate this common understanding on how to use a mobile phone in the public place, I strongly consent that educational programme prevent our future conflicts in mobile usage, for sure.

For this special event, we had first class musicians and singers performing in front of us: the London orchestra and famous singers from all around the world.

I think that students are having the same teacher is better than having a new teacher each year. I'm going to explain my opinion with four reasons. First of all, I can become familiar with the teachers. So, I can ask questions more easily. I can be able to speak without nervousness. I think it is good for students. Second, having the same teachers is good for the feeling of the teachers. The teacher can easily to become familiar with school. Then, the teacher will be able to relax at school. Therefore, the teacher can teach students better. It's linked with making students better. The student's feelings are influenced by the teacher's feelings. So, caring for the teacher is an important part of caring for the students. Last, if I am unknown about the teachers, I have to begin the class with introducing. But If I know about the teachers I can begin the lesson without introducing myself. That means that I can start studying each subject as soom as possible. Start studying early is making students more genius. Having the same teacher gives good benefits for the students and the teacher. I realize that moving teachers may have better points too. But because of these reasons, I think having the same teacher is better.

As my conclusion, depending on the situation, telling a lie is acceptable instead of forbidding to lie for the entire life. The reason why I think so is coming from my personal experience. When I was 18 years old, I bumped into a robby in a doom street. I was threthen by a knife and asked whether you had enough money or not. On the spot, I suddenly told a lie not to be captured and harmed. I pretented to be a jobless guy wondering whether I could find a food and a clothing. I told him to give ten dollers as I picked it up in the street today as a mercy. Fortunately, I was safe because of my wittey lie coming across to my mind. If I were to be persistent in a principle not to tell a lie to others or less flexible, I may get injured or captivated. Of course, on the daily occasions, keep telling a lie to others deminishes your trust in the end. Hence, it should be better to refrain from a lie even on a tiny matter as a habit. Yet, if you are in a crisis, I would strongly recommend you to be agile and tell lies if needed for your safe. My experience might be extreme but the intent of quoting this example is to stress that telling a lie justifies your end depending on the situations.

This is the age of computers where tablet and computers are an important part of our life. Above all for young people living in a digital world. Schools for teaching can't do without computers and tablet, but old books have again a function at this time. I think that for some purposes books are again a useful tool. For others better to use digital books. For example to study and learn on a tablet or a computer could be more difficult than to study on a book. Computers could bring distractions and reading is not the same experience. Thanks to computers and tablet there isn't paper waste anylonger, which is an awesome contribute to save trees.

Learning English is very important and I tell you why. All around the world can speak English. English is the famous language in the world. I have been learning English for 20 years. I had studied at school as a small boy. I do not know when I think I was 8 years old. We had a great teacher for English. At the grammar school we have a lot of teachers and our level went down. One year we have four teachers, yes, a lot of changes. Then I learnt alone. I was teaching myself. Everyone would learn English for your life. My reason was better job. Everyone can study what wants.

Good Morning Miss Town, I heard a few days ago that you and your council were thinking about a new law that was banning phones and all digital devices in public transport, restaurants and shops. I think it can be, at first, a good idea if people in the city wrote a letter about that law to see their opinions, so I begin with my idea. I don't think that banning digital devices in those public places are a good idea because, these digital devices are important for the life of today, if people don't have their phones in public transport, they cannot receive the message that say that their mother is dead (for example), they won't know that, and, when they will go out of the bus, they will see that there is a problem. If people cannot use their MP3, they will be obligated to hear the cries of babies, the discussions of people that you don't want to hear. Secondly, if people don't use digital devices in public places, what will they do, they won't speak with anyone, they won't do anything, evn if it is being bored by the life in public places. I see a lot of people that work on their phones, that do important things on their phones, so I think that banning digital devices isn't a good idea. I hope you will read my letter, I hope you will like it, and I hope it will make you change your decision about that difficult one that I think I cannot answer because I think I don't have the resources. Good luck for this decision, this law and thank you for your attention. Kind regards

Welfare states like mine provides a free healthy assistance for basic cures: but if you need something more serious, and you live in a small town surrounded by mountains or away from a big city, can be hard finding a doctors who you need, or a hospital with the right tools for you. This is the result of a transiction of the funds, that was increased to build up few efficient hospitals, against the reduction of the resources for small first aid center. About private medical doctors, the argument is the same: an office in a town with few thousands of inhabitants is not as profitable as one in a big city, so, if from one side is necessary to have a healthy assistance everywhere you live, on the other side a doctor chooses to work where there is increased earning potential. The government, in my opinion, have to find a way to keep enough doctors and tools equally divided on his territory, because the entire population has the same right to receive assistance properly.

In the last few years there was an increasing number of cubicles, with just the space for desk, personal computer and phone: this solution was thought to guarantee more privacy for every worker, and probably was a good idea by the engineers. A research made by a group that observes the workers conditions, in fact, discovered that an open space reduces effectively the interaction each other, maybe because the mind feels difficult to exchange information with a colleague when all the other can see and hear your discussion. I think that an open design office is more suitable just for particular jobs, such as architects, or events like meetings and courses. In a daily routine, when each employee has his task to develop, the cubicle is the better solution, with right breaks and a time to socialize personally with the other colleagues. This is my opinion, even if there could be examples against my theory.

Hi friend, My favourite film is The Big Short. The Big Short is a film of comedy and drama. This film is about the financial crisis of 2008. The film tells how the financial crisis of the housing bubble occurred, from the causes to consequences of the recklessness of the finance market and his agents. His story is told through four characters who invested against the housing market at the time. I believe that the film will please my friend, and also incentive him to know about the finance market.

I belong to the group of people who aren't able to plat any instrument, unfortunately: said that, I agree with all students could have a chance to study music and playing a musical instrument. In my opinion if a student has a talent in this field, must have the tools to develop it, as a talent in some sport or using a computer for example: music is an important part in almost every life, and the school is the exact time when you can discover if you will be just a listener, at the radio or similar, or a music-maker, as singer or player in a group. The school has an important role for everyone: if it is possible, must guide each teenager through his best future, according to his skills, and where is not possible, it has at least to have tried it. Summarizing, every student should have to study music.

In my green age there was to join mandatory the Army for about one year (the so-called compulsory conscription). Obviously is an imperfect comparison, but this old rule often resulted in more sense of responsibilities in the behaviour of the young boy. On the same way, I am absolutely agree with the volunteer work during high school, because t can improve the social relations, physical skills and the sense of belonging at a community, as classroom as the town where the student is. There is already some teenage that practices volunteer work himself, often following the example of his parents, but I think the school plays a better role to give a civic sense to the future generation: and according to my personal experience, this is an age where you accept some rules only if they are necessary for your target to achieve, like a degree or simply to finish earlier the school period.

Doing volunteering work is an amazing way for students to learn skills on the ground and have a first experience in a work environment. It shows the university that the candidate is motivated and has a desire to work in a specific field. For example, if you wish to build a career in the Organization/ volunteering/ donation you'll need many years of volunteering to get access to the position you're looking for. It will give the student an understanding of the job and the ability to work and understand the task asked. Volunteering may lead to an internship and a job offer, so it should be taken seriously. I haven't volunteered in my life, perhaps thinking about it now it would have been a good idea. Sometimes you feel lost in your life, and you don't know what you want to do. Spending some time volunteering may give you some ideas about a career you'd like to take. I always thought about giving my times for food donations but maybe next time. I wonder if my English is good. For example if tomorrow you ask me to write an essay for a test will I pass the exam?

In general it is important to tell the truth because that is morally right. But it is not always good to tell the truth. As I see it I am a really honest person, I hardly ever tell a lie. Sometimes the lie could make a person feel sad. So sometimes it is good to tell a little harmless lie. Of course it is not right to lie in some investigation or when you did something really wrong. That is because the first lie leads to other lies to cover the first one. And that is the real issue. On the other hand I believe that it is not bad to tell a little lie to make a person feel better. For instance if someone had dreadfully made haircut you would tell him a lie that the haircut does not look too bad. And that could make him feel better. Some lies also could encourage people to do something. For example if someone was scared of doing something that looks dangerous, you could tell him that it doesn't look too dangerous. This little lie could make him feel more confident. So as I see it is not always important to be honest. So in conclusion we should think about it before we tell a lie. But we should also think about the consequences of telling the truth. Because the truth can be something that you do not want to hear.

Some people from their childhood are considered to be extremely gifted due to their inborn ability to produce a beautiful sound while singing or they can learn how to play an instument in no time at all while others find it hard to play even the fluet while carrying out compuloryy tasks on music classes. Most people claim that music talent is innert and you can't do anything to change that if you didn't inharit that in a moment of your birth . It comes easily in some cases while there are also those for whom being familiar with notes means punishing training. But is it really true, that some of us are cut out to be musicians and others simply aren't and that there is nothing to do with that? Scientific evidence show that each of us is able to develop end shape perfect pitch to make some satisfactory progress in music. What is more the proof is that dealing with music have a good impact on cognitive abilities as well as contribute to maintain positive attitude to life and put musicians with right frame of mind. With reference to teenagers and children it contribute to better memory as well as higher marks and better performance in tests and exams. So if music proved to be so essential in youngsters' lives maybe we should give support students to get them involved in this kind of activity. The simplest way to engage them in music is by including the subject in schools' curricula. Even though they haven't felt fondnesss for music so far, lessons can change that.. Maybe it would be good to make it obligatory so that to force kids attend these classes to stimulate affection for instruments. '

For a lot of reasons, my most important holiday was the honeymoon. Prior to that I had already been in fascinating places, but the experience in Madagascar was absolutely the best I've ever had! We started from the capital, Antananarivo, and in sixteen days, with the help of a wonderful local guide with a car, we could see the most characteristics places in all the country, like forests, typical animals and trees, lifestyle of a normal person, and his very poor house. We were surprised by his genuine hospitality, without any impression to wish money or goods from us: our impression was he was happy even if he hadn't almost nothing. Within few days we changed a lot of landscapes, from mountain to the beach along the ocean, from city to the very rural farms: we came back with our minds lighter, and with our hearths full of love. Today, we can advise every tourist spending a holiday in this country without staying in a touristic village, but tasting this gorgeous life experience.

I think it is a great idea of the high schools. The children experience some real life experiences. Moreover, the can help in the community. You could for example volunteer in the home for the elderly and support the nursing stuff. Moreover you could talk with the old people. I am sure that they would be very happy, when they can talk to someone. Furthermore, I think you could volunteer in the environment. Maybe you can pick up some garbage, or you could plant some trees. I think the nearby cities have some things that also children/teens can do. You could also engage political. Maybe you have a youth advisory council or something like this. Then you could enforce your ideas for your city. So you have a say how your city should look. In conclusion, I think it is a great idea that students have to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate, because in order that students have a lot of free time, which they should use for a good cause.

Television is an amazing communication tool; it can entertain and also educate. Like any other tool, it all depends how it is used. One must be myopic to see only limited applications of television. Yes, it is the most common use by far and we can tell by the number and the quality of shows that are available for common individuals. There are many sport channels, competitions, and tv series. Every tired soul will find something to console itself and rest after a long day at work. However, if you are willing to educate yourself, you will find a program with meaningful discussions and content. There are specific channels dedicated to make its audience more knowledgable in the chosen topic. They usually do not display too many details but it is certainly enough to raise the interest in the particular discipline.

I believe that is really important to learn foreign languages. If you want to be connected with the world is necessary to speak foreign language. Nowadays we have online translators where you can find almost all languages in a bit. So it is not necessary to learn a foreign language when you can use the internet. In the past there were not any online translators. People had had to learn a language or look in a dictionary. The issue is that using dicionaries takes a really long time But if you want to travel a lot or to live in a different country you have to learn a foreign language. Currently many people or at least young generation is learning English. Almost every child has English lessons at school. But the problem is that if they do not use the language, the language will be forgotten. That is quite a big issue. Many people had learnt a foreign language and now they remember no word. In conclusion from my point of view it is important if you will use it. If not it is just a waste of time.

I think having new teachers each year is better than having the same teacher for several years since it is unhealthy for students' learning. It must be difficult to have the same teacher while upgrading the class. We have been learning new things in every new grade and if the same teacher is teaching for four years, he can be insuficient about new subjects. I can give a spesific reason if you want to hear it from me. I can say that our primary school teacher was the same person in first grade to fourth grade and my middle school teachers were different each year. I learned more and harder subjects than the primary school. In my opinion, teachers must also attend exams in order for them to be tested for the lessons that they are teaching. Besides this, I do not believe that students must always depend on teachers about everything. It is also the responsibility of students to do more practice themselves. Finally, I can say that, having new teachers each year is better than having the same teacher for several years.

In my opinion in these days learning to speak a foreign language is most important than it was in the past. In this age of a global world, people can move easily, without high costs, across the world, either for work either for leisure, so it is important lo learn another language beyond the native one. I firmly believe that learning another language is also a way to open mind understanding other culture. Nowadays in this world where borders are more and more wide people can take advantage of more opportunity. Secondly it is the age of computers, thanks to the Internet, every day people is connected to other people of all the countries. Not only other people, but everyone can access to information, thoughts, knowledge written in other languages. In this way a person could improve herself, his skills and also his way of living. To sum up learning to speak a foreign is more and more important, because in the modern world there are a lot of opportunity to meet foreign people, to know other cultures and even to live in other countries.

Dear council, are you sure your decision could be a good idea? I am writing to focus your attention on the central role that communication has in our life. You can be a mother, a manager, a doctor, and in each moment someone can call you for something of extremely urgent, and the same could be with a message: I agree that a bus full of passengers with their heads down on their smartphones can give a feeling of sadness, but I don't think a ban could be the best solution. Nobody prohibits speaking each other, so everyone is free to choose his behaviour, within the limits of the civil roles: about this, I could suggest a useful role about the use of mobile phone in public areas. Can you make a law that requires people to use headphones when talking on mobile phones in public spaces? I, and a lot of citizens like me, can't stand hearing the noises phone calls, sometime made with a loud volume: so, if it's your goal to put a role about using a mobile phone in public areas, please pay attention before banning a so important tool in our daily life, and consider the way to limit its use in a less noises way than now.

Nowadays, many young people have led a sedentary life style that means they rarely get involved in sports activities, and therefore it is suggested they should be required to do sports at least 3 times every week. I completely agree with this method. First and foremost, inactive life style has affected the physical health of young students. Without adequate physical exercise, they are more likely to suffer from some illnesses, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, which would do harm to their personal life and study in the long term. Thus, if they are able to participate in sports activities, these problems could be solved because their immune system and body circulation would be enhanced by doing sports. In addition, it is rather difficult for young students to form a healthy life habit without any instruction and help since most of them prefer to stay indoors rather than participating sports activities. Today, due to the increasing popularity of social network websites and the invention of smart phones, youngsters commonly utilize them to socialize with others and play online games in their leisure time which would lead to a sedentary life style and reduce the frequency of doing sports. Thus, if they could be forced to do sports after class, this situation can be reversed effectively. Admittedly, many opponents may disagree that young students should be forced to do sports for certain times as they ought to have rights to make plans for their leisure time. If they are persuaded to take part in those sports activities, they may hardly be interested in those sports and build a more negative attitude to physical exercise. However, one fact needs to be highlighted is that the physical problems caused by the lack of sports activities has been a growing concern around the world, which should be solved immediately. Besides, the addiction to computer games and social network websites have impeded the enthusiasm of doing sports for many young people, and therefore this methodology should reserve this situation effectively. In conclusion, from my own perspective, young students in universities as well as school children should be forced to do sports for 3 times a week.

Nowadays, medical doctor refer to work in cities because they find better oppoptunities to be successful than if they work in rural areas. However, this can be changed and improving the health care in remote zones. Firstly, the problems in health services need to be improved in both areas. The main problem in rural zones lies in the lack of growth opportunities, low salaries and the lack of necessary equipment. Due to these problems, medical doctor prefer to work in urban areas rather than rural ones. However, the solution could be implemented by the gobernment, offering better working conditions for medical personnel such as fair salaries and opportunities for growth. In connclusion, our health care services and medical staff need to be improved. People who lives in remote areas suffer the lack of these services more than people in the cities, I believe that this problem can be solved if the government to work towards improving working conditions for medical staff.

At first impact with the question, it's too easy to answer that the truth is always the only thing to say and to listen. Sure, this is a utopian reality, and a world without lies will not ever exist for the main reason that the human beings are imperfect. This obvious statement drives me along the line of thought that is a skill of some people telling lies that seem truth for a personal aim, and who doesn't have this skill is forced to have at least the ability to listen carefully the sound of the true statements. I don't think that one person can be able to tell always the truth, but there are very important differences about the way and the reasons why we tell a lie: sometimes we have to defend our bad behaviour, often it's necessary for a "politically correct" speech, in other cases it could be just to avoid that our listener could know our business or planes. But, such as I said firstly, this is a dangerous joke: if you aren't able to cover your lies, your risk is to damage your public opinion and to seem a liar, even if you tell the truth. However, the best way should be to choose the moments that need a sane lie, and all the others which it's better being sincere and truther.

The school of the future will differentiate in many ways from a standard educational model. The teachers will not occupy the center the of the class but will become a mere facilitators. However, the importance of their role will persevere. It is the profile of the job that will evolve. The teachers of the future will cherish the pupils and hold them in the center of their attention, the center that has been occupied by the teachers. All of the teachers will be emotionally trained to maintain a high level of communion with the students. They will have a positive attitude and dulcet voice so students can feel that they are welcomed at all times. Students will decide upon their schooling programme. They will need to know a little about all everything, and everything about one chosen discipline. There will be no grading system. The feedback will point out strengths upon which students can build their knowledge. However, the teachers will always be avaialble for students if they only wish to expand and amend some of their work.

The purpose of this report is to give all the general information about a site suggested us by our teacher to practise and improving our English. Never had suggested our teacher a site to improve our writing English skills, and honestly I thought my progresses would have been more quick and radical. However, there are some sides I really appreciate but others disappointed me. I do not like the fact that I have to subscribe a contract and I should pay a fee in order to practise with some tasks. This kind of resources should be free and all of us should be given the opportunity to practise them even if our English tuition is not so high. Only when you practise with it for several weeks, you can see some radical and persistent breakthroughes. What I really appreciate is the large number of tasks you can choose. What is more, they are classified in groups depending on your English level, it means you can adjust the tasks how you feel more comfortable. The percentage of new users is increasing, this is the reason why I think the site should be recommend.

As to "The school of the Future" in Japan, I think it will become more flexible. At present, basically we have to go to school physically and have to study in a class room by face to face. But after COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, Japanese government had to lock down the cities. And a lot of schools were closed for several months so that many children could not go to school. As the result of this, it was very hard for children and teachers to catch up the original school activities. Through this experience, Japanese government decided to change the way of education. The government gave PC tablets for all students each and started to use the tablets for the lessons. I think this is the first step for a school of the futre. In near future, we will be able to study on line, it will be not necessary to go to school physically. To be honest, I think there are many problems to solve to for realizing the school of the future. But it will be changed to go better way.

Every person has the right to equally benefit from the health sector, or that is what is written in the law because most people do not have access to doctors or medications. There are some countries that do not have hospitals, and even in the same country, some regions have large health institutions, while others lack doctors. These areas where there are no doctors are mostly rural areas because most doctors want to live in urban areas and earn a lot of money. We cannot say that they are wrong, it is not very moral, especially for a doctor, but earning money is essential for life. It is up to the government to solve this problem, as some governments have their own way of solving the doctor shortage. One of them is to distribute newly graduated doctors to the country by lot, so that enough doctors are appointed to each region. Of course, this method is a method applied for practitioners, it is not common for specialist physicians to go to rural areas. To solve this, governments can impose a salary increase on rural doctors or send them in a specific order. Of course, the doctors to be sent in a certain order should be carefully selected, because it would not be right to send doctors who have a child or a family member that they take care of.

Nowadays, almost all pf children spend their free time playing video games. This kind of entertainment may have positive and negative effects, but it depends on the enviropment in which the child develops. In my opinion, video games don't have a negative impact on children, in the market you're able to get any kind of video game such as didactic and battle. The positive and negative effects will depend on the atmosphere where children grow up, then a bad behaviour could be slightly affected by the games. In addition to this, there aren't research which shows that video games have negative effects (psychlogically speaking), however, there are research which shows positive effects on children and some video games have been created to develop their skills. To sum up, video games can be positive effects on children, but everything depends on the development atmosphere and how children are exposed to a certain kind of video game.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I disagree. First, I want to mention from books' advantages. Though technology improves steadily, books are still healthier. And although books can burn easily, digital books can vanish and crash easier. For instance, a recruit error can delete all the data. On the other hand, digital books can be stored easier and besides, don't require that much protection. Also, they can connect the big data. We don't have to wait for the latest version if books can receive momentaly updates. Thus, I claim we should maintain both kinds of books. Is there a fire in a library? No problem, we have all the same data in digital books anyways. Some books are deleted? Okay, we just have to scan the solid versions of those books. What do you think?

There are many things that affect our health. If we look from a narrow perspective, only exercise seems important. In addition to exercising, you should eat healthy foods and take care of yourself. In general, TV programs are destroying the facts about health and healthy foods. Therefore, people believe in some false ideas. If a person is overweight, he most probably has some health problems. In this case, he should go to a professional dietitian to ask for a diet program. Of course, you do not have to go to a dietitian, however, if dietitians are out of work, global warming can destroy the world. Dietitians cannot survive an hour without driving a Porsche, but you should give them 200 dollars and you do not need to look at YouTube videos. You do not need to pay that much money to live a healthy life, however, spending money for your eating and exercises more than consuming alcohol and smoking, will be better for you. Finally, I would like to mention that eating healthy foods and protecting yourself is very important.

However, there are many aspects to consider before releasing the zoo animals. Personally speaking, all animals deserve to live freely in their habitats. Wild animals should develop their nature away from human-controlled environments and we should learn to admire wildlife without hunting and destroying ecosystems. In other hand, it is known that many people fight to free animals of this kind of places, but there are some aspects to consider before doing it, for instance, the fact that possibly animals which has grown up in zoos wouldn't be able to sutvive by their own, because they're used to being to feed by humans.

I do not like to have futuristic talks, however, in my opinion, travelling will shift to the space. Inter-star journeys will be introduced by travel companies. In the future, communications between two planets will be among routine applicatons. If we talk about our planet and it means in 100-150 years (we have only 100 years left to live here), I think water vehicles cannot improve too much since there will be shortage of water in the future. Besides this, trains, autobuses, metros will have unusual designs and private vehicles and buildings will disappear. Now, high population is a very big problem. If pandemic disease does not continue, the streets will be overflown with people. This disease is a painful way to reduce population, however, if it did not occur, it would have brought the end of the world. As I said before, private objects will be vanishing and every vehicle will be having futuristic designs. We will also see dramatic changes in the designs of engines and roads. Finally, I can say that nothing will still be the same.

I believe that it is better for students to have new teachers each year. I have three reasons. First, if the teacher is bad for a student, the student needs to endure for several years. It is not good for an important period of the student growth. Second, if the teacher is only one person, it is difficult for the students to judge that the teacher is good or not because they don't have the person whom they can compare. As a result of that, if the teacher has an unfair thinking, students might be affected badly. Finally, one teacher's view and thinking is very limited. A teacher might notice a student' good point but the other teacher might notice the student's good point. I believe that each student has several different good points. If it was found out, the student can extend his/her specific talent. it is good for him/her.

Generally speaking, people who live in rural areas fewer than urban cities. Also, the financial basis in rural areas is lower than urban cities. As a result of those, doctors are not able to make a lot of money because of the shortage of patients and area's budget. However, the necessity of the doctor in rural areas is the same as urban cities. Thus, we need to find out any solutions to this problem. Regarding this problem, I would like to propose three solutions. First, to obtain support from national government. For example, it is to transfer the money from nation to rural areas as a medical budget. Second, to create a new law which every doctor need to go to a rural area for several years in their career as obligation. Finally, it is to change the government system. Political power and rights in rural areas are lower than national government. So it is better to change the social system and transfer the power from the national government to each rural areas.

Honest statements have not always been convenient for every person to tell. Correspondingly, they speak untruthfully instead. However, several critiques have been made towards the act of lie, although the lie is classified as white lie. Nevertheless, some people still think that white lie is appropriate to tell. Firstly, spreading a dishonest information has always been judged as a sin. This doctrin has been manifested in children's mindset since early age. The reason behind this cultivation is religious purpose, which correlated with the concept of karma. Secondly, a group of people is sceptical regarding the act of lie since it brings disadvantages for others. Every human being will certainly feel betrayed if someone tells them a lie, especially if it comes from a close-related acquaintances. In contrast, those reasons are broken by the advantages of white lie. Even though white lie has been denied by some communities, white lie has been acceptable for majority of people. White lie is believed to be beneficial instead of bringing disadvantages. Parents lying to their child for the purpose of eating vegetables by having slices of vegetables hidden underneath rice is a case in point. In conclusion, informing an untruth information is often unacceptable since it brings harm to other people. Based on aforementioned information, white lie brings benefit instead of drawbacks, making it tolerable for majority of people.

In my opinion, we are already experiencing the school type of the future. Since we are passing through this pandemic period, all of our lessons are held online and through computers. Similarly, school ceremonies are moving to online platforms. In the future, everyone will have more online meetings and learning sessions than they were having in the past. I think that the school of the future will still be the same. The learning techniques and the school buildings did not change much from how they were hundreds of years ago. Holograms and other cool things are the first ideas that come to most people's minds when they think of schools of the future. However, they have probably watched StarWars too much. If Stanley Kubrick did not start the futuristic/fantastic fashion, no one would have tried to develop them. In addition, most people think that school will not exist some time in the future. Therefore, I think that all of these are unrealistic ideas. Lastly, I can say that the school of the future will still be the same with the pandemic time that we are living.

BIGBANG is my idol, I am a big fan for 10 years and I always try my best to go to concerts one time of my life. And in the end, I can do it. Do you know BIGBANG?

In my opinion, if producers create healthier ideas, television programmes can be helpful in the education of people. Television channels have competition programmes on science and technology. However, most of these programmes are not good enough except a few of them. Television is not only an entertainment tool but also they make documentaries. Television channels are trying to make their bests. Most people say that the Turkish television is not able to reach global standards, only trying to meet public's demands. I agree that "Turkish series are not good" since the scriptwriters are not thinking carefully when they write the texts. Our directors are also applying what they learned from the art school. Art and cinema schools create artists like a factory. They are all the same and they are using the same formulas. They do not have any creative ideas about their professions. If it will still work like this and televisions will use the same shows on all countries, we will watch only the same factory's products with different languages. Lastly, I can say that TV creators must be able to upgrade their shows.

Write about television is a good challenge because there are so many ways to talk about this topic but I will talk about how television improve the form of people receive the information about the world. First I think the idea of television in the beginning was just entertains people and pass the time. But actually the idea of television is so much compreheisive because there are many TV shows that teaches us something important and are things that we probably don't go see on the school. Therefore most TV shows there are in the television is just for entertains us and pass the time with bullshit things. I think the way that we use the television is the principle discustion here because there are many people that put and bad channels that don't go add nothing in our life. So if you are one of these people I think the problem is you to use the television the wrong way

Some people might believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. However, I also believe that zoos are not good for animals. I would like to consider that I replace animals to human based on some examples. First, animals in zoos are separated from their parents and children. I do not put up with that. It is very cruel. Second, animals in zoos end their lives in a cage or very limited field. Same as the first example, it is very cruel too. Third, animals in zoos are seen from a lot of people. It is not relaxing in the surroundings. Fourth, there are no options to everything. For example, they are not able to eat their favorite foods. They are not able to get married whom they love. The situation is not fun for me. I believe that no one has rights to control anyone's lives including any animals. So it is difficult for me to accept the zoos.

Employees in some offices are working in enclosed workstations or cubicles. However, I do not like that way. Moreover, I believe that it might be more efficient not to separate employees each other by walls. If there are walls, it is not easy to talk with anyone. If there no wall and all space are free, employees are able to sit down where they like every day. Because of the spread of COVID-19, a lot of employees have been working from home remotely. As a result, many employees don't often get to use their desk in their office. Then individual desks were no longer needed compared to before. So we do not have the needs to make walls to separate each employees. I understand that the situation and efficiency depends on the industry. However, if the company is able to have options, I recommend not to set walls in workplaces.

Nowadays, education institutions include in their curriculum extra activities to their pupils such as music and arts. On the other hand, some schools do not offer music in their syllabus. In my concept, the arts are crucial in all education systems, and consequently, they should be thought to everybody. Learning music is one of the activities which help to develop mental skills, especially when teaching starts from early childhood. There is a great deal of social research that has proved the positive connection between brain development in children and the ability to play a musical instrument. Some schools, for instance, have introduced music classes in their schedule, however, and unfortunately, only private education institutions can provide these classes because of the high cost of musical instruments that parents might not be able to afford. Another point to take into account is for being considered as a music expert, a person needs many hours of full time and dedicate study, and obviously, this is something than public schools are no able to provide, and probably students either. I consider that teaching music at school should be compulsory. Our society must find ways to engage our children with the arts because they are part of our history, culture and spirituality.

Play is a natural way to interact and practice different skills. Video games, in my opinion, have a similar role on young people, therefore, I have positive felling about children using video games. I am going to explain it now. There are many researchers about the beneficial effects of gaming to children. One of those have found that boys and girls develop and improve important social skills as such team-working, fast strategy decisions, which are highly valorated by multinational companies. Another very important ability to be developed during games is the understanding and the practice of the English lenguage as reading, listening and speaking mostly. The last paper I read was focused in the improvement that younger people have in their performance solving problems too. Parent negative thinking about video game came from their ignorance and bad relationship with their children. Basically, many of them grew up without experienced video games and they are scared of them. If parents put in balance the permission to play games and socialize in real life to their children, it could be beneficial. It is only needed to take care on the type of games and the amount of time they allow their children to play.

Some people might argue that it is necessary for children to study music in schools. I understand where they are coming from. However, I don't agree with them. I think that music makes us happy and it is good for us to study music. However, there are a lot of options other than music. For example, it might be a painting. It might be a video game. Music is just an option. So it is not necessary to study in schlools. People should study music as an option if they like it. It might be painful for people who don't like music to study music in schools. It is not good to let people do what they dislike. Moreover, music class needs a lot of money. Schools need a special room and musical instruments. They are not reasonable. Thus I think that all students do not need to take a music class.

Nowadays, thanks to technological advances, people have an easy access to a lot of kinds of shows. The television offers wide variety of shows, but people should be aware that not all programmes show good information for us. Firstly, with the invention of TV, people were able to have access to another kind of entertainment and cable TV has increased the range of shows that we can watch. There are shows of different topics for all ages, some of these shows can be used to learn any kind of subjects such as history, science and atronomy. However, there are shows that were not created for educational purposes, performances that show violence and inappropriate language. That is why people should learn how to choose appropriate shows for children, even for ourselves. To sum up, we have access to a long range of shows which can be good or bad. Currently, we are capable of obtaining information about shows we are interested to, so it depeds on ourselves if we see an educational show or not.

I think that to learn a foreign language is as important these days. I think that it is necessary for us to learn a foreign language as a part of liberal arts. I also think that through learning a foreign language we can find the difference between a foreign language and a mother language. Furthermore, we can find the importance of leaning a mother language. So I think that to learn a foreign language is as important even these days. Some might point out that along with the improvement of transrating technology it is not necessary to learn a foreign language. But I think this is not right. Even if the transrating technology has improved and we can use the automation transration machine, I think it is not enough to communicate with foreign people. I think that it is also important to understand a foreign culture when we communicate with foreign people. To understand a foreign culture, I think to learn a foreign language is one of the best way.

Some people might argue that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle. I understand where they are coming from. However I don't agree with the argument. First, does an inactive lifestyle definitely have a negative impact on their health ? Do people die early if they don't do sports? I don't have related data on my hand. Also I often see people who don't do sports live a long life. So I don't know the positive correlation between health and sports. Second, even though there is an obvious data which indicates the positive correlation, it is not good to make people do sports as obligation. I understand that it is important to put people's health first. However, we should respect people's right. People have rights to do something they like. For example, some people might feel happiness when they are in their house all the time. They might understand that it is better to do sports for them. However, they want to put their happiness first. Still, should we force them to do sports ? Third, some university students and children have already been doing some sports spontaneously. In that case, if schools and universities forced them to do sports more, they are tired. I don't know the percentage of them. There is no date. However, it is definitely not zero. Fourth, favorite sports are different from each children and university students. It might not be pleasant to do sports they don't like. It is not good for their mental health. Thus I don't agree with the argument.

I think that it is impossible for computers and tablets to replace books completely in schools and universities. With the improvement of technologies, I also think that computers and tablets can repleace books to some extent in schools and universities. To replace completely, I think two problems should solve. I think the first problem is how to digitize histrical documents. A lot of historical documents are not digitized so that you have to go to libraries to read them if you need. I think it is difficult to digitize such histrical documents and it will take so much time to do. I think the second problem is how to keep the security of the IT network system. If the IT network is down because of some trouble, it is impossible to use computers and tablets. Recently it is often happened to shut down the IT network in the world because of the computer virus. So I think it will take for a long time for computers and tablets to replace books completely.

Someone might prefer a shorter life but much more intense. I understand where they are coming from. However I would like to live a long, calm life. There are three reasons. First, I would like to use a lot of new technologies. As you know, technologies have been developing and innovated every day. I am not able to imagine new technologies in the further. So I am looking forward to using new technologies and living in new lifestyle. I might live in the moon. Second, if my life is long, I am able to experience a lot of kinds of things. There are a lot of things which I want to do. If my life is short, I am able to choose just a few things. However, if my life is long, I don't take care of anything. I am able to go where I want to go. I am able to eat whatever I want. I am able to read a lot of books which I want. Third, because I am always happy when I am calm. I like drinking a cup of black tea outside with my wife on nice day. I like to lie down on grass in a park. I like to chat with my lovers and friends calmly. Anyway, I have naturally lived like that already. I will live more than 100.

Given a choice between a long, calm life and an accelerated lifestyle, I would opt for slowing down the pace of life for these following reasons. For one thing, there are potential drawbacks of leading a fast-paced lifestyle. Due to being pressed for time it is highly likely that people would rush things, and inevitably make mistakes. Also, people would avoid reflecting on experiences, therefore no lessons is learned and no adjustment is made for the better. Even though people might feel better about their use of time compared with those with a leisurely pace of life, faster lifestyle could lead to stress and its consequent effects. For another, adopting the lifestyle which is calm and tender could be beneficial. Firstly, people would have moments to reflect on their experiences, hence improving the future outcome when the same scenario happens. Secondly, this pace of living would allow people to avoid the probability of being stressed as well as the better chance to relax and recharge their energy. That is the reason why every year thousands of people would flee the big cities in search of the rural idyll. Finally, some people are not driven by a determination to stridently blaze a trail through life due to their deep appreciation of the present. It may also be a smarter and more strategic approach to life's unpredictable turns. In conclusion, though living intensely with a timetable full of activities sounds exciting, I think people should get out of the fast lane and introduce some slowness to their lives.

IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN ENGLISH Have you ever given a thought to the matter concerning how your life would change if you spoke perfect English? Let me tell you my experience with regard to this issue because it definitely changed my whole life. Incredible though it may seem, I have learnt English on my own, although it is fair to draw attention to the fact that I learnt some of it at school, along with high school. But most of my current English is the result of years and years of hard work with that language. The primary purpose for me was no other than understanding the lyrics of my favourite songs as I am a music lover, without a doubt whatsoever. That is why my curiosity for learning English started. What I had never imagined was the fact that I would become an English teacher. What is more, had it not been for my passion for that language, it would be quite hard to find a suitable job for me nowadays in which I could manage to develop my job and my role as a mother at the same time. So, next time you stop and wonder if you are capable of learning English, whether you are old or not, you should take into account the fact that, as I said before, it is never too late to do it. Besides, you will not regret doing so.

I believe that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. There are three reasons for that. First, because I believe that happiness comes from one's health. If I want to eat what I want, good health is required. If I want to travel where I want to go, good health is required too. Second, there is the possible to make money if I am healthy. On the other hand, the way which I use money is restricted, if I am not healthy. Third, if I am not healthy, I need to put up with pains. It is not comfortable.

Nowadays, learning several languages is more paramount that it was in the past. To begin with, all states in the world are connected to each other. Because of globalization, countries exchange information, goods and people. Indeed, many jobs are expecting that their employees speak different languages.

That's why, speaking a language is a way to be embedded in a country with a different culture as ours. To put in a nutshell, not only is it crucial to speak a foreign language for work but it is also a way to get by and to be embedded in another country.

I do not have strong opinion about zoos and I think that I can understand both sides. With my limited knowledge I would describe myself as a zoo suporter. I can't help it but I like zoos. I am not so much keen to animals but I think that the reason is that visit of a zoo used to be special day on elementary school and I can remember the feeling. The other thing is simply that animals are not humans. It would be cruel to keep innocent people against their will in a cage but I think that animals can appreciate such conditions. They are not driven by fulfilment. They don't need high stimuls to work properly. However I understand that it is too much for some people. If you believed that animals are like humans you can't like places like zoos. So I just don't think about the animals and I agree that it is ignorant but you know what? I care a lot about so many things that I can't care about everything.

In my opinion one of the most important characteristics of honest and loyal people is to tell the truth and let me say that it not only defines a person as a good human being, but also as a reliable professional. We know that the modern world are full of liers and as all we know one of the places of the world where we can find a large group of dishonest people is the dirty place of the policy. Despite what I said we have to notice that it wasn't ever in that way, because some years ago it is used to see politicians that tell the people the truth and most important of all some of them didn't have problems to warn the population about the problems, the mistakes and other things related to them that of course today they don't have the capacity to say. That is the best example that I can give you in order to explain my opinion about the theme that I was asked to talk. Speaking about the specific point of the answer: of course it is not acceptable to tell any lie. Even if we have negative points or mistakes made in the recent past we can't tell lies to other people. Lies can destroy both great relationships and friendships and make the world an unpleasant place to live and in order to finish: we know that today's world is a very toxic place. So it is our responsibility to make it a better place to our sons.

I agree with the fact that we need to do some exercise to have good health, but the other question that refers to there more important things to do I disagree completely because one day has twenty-four hours, we sleep around eight or nine, if we go to work or school, then we spend another eight hours, so we have at least eight more to complement our activities, for example, doing homework, housework and leisure activities. Therefore, I think that is difficult not to have time to do some exercise, I mean, a lot of people may say that they don't have enough time, but I think that they merely don't have is the desire to do some good for their body. On the other hand, we have people that really want to do some exercise, but they can't find time due to work or school, so they need to organize their time in the same way as they do at work or school. We need to recognise that we need to do some workout regularly to be healthier, and giving up those thoughts about exercise is something that only people with a lot of free time can do.

Dear Council members I am reporting to you because I have an opinion regarding the new use rule of mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants. I don't think that the new rule is not a good idea. There are three reasons. First, I have no idea the necessity of the rule. Why is it bad for people to use mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants ? Is it bad manners ? Is it noisy ? If so, why are you just going to ban mobile phones ? There are a lot of kinds of bad manners other than using it. There are a lot of kinds of noisy matters other than using it too. Nevertheless, why are only mobile phones banned ? It is not reasonable. Second, the reason why is that I often search for information by using mobile phones. I would like to use it during chatting with people on transportation and in shops and restaurants. Third, the reason why is that there is no effectiveness. How do you check if people do not use it or not ? We need much money if you assign a person who is in charge of monitoring. I would really appreciate it if you could reconsider on the rule. Yours sincerely, John Smith.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that playing video games is the most common current teenagers fondness, moreover it has given many employment. However, this activity is equally undervalue by adults, since the game is a great distraction source. Firstly, most video games shows players different useful skills, such as creativity, following instructions against the clock and coordination. Furthermore, there are some available games in foreign language, therefore you might be forced to understand the words and, consequently, your brain will think more.

An advantage of this activity against bits world is natural light radiation, moreover muscles movements. Finally, getting a job on video games industry is actually quite easy. By our days, young people can have a degree of Graphic Design and create their own computer games, and even a Translation graduate could write the script of a Nintendo videogame. As a conclusion, I argue that video games are really important in our contemporary lives, since they have made a huge impact on our society. So, dear parents, you should not try to hide this art to your children.

Even though lack of exercise brings negative effects to our bodies, it is not appropriate to force students to play sports. Indeed, there are several reports and research about the negative effect caused by the lack of exercise. Therefore, many articles advocate the advantages of frequent exercises and sports in magazines, newspapers, and the Internet. However, it is another story when it comes to forcing students to do exercises and play sports. The following includes other feasible way to prevent students' health from getting worse, better way to encourage student to exercise more, and the reason for my disagreement. First, playing sports is not the only way to maintain our health in a fair condition. In other words, having well-organized eating habits can also have an impressive effect on keeping good health. For example, calculating the number of calories in your meals, ensuring the nutrition you taking in meets the daily requirements, avoiding having meals in midnight, and not touching fried meals. Second, Instead of setting rules about how much they need to exercise in a week, it is more rewarding for them if there are related events, contests, or even championships. By holding a variety of sport events, the students will be interested in sport rather than being forced. Last but not least, it is possible for them that some certain way of playing sport does not make them exercise enough. For instance, picking defensive positions in basketballs and baseballs. Not to mention those who got no interest in these sports try to find a cozy spot for themselves and watch the whole game without moving much. In conclusion, I do agree that people refusing to have a proper exercising habit will eventually lead themselves to have a body with deteriorating health. But it is also necessary to find a flexible way for students to enjoy sports, instead of forcing them to do so for their own good.

My favourite season of the year. I would say I love all the seasons, but asking me for a favourite season, I would prefer Autumn. Autumn is a season of colour. Its colours changes its outlooks. Especially the red eyebrows and the yellow beard, the exquisive purple eye and a pink smile. Actually, these are not the perfect reason that I love Autumn. There is a story behind it. I still remember that year in late Spring, when I was only 6, my parents took me to my grandparents farm in the countryside. It was very boring those days, because there are no Wifi and internet. I have nothing to do for days. One day, when I was playing in the barn with some nuts, something in the corner caught my eye. It was a squirrel. It was watching me. I looked at it, it looked at my nuts in my hands. I threw one him. He caught it and ran away fast. About 2 minutes later, I saw him arrived again, this time, with 2 more squirrels! I started to have fun with them. What brings me together with Autumn is animals. I love animals, they are adorable, too.

For long time, in almost all schools the students are required to do a volunteer work. This kind of works allow students to obtain some experience, but there are not many places which want to give opportunities to young people or do not offer a healthy atmosphere for them. Firstly, the voluntary work has always been a required to graduate from any high school or University. As a estudent this kind of works allow students to get experience, tenangeers are able to apply knowledge that they have obtained from the school and they have a better idea about how working life is. However, for students select a volunteer work is not always easy. The range of options for this kind of jobs is sometimes limited, the timetables are not comfortable, as a volunteer the student do not receive a salary and some companies exploit the students. To sum up, voluntary works will always be an excellent option for students to get experience, but as something necessary to be able to graduate, the Schools should research for good options of volunteer jobs to offer to their students.

Following the recent and dramatic development of the Internet, schools have to update their way of teaching. The question at hand is: should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities ? On the one hand, substitute books in tablets could be very useful for students. As a matter of fact, books are generally numerous and heavy. It is consequentially harmful for students' back. Moreover, tablets could make the learning more entertaining: there are usually many animation, it is quite fun for the students to discover them. On the other hand, tablets are not flawless. Indeed, they present a major impact of the student's vision. It is not healthy to stay behind a screen all day long. Another point to consider is whether the tablets are really reliable. Sometimes, the tablets may cut out, Internet could stop working. Besides, using tablets significantly increase the risks of cyber-bullying. Of course, a contrary opinion might be that students are grown up enough to behave like adults. To put in a nutshell, even though tablets are handy, they can be hazardous if they are used on a daily basis.

Many new electronic products are invented these days. It is not special to see people even children using computers at home and tablets in public places anymore. Since these electronic devices are commonly used, and network technology is quite steady, schools start thinking let students use computers and tablets for learning instead of papers and textbooks. In my opinion, e-learning should be totally adopted in school campus. First of all, replace books by tablets is environmentally friendly. Books are made from paper and some contain plastic, and people have to cut off trees to make papers. Then there is less fresh air produced, the soil would also loosen without consolidation of tree roots. Abandon books that contain plastic will pollute the environment as it is not easy to be digested in nature. Compared to paper which affect the environment, electric device cause less damage to the nature as we would't throw device away frequently. One must not forget that tablets and computer is easier and effective to learn than books. Tablets and computer can store documents as many as you need to study. All we need to do is find the location of the document and open it. We can also use them to watch educational videos for having fun while learning. If paper is used, it is difficult for us to find a worksheet in a pile of notes. Add on it, there is no video in textbooks, only print out pictures for us to take a look. It is less interesting and effective than using electric device. In conclusion, I think that schools should take advange of modern technology in to education. it is a fantastic tool to learn and acquire knowledge as they can broadcase video and have huge storage. It also save the planet at the same time by reducing deforestation and air pollution. Therefore I agree that computers and tablets should completely replace books in school and university.

INTRODUCTION The aim of this report is to explain what I want to achieve in this new school year and to sort out what I will do to accomplish my goals in the future. AREAS OF MY LEARNING THAT I AM PLEASED Firstly I want to stand out areas that I am glad with, such as literature, music and history as while I am studying it I find it too rewarding. In spite of saying that art is an outstanding area as I totally fall in love with it when I am in class and also seeing that when I go to the museum I can understand perfectly well pictures. AREAS OF MY LEARNING THAT I WANT TO IMPROVE Nevertheless, it is absolutely important to say areas that I want to improve seeing that not all the things are flawless. For example areas such as maths, physics and chemistry seeing that they are too complex for me as I don't understand anything and I feel too frustrated when I study it. However, I want to improve them as I totally believe that I could understand them. THINGS THAT I WILL DO FOR ACHIEVING MY GOALS In the long run it would be too profitable for me to see tutorials as I might understand maths and physics better than now. Besides that I will work too hard for accomplishing it.

My favourite season of the year is summer because I like when it's warm outside. It's the time when everybody are going to holidays. I can visit my parents, my friends and fly somewhere abroad. It's my sream to fly to exotic island, somewhere where is nice, just sea and blue sky. Last summer I was sick and it was a first year of pandemic so I didn't have real holidays, spend only couple days with my boyfriend not far from home. This year I'm not sure I can afford any trip, maybe into the mountains. I love climbing in summer, autumn is good too, in spring is too cold for this kind of activity. I'd like to change my job, so I probably won't be able to go somewhere for a long time. I remember the time we were visiting Greg in Barcelona.

Hi Robert, I would like to mention in this e-mail that my favorite activity that I do in my free time is watching movies. My favorite film is "A Clockwork Orange" which is directed by Stanley Kubrick. Most of the book readers do not like this movie since the film and the book are not exactly the same. However, I can say that the film is actually excellent for me. There are many small details and cool things that nobody can easily notice. Besides these, the film music is composed meticulously. Also, the camera angles are adjusted in a very professional way. Therefore, if you did not watch it yet, I would strongly suggest you to not miss it. Sincerely, Kıray

Actually, it's over two years since the tumor was cut out of my brain, and I'm still not in shape I used to be. When I was visiting my doctor, he said that I still have something in my head. Something else. It turned out, that I needed another surgery. This time it was malicious tumor, a glioma.

Music is an important part of ours life. For sure, everyone has contact with music everyday - on TV, on the radio, in the Internet, on our phones. Even if we learn about music in every school level from kindergarten to high school. However, in some school learning music isn't required. For me, it's good, because not everybody has to learn music. At the beginning I want to say that not everyone has a talent to music - to play on instrument or sing. Obviously, it's normal. We all are different, we know and do things otherwise so not all has to know music well. What's more, lots of people are shy. In that case, they may have problems with learning music because they are ashemed that they have to play or sing publicly. To be honest, I am an excellent example for that. I learnt music at primary school and it was really challenging for me. I was incredibly shy - I sang very quiet and I was nervous when I had to play something. Because of that I was scared before every music classes. And that's not a point! Music classes should be calm and stressed-free. So you see, not everybody has to learn music at school. I truly believed that even if we don't learn it, all of us has enormous contact with music. And I'm sure it teach us more than normal classes at schools.

Someone might argue that exercise is important for our health. I hear what they are saying. However, I believe that there are more important things. I have three things. First, it is important to sleep enough. Based on some research, if there is not enough sleep, the positive effect for health decrease. That is because the growth hormone is generated a lot from a deep sleep. Second, it is important to take good ingredients too. After exercising, muscles need to recover. Then it is necessary to take the good ingredients. For example, protein, vitamins, minerals. Moreover, we need to take good ingredients for my good health and mind. Third, it is important to be relaxed. I believe that it is most important compared to the other things above. It might be good for health to get a little stress. However, generally speaking, stress is bad for our health. And the relaxation is good for getting rid of stress. So it is better to make a good situation which we are able to be relaxed. To summarize, it is important for our health to exercise. In addition, it is important to sleep enough, take good ingredients, be relaxed too.

Computers and tablets should take over the role of books in academic institutes. Electronic devices provide much greater use than printed materials. For instance, they update information faster, store greater quantities of data and permit access to the Internet for further research which are the essential limitations of traditional means of storing information. It is also observable that for such convenience, in modern times, books no longer retain their appeal to readers as they used to, which is witnessed by the drastic decrease in book sales. Therefore, computers and tablets are bound to replace the hard copies of words in schools and universities. Replacing manual with high-tech devices in education facilities is a risky choice for the fact that it requires exhaustive financial resources to purchase these appliances. In Vietnam, a similar proposition was introduced to the National Congress but was denied for costing half of the national development budget to initiate such transformation without any definite guarantee for its results. In conclusion, modern technological devices such as tablets and computers should not be encouraged to be present as the main storage of information in schools and universities.

For years, schools have designed different methods of study, many of them have included extra classes such as singing and music. Research shows that such classes are beneficial for students, but not all schools have these classes for their school population. The advantages of learning music have been shown by research.

Television entertains, but can it also educate? Many people love to watch TV, so do I. Sometimes people watch TV for 2 reasons. The first is to entertain, second is to know. We entertain when we are tired, stressed, or bored. We open up a show and enjoy it. We also study with it. Many people think that reading everything in books is boring and prefer to watch some TV about studying. Both are acceptable. But which is which? It depends. It depends on shows and people. Entertainment shows will only entertain, but some educational shows will indeed be a great help. Shows like BBC Animals and Scientific shows are all useful. It also depends on the people who are watching them. If a person that likes to think watches an entertainment movie, he will also think about the movement and the actions in the shows. But if a person likes not to think and just watch whatever is on the show, give him to watch an outer space discovery, he will know nothing after that.

According to me, computers and tablets should not replace books in school and at university. First able, books are a beautiful invention. They have been written by great autors, and they are a real stuff, that you could hold in your hand, not like e-books that are just on your screen. Second able, I think that you could not have the same concentration, with a tablet or with books. I think that working with a screen, could really disturb someone who tries to study. For example, in this pandemic period, I am working all the day on my computer. And that make me realized, that I'm much more concentrated in class than for my screen. Third able, I think that replace books for technology, is really sad. Books are such a beautiful invention, where you could find stories or whatever you're searching for. It is one of the last thing, that is not yet created by technology. I think that it could be really disappointed to replace such beautiful things for electronic things. In conclusion, I would not replace books for computers.

Let's get straight to the point, buddy: I have a lot of movie recommendations of many kinds, I think I like them and I can brutally criticize them, so I don't have a top, but I'm going to present to you a masterpiece from the '90s, more precisely a movie for teenagers. " 10 things I hate about you" is a classic, everyone should watch it, especially because it is well written, the actors did an amazing job and capture teenage moments full of love, drama and innocence. Maybe it's a story, with a happy ending, that some of us secretly expect and want to happen to us. It would add a little spice, you'll see! This film is one of my favorites, because its story is immaculate, it is easy to understand, the characters evolve upwards and the plot has points when the drama moments intervene perfectly.

People prefer to play video games more than physical actions. Some people think that it is a bad situation for our children. On the other hand, most children are defending the idea that there are some positive effects on us. In my opinion, if you are not playing that much, it can be enjoyable and okay. There are many tasks to do other than playing video games. Therefore, I can say that playing video games are acceptable when you are not playing one full day. I can also say that there are not negative or positive effects on our daily life. Children are saying that their perception skills improve dramatically when they are playing video games. However, if you are not playing a real coordination game, you cannot evolve that much with shooting games. Finally, most video games are not like those "Blue Whale" or anything about suicide. I know that there are too many killing games, however, I can also say that they are not harmful. To sum up, video games are only for having fun, you do not have to be afraid of that.

I think is better to have a balance between the years that the teacher had to educate the students, where neither isn't ideal to have many years with students and have a single year with them. I believe that the teacher needs to have time necessary for building a firm relationship with students. This relationship with students helps teachers understand the behavior and profile of students, for the teachers could develop a program of education that can improve the understanding and absorption of content passed on to students. On the other hand, it's important for students to have the diversification of teachers teaching over the years. It's necessary because the students end up get accommodated with the teacher that they were already accustomed and this can disturb their learning. Therefore, to identify a happy medium for this situation is the way to improve the learning of students and their relationship with the teachers.

The answer is shouldn't. We mustn't replace books with new technologies. Here's why: Books are knowledge gathered by our ancestors, and they are much more valuable than gold. Nothing can replace it. Here are some points that is why books are treasures that human beings cannot erase. Let's talk about the benefits of reading a book. First, it let you think about the scenery or the scene that the author is writing. It is way more helpful than reading something with pictures and tell you about the settings straight away on a digital device. Secondly, it benefits your body. We all know that books out of wood or stone. Digital devices are not the same. They will harm your eyes and brain, making you somehow unable to think probably. It's fun watching a show on the TV, but it's difficult reading on a screen. It will somehow distract your concentration. It will also be tedious as your eyes will get tired and bored. However, books are not the same. Whenever you read a book, even if it is the same book, you will still find happiness and something new that you haven't noticed before.

Someone might argue that it is better for university students to live own while they are attending school. I agree with a part of their air gunner. That is because they are able to build their independent and make free time. However, I think that it is better for university students to live with their parents while they are attending the university on the other views. Firstly, finance. Generally speaking, university students don't make a lot of money by themselves. That's why they need to depend on their parents in many cases. So, if they live own, their parents need to bear the burden more in addition to the tuition. It is not reasonable for their parents. Secondly, time. If they live on their own, they need to housekeep by themselves. They need to study a lot as university students. However, they who lives own have to spend their time a lot for the other things like the housekeeping. It is not reasonable. In conclusion, I believe that it is better for university students to live with their parents.

If I have to make a choice between a long, calm life until 100 years old and a shorter life but much more interesting, I will certainly choose to live a shorter but much more intense life. First of all, I think the point of life is to dicover, explore and experience. It is always of great fun to meet with new things and chat with different people while travelling. I have held this faith since I was a child that life shouldn't be completed without knowing other parts of the world except your hometown. By living an intense life, we may meet more difficulites than living a calm life. But we will have more knowledge about the world after that. Difficulties and happiness are both parts of a real life. Secondly, I think living a calm life is boring. With all the things you are familiar with across your whole life, life can sometimes be less attractive than being accompanied by different people . Sometimes We focous on the length of life too much and ignore the beauty of differences. I am more like a free person than a flexible one. Therefore I enjoy spending time on travelling and exploring. I think an intense life allows me to be able to be who I am and do whatever I am pleased with. In the end I would like to say that I actually want a life that is both long and exciting because you never know what is waiting for you.

Visiting a zoo is one of the easiest ways to learn about animals, although some people believe that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. In the beginning, I would like to mention that zoos do not keep dying out animals. In general, it is difficult to see animal species that are dying out in the world. Secondly, zoos are really helpful to increase our children's level of knowledge. I think that you all know what a lemur is, however, most villagers do not know those kinds of animals. The reason for this is that there are no zoos at most of the villages. On the other hand, some people are completely against putting animals in a zoo environment. They think that animals must be living in their own habitat. If they are to be kept in a zoo, the living environment must be designed perfectly as if they live in their own special and suitable natural habitat. Lastly, I would like to say that I agree with the second approach.

In some schools, music is a required subject and all the students have to study it. However, some schools permit scholars to study or not study it. I think that music should be studied by all the students. In my opinion, music should be examined in all the schools and by all the students because it is a beautiful subject which has a lot of benefits for us. Indeed for some people, music is a way to relax and release the stress that is accumulated during the day. It is a fantastic activity that you can do in your free time, especially when you are bored. In other words, learning an instrument is a great activity to do as it has good efforts on us. Study music is also a good method and opportunity to establish new friendships as it allows you to know more people. For instance, if you want to know more people or you are searching for friends, you can join a band or orchestra, and this can be helpful even to improve your musical skills. Music can become also a passion for you. Indeed you can develop an interest in the instrument that you are learning and it can help you to try something new and find something enjoyable. To summarise music is a subject that should be studied all the schools because it has a great number of good efforts on our minds.

Generally speaking, spring is during March to May, summer is during June to August, autumn is September to November, winter is December to February in Japan. I think that each season has each good points. It is cold in winter and sometimes it snows in Tokyo. Compared to the northern area in Japan such as Hokkaido, it is much better in Tokyo but I do not want to go out in winter because it is cold. As it is getting warm and warm in March, I am looking forward to seeing the cherry blossom.

Nowadays, learning a foreign language is not only a professional requirement but also it represents a competitive advantage in the inteconnected world where we live. Furthermore, is it is well-known that English is the most useful and recognized language around the world, bearing this in mind many people are looking for methods and tools which help them to learn English quickly and efficiently. Speaking personally, one of the best and useful tools for learners of English is Write and Improve a free application developed by Cambridge in which every learner can practise her or his writing in order to improve her grammar and fluency. Moreover, this application gives a topic and some questions or poits to develop in the text, after that one can write the text according to a certain number of words required. Then there's a check button which automatically gives an evaluation and feedback of the writing, which comes up with some symbols so as to correct some mistakes or to improve some parts. Additionally, this platform is mainly about writing essays, emails, letters and proposals, as well as writing in formal and informal ways. Apart from that, this marvelous tool has different difficulty levels such as beginner, intermediate, advanced and business level which are custimizable, thus one can choose its own level according to the English level of each person, so as to start with an appropriate level and go up the level of complexity until becoming the CEO of English. In addition to that, the main features of this platform is the huge variety which is a boon for every learner so to prepare for any English Test, other feature is that at it gives you all the necessary feedback and an approximate level in which you probably are, this latter could be B1 or C1 or C2. However, what I most like about this app, is the amiable design to use, the guides to write and the variety of topics after all these characteristics are essential for a learner who wants to boost her writing skills. Despite all its benefits there are some difficulties at the beginning, such as one can struggling to find ways to being a C1 or C2 it means that once one get a higher level the most difficult is to get higher, another instance could be that one learner can stressed out herself when she's run out of ideas to develop within the text; but nobody says it was easy to learn and get better in a target language. So, it would appear this platform have its benefits and some challenges, nonetheless I highly recommend this platform for all learners who are seeking a tool to write faster and better

My favorite season of the year is autumn. I have four reasons to support the idea. First of all, we can obtain good foods in the season. we can get a lot of crops like rice, fruits, fish, and vegetables. These ingredients can be used to make delicious dishes. These dishes will keep us in better physical condition. Secondly, the climate is conducive to exercise. Fall is not too hot or too cold to move our bodies. If you play some sports, autumn is more suitable than any other season. I also like to play tennis, and I can play well in the season. The probability of getting injured is the lowest in a year. Thirdly, we can study very well in the fall. The climate also gives us the best condition to read books or learn something. It is easy for us to make concentrate to get to start learning. The quality and efficiency of learning might be improved in the season. The final point is that I have a birthday in November, so I used to get birthday presents from my parents. This season of autumn has some touching memories. I was given board games as birthday presents, and my parents and I played the game together. We enjoyed the game and it allowed us to maintain good communication and valuable relationships. In conclusion, I think autumn is the best season to start a new challenge in terms of climate.

I think that we have the same problem in Japan. Most medical doctors want to work in cities for earning more money. As the result of this trend, there are not enough doctores in many rural areas. I think that there are some reasons for this problem. One is that there is a regulation that doctors are not be allowed to see a patient by internets in Japan. In Japan, we have to see a doctor by face to face, doctors can't see a patient by internets by the regulation. If the regulation will be changed, doctors can see a patient by internets, I think the problem will be solved to some extent. Whereever we live, we can choose a doctor and see the doctor by internets as a first step. If the regulation will be changed, it will be eased for doctors to live in cities. Second is that it costs very expensive to be a doctor in Japan. In Japan, if you want to be a doctor, you have to study in a medical university for 6 years and have to be qualified for the medical license by the government. Except public medical university, private medical university's cost is expensive, I think that it is necessary to pay about 5 to 10 thoudsands dollers per year. I think it is difficult for ordinary people to pay such high costs. So I think that if there are more scholarship fund enough to increase the number of new doctors, the problem will be solved to some extent.

Do you believe that school is dull and should be reformed ? Well, education has long been a bone of contention. That's why, I would like to present you several aspects of school that in my opinion will evolve in the future. Let's travel one century forward ! First and foremost, the first point I would like to raise is that schools will adapt the courses for each student. As a matter of fact, it is nowadays challenging to know exactly at high school which occupation we want to do. That's why, students will have the opportunity to follow multidisciplinary lessons, which include sciences, arts, music, technology, languages and literature. Afterwards, in year 12 they will have to choose several subjects they would like to refine in order to prepare their studies in college. Another thing to consider is whether the students keep being evaluated with marks. Actually, it is universally acknowledged that is stressful to receive marks for a worksheet. Consequently, a lot of teachers have been thinking for another type of evaluation, with colors. Red if the skill is not mastered, orange if the skill is currently learning and green if the student has perfectly understood the expectations. One cannot disregard that marks are not always representative of the student's level. The main goal of those reforms is that students arrive at school in high spirits willing to learn. To put in a nutshell, not only will school adapt its courses but it will also support better the students in their career. What about you ? Tell us about your vision of schools in the years to come.

High School requirements are strict in many aspects. One of them is the volunteer programme, this kind of requirement could be a remarkable opportunity to learn and gain experience from a different kind of work. Nevertheless, this activity can be tedious to students because they have to deal with school stuff and the responsibility to do this volunteer programme, sometimes they do not have enough time to develop their activities properly because they have extra-scholar activities such as sports clubs or any other type of activity. Anyhow, I think a volunteer programme is necessary for students to have the experience to work in the community. They have the opportunity to know different environments, to know different life-situation in life. Students can also discover what they want to do in their life and what they want to study at university. For those reasons, I think volunteer work to graduate is a tedious but necessary thing to do to graduate because there are many benefits from it.

My reasons for learning English We live in a globalized world, where all the things and people are connected to each other. Communication can be hard if you know only your mother tongue. So, know a global language such as English is extremely important to be heard and to be understood. Because of that I decided to learn a new language and I chose English. All people that are playing a role in a global scale use English to communicate to each other. When I noticed it, immediately I started to study English and it become a daily challenge. Studying and learning English is important to me because I want to live overseas one day. I am aware if I don't master English, I will habe problems when faced any situation in which that language is necessary. So, in short, people in the globalized world need English and, whether I know it or not, global positions will still exist. So, I chose to learn.

I think that the video games are positive for children. Playing video games improves logical reasoning of children and further develops creativity and imagination of children. Logically, the children must be the monitoring of parents about the time that they spend playing video games. When the children spend a lot of time playing video games, what is positive and take advantage end up turned negative, because the children will have difficulty on school and in the social life. For example, my parents always delimited some rules that I needed follow, as just playing video games if I had finished my homework. This is working and I got good grades in school and yet I had time for playing video games. Another observation that the parents need to have is to observe the games that their children are playing. Must have to avoid that children playing violent and sexual games. With the follow-up of parents, children can develop, through video games, many positive atributes over their growth.

The recent technological changes in society have brought up an interesting discussion regarding the complete disregard of books in schools. In my opinion, we should get rid of all the books in schools and universities with regard to learning and I will explain why. Books contain pure magic. They tell stories and enable us to practise empathy. However, the main goal of books in education is not the magic but the knowledge they contain. On top of that, there are some incredible benefits to using technology in schools. The digital learning aids are able to correct the student's work, saving the teachers a lot of time. Some technologies are even able to send students to an exercise that best fit their current level of learning, enabling personalized learning. I therefore believe that books should always be in schools but not as a means of learning.

I think that it is effective for me to work in the offices which there are no walls separating employees from other colleagues. In Japan, most Japanese companies have this kind of offices, which there are no walls separating emplyees from other colleagues. For me, I already got used to work in no separating offices. Because I have to cooperate with our colleagues to do business, it is convenient for me to work in no separating offices. I think that one of the merits for no separating offices is to be able to communicate with each other whenever you want. On the other hand, if a person who work by oneself, I think it is effective to work in enclosed workstations. I think that a person who basically work by oneself, such as researcher, investment analyst, consultant, they get used to work oneself. If they work in offices where there are no walls separating from each other, I think it is not effective for them because they can't concentrate on their work.

Recently I've discovered a very useful tool for those who are keen to improve their writing English. This tool is called Write and improve. It allows you to write about hundreds of topics, which you can choose freely. Everyone will find something for them! As I said by using this tool you are able to improve your English skills. You just simply write about a certain topic and when you feel you have finished, you send the answer. After some time you get your feedback from Cambridge! Then you can either make some changes to improve your work or move on to another topic. For sure the best part about this tool is that you can get some feedback and continue to improve.

It doesn't matter, if you are currently travelling by train or bus. The Write and Improve allows you to write from every device that you own (it has to be connacted to the internet)! When it comes to downsides, it may take a long time before your work gets some feedback. Another problem is that it also has limited amount of topics on which you can write.

At least after finishing all of the works I believe you will be able to express your opinion about any topic easily.

In general, people think that it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. There is a classical example about the importance of taking care of your health "noone can buy a healthy body with their money." Firstly, I can say that your health is more important than being rich. Therefore, we should be aware how critical our health is. If you have a healthy body, you can live without any pain in your daily life. Besides these, to be healthy is also important for a longer life. In addition to this, being healthy is not free and this can be very expensive sometimes. Therefore, sometimes we need to pay a lot of money for our health and being rich is important in that part. If you are rich, you can live an easy life, however, you cannot choose your diseases and your pain levels of your health problems. Finally, I can say that being healthy is the important thing in our life since we are living in our bodies and we should be careful about them.

Studying in another country takes many advantages for students. The students can learn things that are a trend in the world. For example, if a Brazilian student to go to the United States, this student will learn many things that have not yet been commented in your country. Furthermore, to study in another country have the advantage of learning another language, this being very valuable for the professional career of the student. Another advantage is the opportunity of the student to increase his networking due to the fact that this student can meet with people from different countries and professions. However, to studying in another country has disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is the fact that the student needs to leave your family, a fact that can destabilize the student emotionally. Another disadvantage is the money necessary to travel and live in another country. Live in another country is dispensing, even if the school or university offers a scholarship for students. In general, the opportunity of study in another country is unique and must be taken by the student.

I think that it is important opportunity for students to do volunteer work. I think that students can have a very valuable experiences through volunteer work. In general, I think that one of the meanings of volunteer work is to be able to contribute to a society which you belongs. For example, a volunteer work such as a clean up activity in a town, if I participate in this volunteer work, I can contribute to keep a town clean to some extent. I think that one of the meanings of volunteer work is to be able to help others. For example, a volunteer work such as a supporting to handicapped people, if I participate in this volunteer work, I can help handicapped people's activity. I think that through this kind of volunteer work, I can find various things which I did not find ever. And I think this kind of experiences are valuable for students for their life after gratuation. I also think that it is difficult for students to do volunteer work by themselves. So I think a condition which a volunteer work is necessary to graduate is reasonable for me. By volunteer works, people can obtain a valuable experience which make people grow as a member of a society.

Nowadays, most of medical doctors want to work in cities, which is of course not a perfect scenario for rural areas. Let's have a quick look why it is happening and how can it be solved. The most crucial reason for this is very simple. In cities, especially big ones they are able to earn more money. Everyone wants to be paid good. Another very key thing is that it can be tricky to get a house in rural area. It's a lot easier to rent an apartment or a house in a city, as well as, often less expensive. Also they don't have to spend a lot of time to get to work, and as we all know time is very important. Who would want to spend 2 hours of their day just to get to work? There are few things which can be done to solve or minimze this important problem. Firstly, we need to reduce the time which is required to get to a doctor. We can achieve it by upgrading our roads and making more roads for bicycles. This solution will help reduce the time spent at the doctor, as well as ,it will increase the number of patients, which will boost their earnings. It also should create new opportunities for investors, which will build new housing for doctors and other people. Secondly, we need to show people that they don't have to wait few weeks just to get to a doctor. By choosing a medician from a rural area they can reduce the waiting time. It's good for both patients and doctors. Everyone benefits from it. I think that my solutions are not enough to fix the problem mentioned above, but they should easily reduce it.

some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion is helpful even to students as the same as to society, we live in times where people need support, and help in any possible way, our students will graduate and be the future professionals and by realizing volunteer work they may become better people, and our society needs professionals who besides his knowledge has love for humanity, in my personal experience I did a lot of volunteer work when I was studing, I went to a Africa and see the peoples needs and in my simple way but with all my good feelings I worked there. we really need to create a better world, and starting for students doing volunteer work may be only the beginning of something bigger, maybe our society can improve and a hope that my genaration can be part of it.

Education is fundamental for humanity, and so are schools which have a significantly presence in our lives in a professional way and they have huge influence in our personal growth, as a result as we move forward, the schools need to change and improve in order to proportionate much more benefits to the students and the society. Apart from that, it is mainly known this pandemic caused by Coronavirus has brought many changes in many aspects and areas from our lives, one of them is the education specifically in the schools. Back in the old day, students used to learn in physical classrooms and interact with their teachers and classmates, however because of the coronavirus nowadays students must take class virtually through platforms such as teams or zoom, hence students learn through the computers and they don't interact with others which according some studies this can limit them to practise what they learn, after all they barely see their faces or participate, in fact they only turn our cameras on when they have to make presentations of final projects. Given this mentioned, the situation represents a challenge and at the same time an opportunity for schools to be prepared to help in the development of the students. Despite, some changes are necessary and it stands to reason that we have to adapt to the circumstances is not so easy. Currently schools have many challenges to face in order to not only maintain their tuition but also to keep their levels of educations so as to prepare the students in better ways. Additionally, it is important schools bear in mind the research about the academic performance of the students during the quarantine, which has been made by professionals from some of the most prestigious universities, this research show up some important issues such as students don't learn in the same way because they are sited down in the same place for a long time they can either they get distracted or they get frustrated; which implies they do poorly at virtual school. There are also some social and mental consequence, owing to the lack of social interaction students are liable to feel isolation and they can often have negative feelings and thoughts. Not to mention, the increased in academic load represents a hindrance to the education which not only affects students but also teachers. By virtue of this latter, schools will be different in the future, in order to guarantee the students safety while they are learning, they will have larger classrooms with appropriate ventilation, they will reduce the capacity in each classroom, they will install disinfection points with antibacterial gel and they will also develop protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. Moreover, schools in the future will have to install cameras which will facilitate the students to take lessons from wherever they are, they will use more platforms to explain some topics and to reduce the workload to the teachers; besides schools will have to train their teachers so as give and teach better in this virtual modality. On the other hand, school might be still be the same in some aspects as for example their open spaces, their scholarships, their bathrooms, their requirement to enrollment among others. Definitely, schools will recreate their facilities and the way they teach, taking into account many strike features although the main purpose is to assure the students they will get the best preparation for their futures.

Hi Robert, I went to a concert last week with my old friends and I can say that it was really wonderful. We saw a concert banner while we were walking down the side street of the school and the banner said that there is a Will Wood concert on the circus campground. Besides these, tickets were also affordable. Furthermore, there were my other friends from school, however, they only came there to see how the concert area looked like. In addition to this, an acrobat has fallen down the roof when she zipped on the ceiling. We immediately helped her to stand up to continue her performance again. It was an unfortunate accident full of excitement. I hope you can join us in the next concert and we can enjoy the event all together. See you soon, Uğur

I think there is not hierarchy of things related to health about what is more important for our health. That said, there is a balance between the things that are important for our health, where those things are interrelated with each other. Besides exercise, there is mental health. Mental health is essential for our diary performance and, above all, for our social relationships. Without solid mental health, people are prone to anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, and poor performance at work. Furthermore, people with poor mental health have a negative perspective about their future. People succumb to the lack of planning and they don't can be successful in their lives. To improve their health, people need to meet the equilibrium between mental health and physical health. For this, people can do exercise before or after work to improve the physical health, and people can meditate early in the morning, practise a hobby on the weekend, or they can spend a day with their family to recharge the energies and to improve your mental health.

I think that it is better for university students to move away and live on their own. I think that it is necessary for university students to be independence. Different from high school students, university students have to choose what they study in a university, so they should do everything independently. If you live on their own, you have to do by yourself whatever you live every day, such as making own bed, making meals, cleaning up own room, purchasing goods which you need. I think that your family have supported you to live except studying when you live with your family by high school student. But I think that university students are already a part of social members so that they have to be responsible for their own activities inculding everyday life. I think studying is only a part of everyday life. To live on their own is a good opportunity for university students to be responsibility on their own life. But I also understand that it is impossible to live on their own because of some economic reasons. By living on their own, it will cost more expensive compared to live with their own family. From my personal experience, I lived on my own when I was a university student in Tokyo. Before that, I live with my family so that expect studying everything was done by my family. But after live on my own, I had to cook by myself, clean up my room by myself, wash clothes by myself, get up by mayself. Until getting used to do, it was very tough for me. But I think that this experience was very importnat for me to be independence. So I recommend university students live on their own as much as possible.

Dear Sir or Madam of the town council as of recent the town council has been taking a bill into consideration which would ban the use of mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. I believe this not to be a wise decision seeing as this may have unforeseen consequentses if it would come to pass. because of this I have decided to outline a number of them so as that the council may make an informed decision. first of all the banning of mobile phones in public transport will not stop the use of mobile phones unless it becomes the responsibillity of the drivers to enforce this regulation. second of all the restaurants will be put in a difficult situation. either they lose most if not all their business customers or they turn a blind eye to the use of mobile phones. moreover even if resaurants would want to enforce the ban who would tell the customer? certainly not the waiters and waitresses who depend on the customers good will to survive. a similar situation is to be expected in shops. Third of all this will drive any visitors to the town away in mere minutes. as seen above all the ishues stemm from how to implement the ban not from how the people will react to it. if the question of implementation is not addressed adequatley then the ban may as well not exist seeing as no one would enforce it then. I cencerly hope you take my points into consideration when felling your decision.

Speaking personally this new year means a new beginning for me so as to set new goals and shoot for the stars in different aspects of life among those there's the school; hence I come up to think and reflect about my performance at school therefore I have determined that I want to work on different areas in order to be an exemplary student andlearn even more. First of all, I have identified areas of my learning that I'm pleased with such as chemistry, maths and science, I regard myself really good at them. Moreover, I enjoy learning about maths and science, as a result I'll keep my habits of study in those areas in order to get better and to be part of the honor roll, which has been a personal goal since a long time, so those habits are the following: solve extra math problems every time that I have problems to learn a new methodology, enroll myself to science workshop which is given every semester by the best teachers at school, and not only I will procure to go to the library to do my homework but also to study with friends to receive feedback and learn other ways to do the things. On the other hand, I have to admit I want to improve in some areas of my learning, as English and German in which I've been struggling since the last semester, to tell the truth I think languages are incredible and can open doors to awesome opportunities in life, bearing this latter in mind I want to improve and make languages a boon in professional career. So this brings up to prepare and plan some actions to do in short and middle term so that I will be able to achieve my goals in this new year. For me the gist of the matter is that I have to practise my speaking and listening, as the saying goes practise makes perfect then I will listen to every day a podcast and a lecture in English and a lesson from German. Furthermore, other actions that I must do is to have virtual calls with some friends who know how to speak German and English, it is highly probable that they have a higher level than me, although the higher the better owing to this I will feel the pressure to try harder but at the same time I will feel more inspired to learn more and to not give up. Apart from that, I will program some test every two weeks in order to evaluate my progress and to be able to evaluate my action plan, I mean if I have to modify something or implement more activities. Finally, this is just an overview of my plans to develop in this year, I have tried to describe a brief about the areas of my learning that I'm pleased with and others I want to improve and make them public to others, in that way I will get the best of the school and surely I can shoot for the stars, because according to some research you are liable do be more persevering to achieve your goals once that you have done the public commitment to meet your goals.

Although video games is not one of my favourite pastime, I know they are very popular with all-aged children. It seems that children from the richest countries have a stronger interest in them, and the bulk of their time is spent with them. This is an attitude that makes people worried and comprensively angry. What parents are afroid of is their sons incapacity to socialise with others; this means that children will run the risk being isolated adults and what is more threatened is the inability to find a good job. I consider it a serious problem that involves not only children but the entire society. I disagree with those who think that video games could have some beneficial effects, unless we refer to some mental diseases where video games are suggested as a teraphy. In general they are a useless pastime, in spite of children feel video games make themselves at home. As I see it, there some side effects as the risk to suffer from a long isolation that in the most serious cases could turn into a mental diseases like depression. Unfortunately, there is an always increasing number of people that need a psychologist to recover from their bed mental state. Another delicate issue that should not forget to treat is the large amount of violence that children experience through video games. The point that all scientists agree is the children's difficulties to make a difference between reality and playing, and they think life can be a window-shopping like a video games. To the best of my knowledge, video games have never made people more clever and the efforts of the society should be addressed to prevent childred to overuse them.

Nowadays zoos are the place where families pass the bulk of their time, because they are under the misimpression that their sons can learn about nature and animals. This is a false impression because when you want to learn about animals you have to aee them in their natural environment. What I mean is that animals living in a zoo are denaturalised, and you cannot learn nothing interesting. To the best of my knowledge. when a family gots a trip around the real animal's environment, they learn much more than they do in a zoo. In a zoo there are only few animals and you cannot see how they behaviour for example when they stay in a herd. Seeing three or four animals is just a drop in the ocean; you will see how more exciting is to study animals in their natural environments. For example a herd of tigers are hunting zebras and smaller animals in a huge ground; this is something impossible to see in a zoo. Another remarkable point stressed by environmentalists is that animals are not well treated in a zoo and they soffer living in small rages. In other words animals need beneficials of a wildelife. In spite of some proposals to enlarge the rages and the zoo area, this optimism-based statements do not persuade those who want to see animals flee in a forest.

Nowadays, every company have an office. In some offices, employees work in open workstations. Other offices have an enclosed design - they are usually older ones. In my opinion, the very first way, which is also newer, is a better choice for a modern office. Just think about it. Everyone wants to work in a place where there are no walls separating employees from their co-workers, no matter of the position in which they are - everybody can be accessed easily. Another very important thing is that it allows them to people feel like they are in their own houses. Because of that, they are simply more cozy. Further going, due to reduced stress, people are more efficient and they are more likely to do their tasks correctly. It is a perfect example of a win-win situation. Employers are happy because, workers are doing their work right and employees are happy, because they are not stressed at all. Unfortunately, this type of design has some downsides too. There are jobs in which you have to be precise. In those scenarios, people have to be focused, so it might not be optimal to have an open designed office. It's for sure easier to achieve when you are in an enclosed, quiet workstation.

In some offices, employees work in enclosed worksations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design, in which there are no walls separating the employees from their co-workers. Both settings have advantages and disadvantages, so in this essay, I would argue that enclosed worksatations are better, because it gives more space and privacy that employees need in order to function more efficiently. In addition, offices with enclosed arrangement can allow workers to work in a more organised way, and it can also prevent workers to talk to each other during work time; and that will improve work outcomes. However, offices with no walls separating employees can promote instant interactions between employees, at the same time, it could be distracting for emplyees; which may result in reduced efficiency and productivity in work. Finally, offices with enclosed workstations are much more convenient than those with open design, because it promotes organisation, discipline and efficiency in the workplace. Unlike open settings in which workers may get distracted by each other; which may result in decreased productivity in work.

Music is plays a vital role in our wellbeing. In some schools it is compulsory for students to learn and play a musical instrument, while in other schools, there may be no music at all. In this essay, I will argue that music is important for students but it shouldn't be a compulsory. I believe music must be taught in schools, because it is a common communication language between communities around the world, and it is also known for its psychological effects such as reliefing stress, anxiety and fears. It is scientifically proven that music can be used as supporting treatment for some neurological disorders (e. g. Parkinson disease). Furthermore, music plays a vital role in almost everyone's life. Some people listen to music for reliefing stress or remebering good moments in the past; such as times spent with friends and family members. Music itself can be a gift for humanity, and we should appreciate it by teaching students how to play musical instruments; because that promote their self-confidence and allow them to express themselves through music. I highly recommend music should be taught for school students in their early years, because it will promote their self-confidence and help build their personalities.

Some university students live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family. I think living on your own as university student is much better than living with your family while you are studying. I think so, because students at university level should learn to be independent in their life matters, because as we get older we sometimes tend to be far away from our families; so we need to learn how to deal with that without them. Life is so hard sometimes, so we need to learn how to handle the problems that we face along the course of life. As university is the final stage of Education, and it is said to be transformational stage in which studnets' mentality will grow up to become more independent. So, in this important stage of life, students tend to expose themselves to different environments and form new relationships with others and interact as adults. While living on your own as university student has many advantages, living with your family during university can also be a good alternative specifically for young or minor students under the age of 19 years old whose life experience isn't enough to deal with life struggles alone. In conclusion, I would say it is better for university students to live on their own for some time away from family to learn how to deal with life problems , but for young or minor students it is safer for them to live with family members while they are studying.

According to a study by the Oxford University, every third child world wide between six and twenty is overweight. Caused by the inactive lifestyle many young people have today, this shocking number is the indicator for the plan to force university students and school children to do a sporting activity at least 3 times per week. As the options for children and teenager to do recreational activities without having to move are innumerous, the motivation to be active is accordingly low. Therefore it is necessary to take action, by enforcing physical activity into the weekly schedule of students. Firstly, it is important to argue, that this plan is preventing our modern society from a dangerous and unhealthy development, since the obesity of young children can have grave effects on their health. To only mention a few, diabetes, cardio vascular problems and cancer, are illnesses caused by the consequences of overweight. But this does not only take a toll on the person concerned, but also on the health system. Having to increasingly pay for the medical aid of children and teenagers, the health system is not equipped to endure any more stress. The only way to help, is therefore to force children to do sports. Equally important is the following argument, concernig the impact sport has on the mental health of students, since sporting activities not only, allow children and teenagers to move, which releases the hormon dopamin, but also enables them to spend time with their peers. Research shows that activities in groups can aditionally have positive effects on the students grades and helps them learn important social skills, such as team work and fair play. As a result the children and teenagers, become happier and better members of society. In conclusion, it is important to enforce sports into the students weekly schedule, as it not only improves their mental and physical health, but also because it has a great impact on the functionality of society.

A lot of high schools nowadays, requires from students to complete some volunteer activities. They are necessary in order to graduate. As everything, this practice is not perfect. In my honest opinion this practice is not a good solution, so I think it shouldn't be practiced. It's just not good for students. There are few reasons why I think this way. First of all, everyone is different. Not everybody enjoys having a conversation with strangers. So, some tasks may be stressful for them. I'm the kind of the person too. It's terrible to force someone to do something that they don't want to and doesn't feel well about doing it. Just imagine a situation that you are forced to clean toilets after other people which you don't even know. I'm pretty sure that, no one would enjoy and like it. It's that simple. There are more reasons why I think this practice is not optimal. People which are forced to do something may not do it correctly. If they do something wrong, they can cause some hard problems. In exmaple, this situation may happen when someone is helping an older person and they give them too many pills. It's probably lethal for this person. Not only they will be dead, but more importantly it will probably cause some serious mental illnesses for the volunteer, because they were forced to do something that they didn't want to.

It is very interesting topic. I studied the basic school twenty years ago. We had only paper books and it was enough for us. Today is other world. New technologies are the most grow up all around the world. Children can study with more opportunities than we could before. I had only a paper, a pencil and a pen.

HI-TECH SCHOOL I am highly secure that in the future school would have developed awesome robots who substitute teacher thus classes will be more enjoyable and amused. Also, scientists will be setting up stunning automatic doors and windows. As well as that pupils won't have to knock on the door so many times or open windows all the time. Furthermore, school won't have books for learning as they will offer wonderous tablets for students. As a result of that they could carry the material easily without weigth trouble. Therefore, the schoolchild will have at his disposal a lot of delight electronic lockers which has an outstanding security system for backing up students material.

Currently, in majority of schools students have to study music. They sometimes even have to learn how to play a musical instrument. In my honest opinion this type of requirement is not good for students. Let's have a close look why! First of all, everyone is different. Not everybody is interested in playing music, they simply might be keen on other things. It might be stressful, if they are forced to study music and/or learn to play a musical instrument even, if they don't want too. I was in similar situation back in the primary school. I had music lessons, which I didn't enjoy and I had to learn how to play on an instrument, which I also didn't enjoy. More interesting is that, at the time I was keen on playing on other instrument which is guitar. I was really satisfying for me. Another reason why not to force everyone to attend these lessons is that some people might be harmed due to high volumed music and high stress. It can hardly affect their mental and physical health. It might be the reason why they might want to commit sucide. At the end I think that forcing someone to do things which they don't want to is bad and might be harmful for them.

Hey Chris, What going on? How are you? I am already seeing forward to see you next Saturday, when we will go to the local museum! For now, I just want to tell you the basic facts about how we are going to travel to the museum, what we can see there and what you need to bring with you. We are going to take the bus, so we can come to the museum in a proper time. You will need a bus ticket, but you can also buy it directly in the bus by spending about five Euro. Please also take some food and drinks with you. The drinks, as well as the food, are really costly there. You should also remember to take your camera with you. Maybe you want to take some photos? The museum, we are going to go into, exhibits colossal skeletons of ancient dinosaurs. They are also going to exhibit fossils and stuffed animals. It seems to me as it is a very interesting exhibition. I am seeing forward to see you next Saturday! With friendly greetings, your friend Dieter.

Dear Mr Michael I am writing in reference to your plan about banning the use of mobile phones in some places. As a resident in this area, I have talked with other local residents about their opinions and we would like that you will know our points of view. We live in a tourist city which means that our economy depends mostly on foreign people. Tourist people want always to be able to have access to the social media, they want to show where they are, what they are doing, what they eat and how they feel in specifics places; that is way currently restaurants, shops, hotels, parks and public transport offer free access to the internet. This service has allowed that some places have been recognised worldwide; in consecuense, if you decided to implement this law, a lot of establishments will be affected seriously. I am the owner of a restaurant and we have made a research about how we would be impacted by the new law, if this law is applicated our affluence of customers will be reduced approximately 40% of the total and probably we must dismiss some employees. We hope you reconsider not to implement this law, this in order to protect the economy of our community. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you. Best regards.

The school of the future will provide more technology resources and virtual freedom to the students in the classroom. This school will be different from the present schools in aspects as more classes in distance learning, where it will decrease the barriers between geographical distances, making possible the students of other cities, states or even countries studying in the schools that they dream so much. Certainly, the school of the future will have a virtual class, where the students will take lessons without the necessity of being present in the school. Another thing that will be present in the future is the massive use of tools that currently are avoided in the classroom like Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and others. Of course, some things that are present currently in the schools will remain in the school of the future. The contact face to face with the teacher will continue existing and the physical presence of the students in the school will keep being an important factor to learning and relationship between students, teachers, and schools.

Have you ever imaged your life on future? What kind of the life would you like? A calm and longer life or a shorter but intense one? Someone would choose an intense and various life instead of a calm and satble one; on the other hand, some may prefer a steady life.

A shorter life but much more intense which means I would not have enough time to accompany with them to create more pressure memory, although I would have an exciting or a proud of experiment in my life. In addition, I am a greedy man whom really desire to live longer to deeply explore this world.

Every student must make a decision to either move away and live on their own or live at home with their family while they are studying. I think that moving away from your parents is a better choice. Let's have a quick look why I think like this! First of all, by moving away from your parents you will have to do more things than just cleaning dishes. Those things are for sure important activities which will help you in your adult life. You will also have to set your budget. Not sticking with it will be problematic and you will probably have to rent some money. So, managing your money wisely is a very important thing in an adult life. Further going, you will also have to do all the paperwork by yourself. There may not be any person to help you out with it. Additinaly, paying taxes is another activity which you will be supposed to do in the future. It sometimes might be tricky, but it's for sure really important and by doing so you will learn a lot. Also, you will have to find a house or an apartment on your own. All of things and activities which I mentioned above will help you get more mature and more prepared for you future life. Remember, that in the future no one will help out you with those thigns.

People always have debated the importance of telling the truth. It is a subject which generates opinions crash, but we could tell that there are situations where you are forced to tell lies. Persoally speaking, along our lives we deal a lot of situations which forces us to tell lies; some people think that telling untruths is a characteristic of a bad education, but no one is exempted to invent histories. For instance, children told lies to their parents or teachers to avoid getting into troible and this kind of behaviour allows parents to teach the importance and the benefit of telling the truth, as an adolecent sometimes we lied to protect our privacity or to feel free and independent. People use lies as a weapon of defence, sometimes when we cannot deal with problems on our own, and these lies can be interpreted as call of help. In other hand, during our development we learned the consequences of telling lies, we are aware that tell lies could get us into more serious trouble, even though, we still lie because, no mathher if we are child or adults, we are afraid of what might happen, of not controlling the situations or of being harmed by certain piece of information. In conclusion, as a humans telling lies is part of our nature, during our development we learn that telling lies could give us bad consequences, however, sometimes we are forced to invent something to avoid problems, to protect someone or to protect ourselves.

Nowadays, most of doctors are willing to work in the cities where they will be able to earn a lot of money. And this in spite of the crucial need for doctors in many rural areas. There is obviously an issue: why are the doctors leaving the areas where they are most needed for cities and big town, which are already full of skillful doctors ? First and foremost, doctors leave rural areas because of the conditions of work, as they feel for most of them underpaid and are willing to make money. Therefore, those doctors will move out to town, in a view to increase their income by having a wider amount of patients - a clientele that will undoubtdely outnumber the one you could ever have in a small countryside's village. Moreover, they may feel as if they were stuck in tiny villages lost in the middle of nowhere, and try to get closer to the big cities One of the solution that could be set up to solve this problem, other than the traditional proposal of rising the incomes, would be to sensibilize the doctors to the desperate needs of a medical presence in rural areas. By and large, very few physicians are aware of this need, let alone of the appalling situation in which some of those areas are in. We could therefore act in this way, through medias or lectures in medicine schools for instance.

Dear sir or madam, even though I appreciate new and innovative ideas for policies in our town, I would like to raise some concerns regarding the new proposal to ban mobile phones on public transport, in shops and restaurants. On the one hand I think most citizens can agree that it is untactful to have loud phone calls in the before mentioned spaces, but on the other hand it is not advisable to ban something just because it is rude. It is not a crime to take up place for two on a bus with your legs spread wide, and neither should it be a crime to loudly argue on your phone there. If the culprit is a significant nuisance the bus driver could tell them to get off the bus even with the policies that are in place right now. ' For shops and restaurants such a proposition is ridiculous. These places are privately owned and thus the owners and staff should decide on their own what is allowed there and what isn't. I think anyone would be hard pressed to find any good reason why a reglementation of mobile phone usage would be required here. Lastly I have to mention that this proposal is defined so vaguely that even using one's phone quietly, for example listening to music with earbuds or checking one's e-mails would qualify as an offence. I do not think the public would be in favour of this. I very much hope you take these points into consideration. Yours faithfully, Herbert Herbertson

In most schools, studying music is optionnal or there may be no music classes at all. Nevertheless, maybe the students should, in regard to all the benefits they might withdraw from it, have to study music. I think music is to be widely popularized in schools. By and large, people consider music as a pleasant hobby or as a nice concert to attend. At no time will most of them truly realise all the benefits they may get from music learning, mostly because nobody actually told them. Music can be seen as another way to communicate or express a wide pannel of feelings, generally on a softer way than we usually do, especially when it is about strong feelings and emotions such as pain, anger or passion. For instance, if you are taking issues with someone and that it makes you angry, then music may help you. Rather than having a falling out with this someone, you could play music - and throughout it express all the emotions you are holding. Furthermore, learning an instrument, although it may be long and hard enables people to improve the learning and pursuance skills of the future musician, with a view to reuse them later. Learning violin, an instrument on which playing isn't that easy, can be a real challenge but first and foremost a real opportunity to reach out perfection. Moreover, music can be really helpful for introvert person who find difficult to interact with others, who prefer to stay back and may feel frustrated by it . It can concern antisocial, shy or less talkative people but also extrovert and expansive people who might find it difficult to keep their cool and remain calm despite sudden and strong feelings. To sum up, music is really to be popularized.

Television can educate at the same time that it entertains. Currently, television is facing a disruptive transformation in the way that people watch television programs. Television is further becoming an environment with more political and social influence on people. It's common in the grid of television, programs talking about events that impact the mode how society behaves currently. Due to changes in people's perceptions, television needs to approach delicate matters, such as environmental damage, homophobia, racism, violence against women, child prostitution, and other critical matters. To educate the public about these topics, television needs to be unbiased, principally about political issues. Television opinions have a profound impact on how people think about certain issues, so television needs to be unbiased so that it doesn't align people's thoughts. Therefore, television remains an important way of communication ideas, news and opinions. If television wishes to remain as the main way of communication, it needs to change the way that acts.

Dear Sir and Madam I am Fred Yamada, live in the town for many years. I heard that the town council is studying bannning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. So I would like to let you know my opinion. I have objections to the banning. Firstly, please let me know the reason why you want to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think there are no reasonable reasons for banning the use of moble phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I think that it is reasonable to ban the use of mobile phones in the concert halls. Secondly, please let us know the reason why you want to ban the use of the mobile phone in shops and restaurants. I think that in shops and restanrants are not public space, but private areas. Is it possible to restrict the use of mobile phone in private areas by law? If owners want to ban the use moble phones in their shops and restaurants, it may be possible for them to ask customers not to use mobile phones. Thirdly, if you implement banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, in emergency how to contact with the people who are on public transport and in shops and restaurants? Nowadays, we feel that mobile phones make our life more convenient. So it is difficult to restrict the use of mobile phones by law. I sincerely ask you consider the restriction. Best regards,

I think that to always tell the truth is not so important, sometimes it is necessary to tell a lie. I think basically to tell the truth is very important. I think that the one of the most important things on business is the trust. To grow up the trust with stakeholdres including customers, I think it is very important to tell the truth. For example, if a vehicle manufacturer have some business trouble such as recall of their vehicles, in general, such company should apologize to the customers and send a recall notice for all customers who take the vehicles. Such company will tell the truth of the reason for the recall. The reason why such company take above actions is to keep the trust with stakeholders. So I think that it is important to tell the truth on our business. On the other hand, I think we have some situations that it is better to tell a lie. For example, a lot of children believe in Santa Clause in Cristmas. A lot of children are looking forward to receiving presents by Santa Clause in Cristmas. Although adults know that the parents give the cristmas present, most of adults do not want to tell the truth so that they would not disclose the secret of Santa Clause. I think this kind of lie will not do herm for anybody. So I think that it is necessary to tell a lie in some cases.

These seems to be 2 nice deal, of course, for each one it has it's own advantages and disadvantages, I will explore it clearly before giving my opinion. I will go through the first offer, they offer us to live until 100 years old, enough for a normal life. You will be calm, with not too many attentions from citizen, you would live in the countryside, near the sea. You will hear the waves coming from the infinite ocean every morning when the sunrise. Your life is just going around the town, it is a normal town without sounds, noises from visitors. Your life start and end without the notice of people around the world. You will have a limit relation with other people on other town, incase you go for a vacation. Now, with a life of more intense, the maximum years you can live could be 65. Because it is intense, therefore 35 year minus in the longevity. You probably would live in a city, with noises and you would party every weekend, like a university students. Now, I would like to give my opinion, I would choose the second offer. I don't want to live a life without caring people, without technology, without money. I can handle the problem that I can't live long, but 65 years is enough for me to spend time, happiness and momories with my relative. I can take care of my family, but if I choose and intense life, I probably would have spare money to pay for them, from the hosue to the activities.

In my opinion, the better choice is depended on which lifestyle of each student when they brought up and studied at high school. Some of them enjoy the independent life, depend on themselves in their studies, their works, but others like to be live with their families, they hope that families always support them to achieve their goals and encourage them overcome difficultiy in life. For me, the parents should help them achieve their goals. However, they also ought to offer the good environment as they can for your kids to be mature and successful in their life. There are two reasons for me to agree with live on their own. The main reason is they can live independent so they must face - to - face the problems and solve them by their own. The important thing is they must trust themselves. They will learn the way to deal with and overcome the challenges naturally. When they live by their own, they will know and understand their parents' tough in life. From that, they would love their families more and try their best to live better. Besides, the independent life will be made them contact and interact with many people. They will learn how to maintain and have a good relationship with friends, families and people around them. They will know how to share their love, happy and lend a sympathetic ear to the poor. On the other hand, they can be keen on the things they like, the work they love and try many things new which they have not experienced yet. They ought to lead their life and make decisions for everything. They also have a chance to relax and convenient to study and folllow their educational life. It's really difficult to cope up with the homesickness in the start days when they separate their families. But if they go over that, they will be more mature and learn a lot of things. In these start days, the parents should be their friends to be broad-minder, give them some useful advice, especially encourage them to be more courage to follow the way they have chosen. In conclusion, although being alone to be mature and fell relax to achieve more in your educational life is significant to more teenagers, follow family advice and instructions to deal with any problems are important to their mature life.

On first glance it might seem tempting to choose a short and intense life for onself. 40 years, let's say, full of romance, excitement and adventure. Just skip the uncomfortable part of life when you get old and needing to be cared for. But I think this option might sound much better than it would actually turn out to be. There seldom is a life full of romance without heartbreak, and there never has been a life without any peril. To live intensely not only means to be joyous all the time, it also means to feel deep sorrow and experience crushing stress. I do not think there is a way to only amplify the positive aspects of a life without having any tradeoff and therefore I would argue someone who lives and feels intensely also faces intense hardships in their life. A long and calm life on the other hand gives you the benefit of more time, and as we all know time is the most valuable ressource there is. If you spend your time wisely there is no good reason why you would trade any of it away. A calm life doesn't need to be any less fulfilling than a short and adventureous one, as calm doesn't equate boring and living long in no way needs to get dull. There can never be enough time to spend with your family or to engage in a hobby so I would gladly take 100 years.

Of course I prefer a short life but much more intense. It's insultous for me thinking in a life which don't have anything special to do, but only to live!

I can't have respect for people who prefer to live with the help of other people and sorry for my strong words, but this kind of human beings are one the biggest disgraces in our world. I hate them with all my powers and I know that many of them can't respect our likes and they prefer to live with our taxes and our efforts. They're parasites and I respect them as human beings like me and others but they have immediately to find an honest job.

I think being healthy is more important than having a lot of money. I am not talking about only physical health, but also of mental health. However, to have money is essential to keep a healthy mind, due to the fact that to have money, principally through work and entrepreneurship, helps people to avoid stress and depression from lack of money. Logically, this works only if people working in jobs that they like, if no, rather than help people to keep a healthy mind, this will harm mental their health them. It's no use to have money if you are with a poor health. It's no use to work incessantly if you are getting stressed, frustrated, sick, and unhappy. It's important to you to have a balance between health and money. From the moment that you understand this equilibrium, you will get a thought of what the most important thing to your life is to have health, a good job, and your family beside.

As far as I'm concerned, I think the students benefit more from having different teachers throughout the years than have one teacher. First of all, having the same teacher for several years induces that the students get used to this teacher. It can be an advantage: the students know their teacher better for instance. However, the students shouldn't get to familiar. Indeed, as the students are used to their teacher, they can get deconcentrated or irreverent more easily. Besides, it depends on how the teacher works with his students. If the lesson is cool, enjoyable and still instructive for instance, then maybe having this teacher for a few years can be great. Otherwise, if the teacher is boring and his lessons uninteresting, having new teachers each year enables the students to avoid the problem of having a boring teacher. Furthermore, the differences which exist from one teacher to another can help the students to get familiarized with different ways of teaching and learning different skills . To conclude, it is a real benefit to have new teachers each year because of the differences existing between them.

Mankind has found solutions to most problems that makes our lives hard, however this solutiouns sometimes bring some issues with them. Inacitve lifestyle is one of the problems that modern lifes bring our lives. Large number of university students are suffering from inactive lifestyle, and their lives become more vulnerable constantly. I believe that every university students should make sport during the university. First of all, making sports improve students learning skills. Most studies that have been done so far today on university students indicates that students who make sports have more developed brain cells those who don't make any sports. Have strong cells is essential to learn more quickly and effectivelely. Furthermore, making sports, provides relief and it reduce stress. Less stress means more efficient learnign. Secondly, making sports give to student another important opportunity: team work. Students can learn work with each other if they make sport. There are 2 students, one of whom is making team sport and the other is don't. According to most statistic, the former student tend to work with others more than the second student. Those who say that doing sport is only waste of time and it makes you only tired are wrong. Because doing sport has various kinds of opportunies, it is essential for students. It is not a waste of time. While students do sport, they learn and share. It is not also make you tired because when people do sport certain hormons make you more energic and also happy. Therefore, doing sports has more beneficial features than we thought To sum up, Modern life is forcing us to unactive lifestyle. doing sport is the most logical solutioun to solve uncaticvity. And it is also essetnial for university students. Thus, every universty students should make sport if tehy don't want to make, then they should be encouraged to make sport.

There are different reasons why most medical doctors don't want to work in rural areas, I could just list a bunch of them right here, but I'll try to explain the ones I think as the main reasons for this phenomenon. In my opinion the poor remuneration can be seen as the main reason as all the process to become a doctor involves a lot of money and effort, so it's comprehensible that someone who passed through all these challenges expects a life with the benefits of money in a good place to live. Another important point neglected sometimes is that, as all of us, medical doctors are humans, they have the right to have this sense of belonging to a community, and to just expect they have to go to a remote place because that place needs a doctor is a naive thought. These people have families, friends, relatives, relationships that are entangled in the cities they live. These problems can be seen in different countries, poor or rich, but I believe there're some ways to help solve them. A short term solution could be more incentives so doctors would be attracted to work in these places. Another idea that comes to mind is a rotation among doctors so some of them would spend some time in these areas and return home after that. However the main and lasting solution would be an education system that gives everyone the same opportunities, so this rural areas could have medical doctors of their own, professionals attached to these communities receveing what a doctor deserves for the responsibility of caring for lives.

I think students should not have to study music, correct if it is a student choice, wrong if it is an obbligation by the school. I appreciate that in world there are schools, where studying play a musical instrument is one subject on the high of their business, but I think learn to play a musical instrument isn't an important quality in a student, to find a job or to be a good citizien in society. In high school I learnt to play guitar but when I grow up I didn't play guitar anymore, because I wasn't good. In my opinion is wrong to force students play a musical instrument if they didn't want to play some musical instuments. Not everyone who studied at schools to play an instrument will become music stars, furthermore for learn to play a musical instrument, families are forced to buy the instrument and maybe they can't afford these expenses. On the other hand, I agree with schools where students must study music, because music is an art and is correct to teach students the power of music on people, but I want to say: "stop learn to play a musical instrument, none becoming Ringo Star or John Lennon!!!"

Dear Mr. Stark, I am writing this letter to the council of our town, because I want to give my opinion about banning phones in some public places. In my honest opinion, banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaruants is not wise. At least, from my chair. As you know we are living in a free country, in a free city. You, as the government of our town, should not ban mobile phones. By doing this, you are taking part of our freedom in places such as public transport, shops and restaurants. Further going, I think that most citizens of our town would not be happy about this ban, so would I. In those places people should be allowed to do whatever they want to. Some people use to work remotely from restaurants. It may be their main source of income. No one enjoys losing their job, you or I would not too. It will be a big, hard hit in those people. There are more things why this decision is not correct and optimal for the town. One of them, is that a lot of people are learning or even surfing through out web, when they are travelling by public transport. They can learn new languages, read books, message their friends, etc. Just think about all of those things. It is pointless to waste their time by not doing anything. Summarising all the things, which I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that you will change your future decisions. Your silecerly, XYZ.

In my opinion, for students is better to have the same teacher for several years, especially for foreign languages. The reason is very simple, change teachers each year change also the study mode, the teacher pronunciation and so on. Another reason is, especially in primary school, the relationship between teacher and child is the first step of student grown, and if every year change the teacher, the children don't make a strong relationship with the teacher. If a child has the same teacher every year, he feels less in awe if he needs help. Now the teacher situation is more complex than past, because schools haven't the equipment for start a school year with teachers for all subjects, and quite all teachers have a regual job contract. Every year 50% of the teachers didn't teach in the school where she have taught last year, maybe because they prefer take lessons in a school closer to the long where they live.

My favourite season of the year is winter, due to it's the season of my birthday, I was born the Christmas day of 1995. I love winter also because I can go to ski with Andrew, my boyfriend. few people like me love winter, is unusual. In summer you can go to the beach, spending all day sunbathing but for me, the completely happiness is sit down around a table with a hot chocolate, sing Cristmas songs and waiting for opening presents behind the Cristmas tree. My friend disagree with my opinion at all, they love summer! I appreciate the summer but it's so impossible to love her, it's so hot, you can't sleep well, you doing 2 showers a day for heat.

Nowadays, young people prefer having a short but intense life to long and quiet life. I am a person who tries to live each day as if it were my last, a life full of risks is more exciting than a boring life. Personally speaking, a lot of old people have had long lives because hardly they were able to follow their dreams, during their childhood they grew up with the idea that a good life was getting married, have a job and have children. In fact, currently there are people who still have that idea of ideal live, even if they would like to try different things. Some people prefer following a predeterminate routine to follow their own aspirations. I grew up with people who told me that I should get a man beside me, I should have children before I 30 and I should serve my husband all my life. However, my idea of living is pretty different, I enjoy doing outdoor activities which makes me feel adrenaline, activities such as climbing, parachuting, skating, etcetera. I am aware that some activities could be dangerous, but it is something that worthwhile, travelling around the world is fascinating as well, visiting amazing places in remote areas, tasting exhotic fod are things that everyone should try once. In conclusion, each person has different ways to see the life and has different aspirations. We should do whatever makes us happy and that is why I would choose a short but intense life.

Nowadays it is well known that computers and tablets shouldn't replace books in schools and universities but I firmly believe that they should replace them for these reasons. Firstly it is highly essential to say that computers and tablets provide students with more amounts of knowledge than books as tablets and computers have Internet, so pupils could have access to various sources of information. As a result of that they can learn more things than reading books. Furthermore, computers and tablets have videos where information is better explained than it is in books. As a consequence of that, children could learn new things in astonishing ways thus they will have better marks. Last but not least, the information with which computers and tablets provide students are always updating so pupils aren't going to study same things all the time. Therefore, they will find studying as a rewarding activity. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers and tablets should replace books in schools and universities as it supply more knowledge to students than books, it has stunning videos where the information is explained better to students and the information about computers and tablets are always updating thus students will find studying as a pleasure activity.

Dear Sir or Madam I am writing this letter in response to the ban the use of mobile phones in public places which the town council is considering. As far as I considered, it must not be implemented but some rules or law should be necessary. It is common knowledge that mobile devices are an essential component of people's lives in this modern world and they use it almost everywhere. It is indisputable that some of them use those devices with a lack of morality and they sometimes show disrespectful behaviour. One of major issues is noise, which is caused by people who talk on the phone loudly on the bus or train, and other passengers are bothered and frustrated. Although this kind of drawbacks are paramount and should be addressed, I believe that using gadgets in public spaces has some advantages. For instance, people can do their work, check up their children, read emails and study, which can people's daily lives better and productive. For this reason, in my opinion, texting, reading and other fanctions that do not make any sounds should be allowed, in other situations, such as in a public library, shops and restaurants should also be considered. In conclusion, I object to the total ban of using mobile phones in public places. However, it would be acceptable to control the use of them with some restrictions in order to maintain public morals. Yours faithfully, A citizen

In the nineties people around the world mostly used to communicate by scriving letters. Today mobile phones have completely changed the way people communicate. Mobile phones are taken more and more importance in our life . If we look around us regardless in what part of the world we are what we notice is that the majority of people possess a mobile phone in hand . Mobile phones are extremely convenient and useful. Not only they allows us to speak in real time to our families and friends but they also allows us to rapidly get any information we need on many different topics . Today we could even say that people are addicted to mobile phones . Nobody would agree to be separate from his mobile phone. In addition to that people are inclined to excessively use their phones which is now becoming very inconvenient and highly disturbing especially in public transport, and , in shops and restaurants. Sometimes pedestrians crossed the roads without paying attention to the traffic lights which might be dangerous for themselves and for the drivers . Obviously the use of mobile phones is rising safety and security issues therefore banning the use of mobile would be somewhat unfair because it's a matter of freedom. Anyway the authorities have to undertake actions to tackle some abusive uses of mobile phones. Maybe by implementing some simple rules for the use of mobile phone in public transport.

The Doctors residence Many doctors prefer to live in big cities where they can find more opportunities to make money, whereas rural areas suffer from lackness of doctors. This problem has many crucial consequences. However, there are a number of beneficial solution to address this problem. First, the government should support these rural areas with sufficient medical supply and build big hospitals. For example, they can build one hospital in every region. Scondly, the government should provide suitable accommodation for doctors in these areas. They can build a huge compound for doctors and their families, for instance. Third, the the government can develop transportation means to help ease traveling between the village and city for doctors. Forth, because doctors are going to live there with their families, the government should pay close attention to other services, such as schools, restuarants, and shops. Moreover, the government can offer a high-salary for doctors who voluntarily decide to work at rural ares' sopital. These slotions can help limit the significant consequences cause by insuuficient medical staff in the countryside.

As we all know nowadays it's not common for people to do sports activities. It's terrifying that not many people are living healthy. It's way more common to lead an inactive lifestyle. It's obviously unhealthy. Some people say that children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week during their university and school terms. I believe that this approach is correct. But, it's not perfect either. Wanna know why? Let's begin! First of all, doing sports is healthy. I'm not talking about a sport career or something, which obviously less healthy (maybe even less healthier than not doing sports at all), but running few times a week or even every day is without any doubts beneficial for our body and mental health. It's also important for our well-being. I understand that not everyone is talented, muscular or has good genetics. You have to accept that doing sports activities in general is necessary and it brings many benefits to us. As long as you have the motivation to change your life you should do sports. Of course, there're some downsides of this idea too. I think that forcing everyone is just simply not good. There're people who are really talented and are taking sports activities seriously. We shouldn't force them to attend those classes. It's pointless. That's a huge waste of time. As we all know time is extremely valuable! We cannot buy it. Further going, at some age you realise that you won't live for ever. You discover that it's important to be healthy and do healthy things. It's not good to force students which are mature enough to understand it. They have a lot of stuff going on in their lives and I believe that they don't need anyone to tell them that. Ending our essay, I just want to summarise all the things I have mentioned above. I believe that this idea is great and necessary. It's very important to do sports activities, but we shouldn't force everyone to do them.

My favorite season of year is winter. In the city where I live, the winter begins in November and it ends in May. I like winter because I feel more productive and relaxed day after day. Because of the cold weather, going to work or university is more pleasant for me due to the fact that I don't sweat on the way and when I am working or studying. I can sleep better in the winter, and it is very important for me to keep productive throughout the day. The downside of winter in my city and state is that it causes flooding in many areas, pushing people affected move to move to other areas, leaving their houses that are flooded. The winter is very special for me. It is the season in which I feel happier and tranquil, obtaining positive results at work and in studies, despite the downside cited above.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing with regard to the possibility that the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops, and restaurants will be banned by the town council. As a citizen of this town I would like to give my opinion on this matter and give my arguments against this regulations. First of all, banning the use of mobile phones on public transport is not so good an idea. Some people do not have enough time to talk with others during the day, so when they commute it is their only chance to use the mobile phone to chat with friends or family. What is more, our town is a really popular place for tourists. I am afraid that taking this action will have a negative impact on our town's economy. As I have been talking with another citizens, they all agree that banning the use of mobile phones in shops is a very bad idea. Some people are very indecesive and they need help to choose the right products. Usually, there is not enough staff in the shop so, as a result, they phone their relatives or friends. Banning the use of phones in shops will also baldy affect the economy. Finally, I do not support the idea of banning the use of mobile phones in restaurants ,as recently there has been an increased interest in food blogging. More and more people film their food in order to earn money. Our town is famous for its restaurants that are friendly for bloggers, YouTubers, and other influencers. I strongly believe that banning the use of mobile phones is not a good idea. Overall, it will not only badly affect our economy, but it will also have a negative impact on the citizens' happiness. Yours faithfully, XYZ

Nowadays, more and more medical doctors desire to work in some cities for handsome salary instead of working in the countryside. That leads to medical employees deficiency in many rural areas which is a significant issue need interferencing by government. To solve the problem radically, we need to know about the its reasons. From my perspective, many doctors incline to give priority for big cities as their workplace by virtue of the financial benefits that rural areas can't provide them with. It is undeniable that doctors in the urban areas could be paid as three times as those in the rural places. It means that they have handsome incomes to pay their cost of livings and meet their entertain needs as well. Moreover, working in these cities bring them much opportunities to develop their careers. Many experts, prestigious hospitals and medical research centres all gather in the big cities all over the world, so it facilitates the medical doctors to develop themselves and take advantage of these benefit conditions. Another reason is that there is not many up-to-date devices in the medical facilities in the countryside. However talent the doctocs are, it is hard for them to cure their patients in these poor conditions. So, what is the solutions to that issue? I think there is always need for governments interference. They should bring in new laws that encourage the medical doctors to work in the rural areas. Maybe better compensation and benefits package will work in those cases. It secures them more stable lives and make them loyal to their work. Moreover, the government should provide the cutting-edge machines for the medical facilities in the countryside. It will be a shot in the arm that helps the doctors with their work. Besides, the clever advertisement campaigns to stimulate the sense of responsibility and love for medical work will be effective in attract labour in the rural areas. With above solutions, I believe that the issue will be dealt with radically. Keeping medical labour source balanced in both of rural and urban area is really important thing in developing the whole country.

Firstly, it is absolutely essential to say that thanks to video games children have developed their logical skills as video games test children to sort out arduous dungeons. As a result of that, they could improve their logical abilities so much. However, meet new people is other profit of video games as thanks to them children can enlarge their social ties. As well as that, they can meet stunning friends for playing with them and spending awesome time. Last but not least, improvement of creativity is another benefit from playing video games as they have a creativity mode in where players are allowed to create everything they want.

In conclusion, video games have a positive impact on children seeing that they can improve their logical abilities, they can also meet astonishing friends and improve their creativity.

Nowadays it is well known that zoos are great places for people to learn about animals but I absolutely believe that animals belong in nature and it is awful to keep them in zoos for these reasons. Firstly, it is highly essential to say that animals live more comfortably in nature than in zoos as they can have a lot of space for moving and living wild. As a result of that, they can hunt their dams freely. Furthermore, in nature animals can build their own habitat for living without taking care of the crowded space that they have in zoos. As a consequence of that, they can live indepently and more blissful than in zoos where they are kept an eye. Last but not least, the survival of animals in nature should be mentioned as in these places animals survive more than in zoos as they have a better life conditions than zoos in where they are locked up and anxious. In conclusion, I strongly believe that animals should live in nature as in there they could live more comfortably, they don't have crowding space for moving and they can survive longer than if they live in a zoo where they feel too isolated.

Undoubtedly, being sedentary is extremely harmful and unhealthy for human beings. As a result, some people claim that pupils who are normally and physically inactive should be required to do sports activities three times a week to improve their health. As far as I am concerned, I partly agree with this idea as it has proven advantages of exercise. On the other hand, doing sports activities should be regarded as personal will and it should not be obligatory. All my points why we should or should not support this obligation will be addressed below. Not only can exercise reduce the opportunity of having a critical illness but also help with concentration and mental issues. It has been reported that after exercising, our bodies will reduce insulin resistance and reduce inflammation, and it results in a decrease in diabetes or opportunity of other diseases. Additionally, our brain will release chemicals, such as endorphins, which help relieve pain and stress. The positive effects of regular exercise can be far better than we anticipate; because of that, we should suggest young learners do physical activities as frequently as they can. It has been convinced that adequate sports activities can bring countless merits from physical and mental perspectives by some scientists. On the other hand, we should still respect those learners’ willingness to do physical activities, as if we are concerned about adolescents with physical challenges who may not be able to act like normal students. This decision could be not reasonable and will turn into a torture for those teenagers with disabilities unless those students will be exempted from this rule. To sum up, in my view, the compulsory sports activities three times a week are not essential for all young students, in spite of some gained benefits from doing them. In contrast to making regulations, we should encourage the most students to do exercise spontaneously and educate them the importance of sport instead.

In some schools, students must study music and learn how to play a musical istrument, in my personal opinion is a terrific idea, in other schools may not be required what I think it is not good for the students. schools in develop countries teach music to students as part of the subjects. it is important to learn how to play a music instrument because it improve our discipline. In countries where education is priority and have the best students, they must study music and play at least one instrument. I had studded music when I was in high school and I can play the guitar. but not all have the same opportunity in my country schools usually not teach music. In my personal experience learn how to play an instrument was very healpfull to my personal enheance. Music is part of the culture of the country and it is part of the history of the citizes. I hope that in the future our congresists may use their power to make laws that insentive schools to orginize music classes.

Everyone is different. Everyone preffers different things. Everyone is crazy about differenet things. Everyone simply differs. There are people who would prefer to live a long, calm life until 100 years old. But, there are also those who would prefer a shorter life, but much more intense. When it comes to me, I would defienetly choose the first option. To be honest with you, I'm not really a social person at all. I do not like talking to people too much, hanging with them, or even texting with them. I am, what it is called today, an introvert type of a person. I would 100 percent agree with them. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against people who prefer to be partying and chilling with friends all the time. For me it's just a better option. Let me explain why! First of all, I would not enjoy dying in my early age's. I think that nobody would. You see, having a long life is pretty nice. When you are partying or doing those type of things, it's really easy to fall into a bad group, which will hustly ruin you. If you are not aware of it, you will probably start taking drugs as a teenager. Maybe it will be more intense, but I don't think that dying before your 30s is an enjoyable thing. Further going, when you live a long, calm life it is more likely that you will get more from it overall. It is way easier to travel, experience things, enjoy life and simply live, when you are not stuck to a bad 24/7. It's the most important thing in your life. Sumarising, I think that living a long and a calm life is a better and safer option for all people.

Travel in the future will be more comfortable, fast, and safe. With technological advances, people will have many ways to travel, including virtual travel to another place through simulation of the desired place. One of the factors that will impact the way of how people will travel is Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence will help travel companies to better understand their travelers, and this will be used as a first attendance to customers. Among the things I believe will not change are planes, trains, buses, and ships as the means of transport most used to travel. I don't see other means of transport being used more than these in the future. I need to detach the space travel. In recent years, we're seeing a growth of interest in that type of travel. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin plan to transport people to other planets. This will have an amazing and thunderous impact on the world.

I agree with people that believe animals belong in nature and they don't deserve to be trapped in zoos. I know it's important that people to visit animals in zoos in order to get to know them better and how they behave. But, animals are born to be free creatures, having all their life in their natural habitat. From the moment that you remove animals from their natural habitat and take them to zoos, the animals end up losing their wild behavior and it is dangerous because when the animals back to their natural habitat, they don't know anymore how to act in that environment. It is necessary to highlight an exception. Many species of animals are running the risk of extinction, and the zoos, in this case, are important environments to preserve these species. Therefore, if the animals are being kept in the zoos because they are in the extinction process and they need care for reproduction, so I believe the zoos must be kept for this purpose.

Music classes tend to be eliminated in schools gradually because more and more teachers and heads prefer their students to learn academy than art. They think they're right with their ridiculous reason that learning music cannot make their student pass into a good university. That's a lie. Honestly, we should add music classes into every grade in school because of the wonderful advantages of music for people who have a connection with it. Playing instruments, singing, and even just listening to music are good ways to relax after all depressions that students get in school's academic class. And we cannot imagine completely the power of music in connecting people together. A shy boy may not feel confident in the crown or normal conversations, but he will be a different one with music. No criticisms, no ego, just music. There are so many reliable researches show that music is good for improving our brains and mental health. According to scientists, playing instruments is an amazing way to develop brain functions. In other words, we will more intelligent, clever, and reduce Alzheimer disease's risks when we get older if we can play at least an instrument or even just learn how to play it. We don't need to discuss or demonstrate the benefits of music for mental health because it's totally clear. Every single people from the young to the old feel the same way when they listen to any kind of music. Rhythm can touch all corners of our souls. Music is a significant treatment for patients used by the psychological doctor. How can we ignore its benefits to students just because some people think it's not necessary? Schools should balance academic classes and art classes in student's timetables to get the best effect in teaching and learning.

Nowadays it is well known that some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university but I absolutely believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to studying abroad. Firstly, it is highly vital to mention disadvantages of studying abroad as sometimes it could be too heavy to students as they have to study in a foreign language. As a result of that, they couldn't find this experience awesome at all. However, studying abroad has great advantages too, such as meet stunning friends, learning new cultures and improve your foreign language. As well as that, students will have an outstanding experience travelling abroad. Besides, it also could be an enriching epxerience as they will know different people whom helps them for improving their language skills. To summarize, I highly believe that studying abroad is a superb idea for all the students as advantages outweight disadvantages.

The Exercise it is something nesssary to our bodies it helps us to focus and be healthy. In this essay I am going to write the importance of exercise for children and teachers at school. exercise it is the best way to improve your physical health , your memory and your psychology. The reason why is that we need children to do some work out in the schools even if are forced because nowadays there are a lot of opesity that children 's education for example sitting around the computer for more than two hours a day it harms their body they can't walk and they will have problems in their ilness like obesity , eyes problems and psychology problems like depression etc. On the other hand not doing exercise will get them a lot of illness like they will have a low energy as a result of that they willl have a low spirits. Another thing that children might have is isolation so without they will not be able to make relationship such as their classmate and their teachers. As an adult it is important to do exercise every day at least ten minute because the more you don't do exeri the bad health you might get especially when threeten years old believe me if you don't do exercise you will have a lagre bag of medicine that you will need to carry out with you everyday. In regards to the doing according to my own research I found out is that people who do exercise every day they become more stronger, happier and they lived long years because they look after them selves and listen to their bodies. To sum up I will end up with this saying healthy body in healthy mind always take care of yourself.

As a student who has learnt for 12 years includes living at home with my family for 9 years and living on my own for 3 years, I think that living independently is hard but the better choice. When we move away and live by ourseflves, there are various problems will appear such as money, time management, balancing learning and working and security. Money is a first and biggest issue when we live without family. We have to pay for everything, even something we didn't think about when we were living at home like toileties, ingredients, cleaners, etc.. In fact, some little needy things in a house for a normal live cost very much in total. And when you have more things you have to do than just studying and working since you still lived with your family like going for groceries, cooking, cleaning, etc., it takes so much time of you and one important thing is that you have to learn how to manage your time and balance your studying at school and working for your living. Living independently is really hard and challenging, but if you can do it well, you will realise that you are more mature, independent, confident, responsible than an old version of you when you lived with your parents. You know how to order your life, and be a reliable and decisive person. No one can live with us forever, even our parents. Instead of try to live with family as long as possible, living by your own to develop yourself and make your parents believe in you.

Dear principal, I would like to talk my opinion about your idea. I was thinking about the requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work is not a correct thing, because the volunteer work is an important thing and need a lot of responsibility. People need to do because they want to help someone, not because they have to do that. I already did volunteer work in some hospitals and asylums, and it is a serious things, there are a lot of rules and we need to be kind and emphatic I choose do that, no one forced me. So was a very good experiation, but I would like to do, I think that volunteer work could be encourage, like show a video like the movie Patch Adams that it is a very beautiful story and my inspiration The people need to help for making a difference not only for graduation, these people that only do things for receive an award could be rude and a bad idea for someone that need help. I hope you understand my opinion about this subject. Best regards, Ju

Whetever students decide to leave and live by theymself or stay at their parents's house both have positive and negative aspects. For example, students who move out could face difficutlties such as working and paying the rent while their still attending courses and preparing exams. This type of life can surely make them grow and be more responsible but it can also over stress them and put too much on their shoulders, which a 20 years old person could not be ready to manage it. Otherway staying at parents' house could be easy in terms of organisation or money management, but even in this case there could be some problems such as the stress generated by the college's life and dealing with your parents every day. The important things is that young students takes the responsibility for their actions and choose wisely the road they decide to fallow.

This last year showed everyone how crucial being active is. Studies show that a majority of people gained weight during pandemic and what is more their conditon also decreased. For some sport was difficult before the pandemic, therefore, is it necessary to force evryone to do sport 3 times per week? What if schools came up with the solution, which will suit everyone abilities? In my opinion this enforcement might be good, if children could indivitualy choose what they want to do. It is well known that these days people especially students don't have enough time for extra activities. School work is consuming almost every minute of their lives, which should concern the government. PE is one of the most unlikable subject among teens; they experience trauma from bullying, some are forced to do activities above their abilities, and the key thing is - everyone is different but the system grades them the same. Authorites probably want good by forcing to exercise, however they should focus on minimalising study hours or how to adjust them to everyone. On the other hand, those 3 PEs per week might be the only form of activity they get during a week. Nowadays we can assume that this is true, yet shaming pupils for that create a possibilty that in the future they will develop disgust to any kind of physical movement. That is why, as a society we should show more appealing side of sport so that we don't have to force them to participate in those lessons. All in all this statement has two sides - good one and a bad one. Idealy students will be in shape, including those for whom sport at school is the only form of activities. Nevertheless individuals who aren't keen on doing sport might become traumatised and never 'touch' it again.

To get quality sleep, you need at least 8 hours of sleep. I'll be able to sleep 8 hours only if my room is quiet and dimly lit.

We live in a world that supposively revloves around self-care. The widespreading tendency these days though, is lack of physical work. How often do we ran into a person, especially young, who exercises regularly? Sadly, to majority of adolescence minds, there are other, more meaningful prorities in life than health. Quite thought-provoking solution with a view to terminating this baffling speculation is to make all students and children exercise. Firstly, it is generally held that lacking in physical exercising equals struggling with health. Furthermore, I believe that modern technology is a nail to teenagers' tomb. The fact that perfectly illustrates it is their frequent preferences of spending their leisure time on Instagram rather than cycling or jogging. Isn't that frustrating? What's more, from the psychological standpoint, an order of exercising at least 3 times per week can be motivating for young. What I mean is, as soon as they set their aim, they allow themselves to gain self-confidence which is maintained as utterly useful at their age. Referring to my previous arguments, another convincing fact is that teenagers and students can be sometimes overly careful with their future lives. Keeping in mind that sport facilitates them to maintain a healthy lifestyles, exercising will benefit them well perhaps in 10 years view. On the other hand, however, forcing kids to exercise can cause dreadful anxiety because of the pressure they'd be putten into. Vitally, in my view, more effective way would include conversations with young people, lessons and articles encouraging them to take up some sport. Taking everything into consideration, I come to the conclusion that awareness about the benefits of exercising should be spread among children and students. This way, it is highly likely that they will naturally decide to become athletic all by themselves. By and large, surely, exercising at least 3 times a week is recommended for them!

Most medical doctors want to work in the cities so their salary is more than work in the countryside. This means in the rural areas there aren't enough doctors. So what are the reasons for this problem here and how to improve it? In my opinion, they want to work in the ciites because the salary was paid in the countryside was lower than in the cities, therefore they all want to work in the metropolis. I know that, everyone all loves money but each person use money for different purpose. So do the medical doctors. Because of this so there aren't enough physicians in the rural areas. There are some civilians live in the mountainous areas. If they have some problem, they could not go to the hospital in time. Therefore, they have to die. To me, the best way to solve out this problem is all doctors will get the same salary, even though in the cities and countryside. When a medical student becomes a doctor, he or she all has an opinion is "I have to work in the big hospital." So, I hope that our government spends more money to build more hospitals in remote areas. Pay for the physicians the same as the doctors in the cities. Mobilizing young medical dotors to work there and tell them that in the rural areas we need doctors more than ever.

There are two chief types of office design nowadays: separating employee's workstations into different cubicles and putting no divider between them. From my perspective, I would prefer to the first one rather than the latter due to its prominent advantages. First of all, enclosed workstation tends to enhance focus abilities of white-collar workers. They could not be distracted by externalities such as a coworker's action when there is a divider between them from other employees. As a result, their work quality will increase and improve a lot. Moreover, the workers can be insured about their privacy in the office. The walls separating employees from their co-workers play the role as the wardens for their own houses. There, they can freely do anything that comforts them without being afraid of anyone else. A real life example, a man who is forgetful can stick some sticky notes on the one side of wall although his colleague like them or not. That also helps them avoid some embarrassing situations. So, workers can work in a good mood which has a positive effect on their work performances. Another reason is that the walls make the office look more tidy and aesthetic. They keep employee's workstations in the right order and lessen the risk of taking the wrong things of other people. Bottom line, the enclosed workstations facilitate the employee comprehensive. Making them more concentrate on their work, insuring their privacy, keeping the workplace formal is the thing that makes this type superior to others.

I guess what I'm writing is something that the bulk of students do not agree, but my favourite season is autumn. I really like it for large reasons and the most important is that I like the atmosphere with a touch of sadness and the grey sky, and I love when weather is not hot and there's no more dryness around. I like the weather turns fresher and wet. For me autumn is a metaphore of life with the days becoming progressively shorter and the nature looses their colours. I think people is a little weak and they undergo the darkness of autumn, but this is a wrong attitude, and all of us should begin to love the less bright seasons. As well as, I 'm happy to come back to school where I have steady relationship and school let me a steady growth.

I would prefer to having the new teachers each year. First, I think it good to meat a new thing every year. Bul, maybe it good if we have some teacher that you close with and you can talk to them every year. That teacher not always is the teacher that you study with it maybe come from club that you it and maybe the teacher that you met with coincident can give you more comfortable than teachers that you study with. And, the important thing is teachers doesn't always good and it maybe better is you can change and bet that new teacher ie better than you previous one. Another reason that I think is really important is we can prevent the teacher that use his cralisma to influence student. This situation can come to the great disauster for both student and teacher. Although this is not a good way to prevent this but who know it not good enough.

It is a true that book is an important part when you study, bring to you knowledge about the world. Also, with the development of technology, e-book was invented and became popular as books. With e-books, student can study everywhere with their computers or tablets. However, e-book shouldn't replace books in schools and universities. First, to use e-book we need Internet connection, so this may a bad thing for students to study without it. For example, when students go somewhere there is no Internet connection but they have to search for information, so they can't find anything. Second, everyone knows that using computers or tablets too much can harm your eyes, so when you use e-book can harm your eyes. Finally, using computers or tablets can make you distraction because you may use another app, not really concentrate on study. In conclusion, e-book has been brought lots of benefits to us, but it shouldn't replace books

Nowadays, it is well known that high schools and universities are implementing more and more requirements in order to graduate, and despite most students' disagreament, I would rather see those as great opportunities to challenge them and help them improve and gain a wide variety of skills. Firstly, it is undeniable that students' schedules are usually really occupied, so volunteering could be a quite wished experience for them although they might not get round to do it. As a result, making that activity mandatory, may be something positive and enjoyable for them while it is academically necessary. Secondly, the fact that volunteer work fosters better people and bounty is also an important point to consider because they will be feeling great doing some charity work or giving their help, which at the same time will help their mental health and calmness as many studies have shown. Last but not least, the job experience they will be acquiring throughout that time should be mentioned since it will be something such useful and remarkable that they will not forget about it. For instance, the communication skills, the social interactions, team work abilities... In conclusion, from my point of view, requiring students to complete volunteer work in order to graduate is a great way to help them to become more professional, better people and gain regarded skills.

I think playing can give both positive and negative impact. It depend on how the children use it. It not wrong if children play video game many people in my country play video game for learning language and it definitely work. You can play video game and learning language in the same time. Now, we can consider playing video game like a sport since, we have an r-sport and it getting bigger and bigger. If you consider it practice until you are the goog player you can do it it term of sport. But many people can't make it to that position and not all video game that they consider like sport then I think it also important that you have to arrange what time you play and what time you don't.

Essentially what you are asking is if one would choose a short life of intimacy, home and family versus a fast paced life of sensation, never forming long lasting intimate relationships and flittering from one thing to the next in search of adventure and excitement. The choice is crystal clear. A slow, short, boring life but one filled with the real intimacy of a true partner; the love and nurturing of a family, pets and causes and development of real and loyal friendships beats the fast life of loneliness, ships that pass in the night, quick trust and quicker betrayals; the excitement of adventure, shared alone or with strangers, the duplicity and fickleness of the limelight. The answer is clear, just as George Bailey learned in "It's a Wonderful Life." You can never put a price on real love, trustful intimacy or the knowledge that there are friends who will be there when you call. It's boring sometimes, and the duty is often tedious but when you go to bed at night you are not alone, in your soul. The other way leads to alcoholism and extreme experience, drug abuse, divorces, loneliness and suicide. Just look at the lives of the stars and famous, all seeking that trust and intimacy and finding only betrayal and loneliness. No wonder they turn to hard drugs - they are committing slow suicide, passing the time oblivious to their aloneness while they are nodding off, waiting to die, wishing for someone to love them, truly love them, for who they are, not what they represent or can do to advance the careers of other ambitious wannabees. Everyone is different but you may someday agree that a normal life is equal to or more fulfilling than an intense life. Have been fortunate to spend years traveling and enjoying new experiences but take the greatest pride in professional and family life. Will gladly take even just 50 years of waking up most mornings without a hangover and instead spending time with family.

As to all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week, I personally agree with this idea. I think that one of the merits of doing sports is to make people healthy. And I also think that it is no problem that you choose sports what kind of sports you want to do. For example, you can choose walking, jogging, swimming and do such sports at least 3 times per week, it will make you healthy. From my experience, when I was a high school student, I belonged to the Judo club in our high school. At that time I practiced 5 times per week, from Monday to Friday, sometimes we had a test match with other high school students on Saturday and Sunday. By this experience, I could improve my Judo skill and train my body. At the same time I could understand how it is important to continue to train myself everyday both in sports and in study. So I think that it is important for young people to do sports at least 3 times per week. l think that one of the merits of doing sports is to be able to make friends by doing sports. Some sports are team playing sports, such as football, baseball, etc. And some sports are individual playing sports, such as swimming, jogging, etc. By doing even individual sports, I think we can make friends who likes the individual sports. From my points of view, when I was a university student, I joined a ski club in our university. In the ski club, some were very good at skiing, some werer just novice for ski. Furthermore, there were some foreigners in the ski club. So I could make a lot of friends in the club so that I could communicate with many members which had different cultural back ground, so that I could understand how important of the diversity.

I agree with the second opinion. I think it wrong to keep the animal in the zoos. All animal belong to the nature and no one have a right to keep them in zoos. I think zoos have many problems. First, I think no one wants to live in the cage or the small room. If you can't imagine then try to imagine that you have in the prison and you do nothing wrong. I think it not fair to let any animal in the place they don't want and don't belong. There are many ways that you can learn about animal such as you can go and find them in the nature. I think if you see animal living in the nature once you naver want to go to zoos again. Second, many zoos have a problem with hygiene. It bad to let animal to live in the terribal place. If you think it right to keep animal in zoos to study them I think there are best if you study them in real nature.

I think the best advantages is study another country it can give you an experience that you can find in your country and you can go to a country that can offer your best study solution. It can give you understand another culture, politics and way of living. I think it can make you more understand what another culture think. It makes you the vision than you can't find in your living country. Sometimes it gave you an experience that you never think you will receive. But, you need to open your mind because if you don't you can't understand what other people think. And, the disadvantages is sometimes people can't live in the culture their don't familiar with and it can make them feel bad about themselves. The most important thing is it can fool your with the good thing that you can't have in your country and it make you look down to the people in your country. It makes you think you're better than rest of the people in your country.

Thanks to the extension of communication networks and the promotion of the Internet over the last two decades, a new way of learning has appeared. Online learning is a system that is much more flexible and adaptable to different ways of living. Thanks to the increase in resources and materials available, studying online is now a viable option for most people, as well as adapting to people's different schedules and lives. Now it is easier to find information about your chosen topics and you have less rigid schedules,and you are able to find a course which fit your needs. On the other hand, the individual's demands should be higher. Now, it is up to each person to find the motivation and to follow up, trying to find areas without distraction and to take advantage of the available moments. So, as I recently discovered a new website to improve your writing, which is called write&improve where I can write and rewrite my own composition at various levels (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) forcing you to improve your grammar and write about some subjects and topics. Although this way of learning sometimes is not easy to follow up and continue working because you have to do homework yourself, If you plan well and motivate yourself, you can improve day by day. Write & improve method is helping to adapt and incorporate new grammar in my English level.

Books and Technology Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? That question has been making for so long and so far nobody has a concrete answer to give. My personal opinion is no, computers and tablets should be complementary to each other. I believe people need to handle books, flip through the pages. I think it is part of the learning process. When people hold a book, they can feel closer to the book than when they just touch a cold, black screen. Although some researchers have said that tablets and computers should replace books at school, I disagree with them. But I know children need to face new technologies to be accustomed with it because, certainlly, they'll use it in some time of their lives. Otherwise, using a computer or tablets maybe can be good to the environment. Think about how many sheets of paper you will avoid printing with you use any sort of technology to read something, mostly not important things. In short, I'd say there are lots of pros and cons about this idea.

When I was a child, my relatives used to ask me what I wanted to be when I was older. My answer hasn't been what they wanted listening to. As I said "biologist" or "volleyball player," my cousins answered "a medical doctor." It is obvious which one had the more attention later. I think this episode might help us to understand the first question. A lot of medical doctors don't do what they do because they love this. The truth is: they love the money that working as a medical doctor can offer for them. From this logic, although we found the key of the problem another questions are formed, such as "how it can solve it?." Sometimes, I think what kind of society we had if every career earned the same salary. Would we have a lot of people wishing to become medical doctors? I'm sure we don't. To other hand, inside this same logic, I'm also sure that all medical doctors who have still chosen this career would be the ones who would work everywhere, because they love what they do. Although this problem seems easy to be solved, it's not. To change the society's thought for we could finally have a fearer world where we might work doing what we like, make us changing our way of life (witch means our perception about money and happiness). The medical doctor's problem is just a piece of the hole problem in the modern society

By my knowledge it is not much different from memories of my parents and I think that it ain't different from memories of their grandparents. They had been sitting in a classroom and in front of them had been their teacher lecturing. Of course there are some differences. Teachers can use projectors and televisions and maybe students can type their notes on their laptops. But the princip is the same. So I don't expect much differences. I am afraid just about the content of the subjects. I fear today cancel culture because it leads to the totality.

It wouldn't be holiday to me if I just lay at the beach and ddo nothing other than eat, drink and sleep. I need to stay active even on my holiday. So one of the best holiday ever had taken place few years ago in souther Czechia. I had been there with a great group of friends. We had spent a few days at dam Lipno. The we had borrowed bikes and during the day we were cycling through the beautiful Šumava mountains. After a few days we had replaced bikes for canoes and went down the river Vltava for the rest of the week. So after a little bit grueling few days of cycling we switched to more relaxing canoes in time of sunny weather. The best thing about going down the river like Vltava is that it is not boring activity but is not much demanding either so you can afford to have a great time and drink a little. In the end it was one of the best weeks I can remember. I know that it can't be repeated but I hope that I will be able to undertake something new in a similar spirit.

I am writing to you regarding your question about the general practicians (GB), who would rather work in the cities. I guess, that one of the major reasons is that those doctors would prefer to get much money for their efforts. The second reason, about which I usually think that they are people who could learn hard to get certificates, however they could not yet learn enough about good manners, which every one especially the GB must have. The general practicians are rarely not kind but some of them need being brought up by their parents well, because niether the schools do teach them personal personality nor do the universites. I think, the quickest solution for this matter is that the universities should have school subjects that encourage the student to be good guys, who can do some good deeds for no reasons but for being good doctors. I would mention one more reason, before I close this blog. The governments usually build the hospitals in the cities, that is why the GB like working next to the hospitals, which they worked in before. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to write my opinion.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you concerning your question about workstation building types. I think there is no need for any employee in any career to have noise during his work. In other words. If the employee has noise, he will have a disadvantage at his work and he won't be able to do his work properly as well as if he has a quiet working environment. It might be better for the employees to move from section to another one to bring or to get something form other company sides but it is such a tiny advantage in comparison to the disadvantage by having noise at work. In the case to have independence from others desires to listen to the radio or speaking with each other. It can be devoided by having walls between the rooms or between the workstations. If the fabric has walls between the sections, the doors can be opened or closed. However if there are no walls, the space must be always opened and the noise can easily be heard by the co-workers, who work relativ wide away from the noise resources. I thank you for giving me a chance to express my opinion.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you concerning your question about the volunteer work. Some careers are highly dependent on society. The employees and the workers, who have to work with people, should be tested in many, if they are nice enough to deal with people. Some times the employees are harsh. Those kind of people are not suitable to work in some careers. The beauty of a society can be shined by testing those people before being graduated. Otherwise the harsh people can be employed by an inistute, school, university or an organisation, which need nice people more than engineers and good graduated people. Nowadays some graduated students do not have any thing to deal with their families, their friends, their neighbours or their colleagues. In this case they live like the robotics and do not have emotions enough to show the cosumers or the clients a smile. They just do their tasks like a machine. In some cases the employers are not able to test the employees during the interview, that is why the preparing a good generation of kind and nice employees is upon the sholders of the university and the inistute. Otherwise some countries could be beyond modern in conparison to others not because of the newest technologies but because the kind and suitable people who work in the suitable places. Those people can lead the organisations to help people not to damage them. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my opinion about this mutter. This issue is not easy to think about, but it is such an important to discuss.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you concerning your interesting question about the music class. I have asked myself several times, what the music class gave me during the primary and the secondary school? I unfortunately always answer the same answer. NOTHING. Really nothing. If I were allowed to go home and rest, it would have been an encouragement for me to learn more or to finish my homework early. If the music class were a class, during which the student could utter question, the student would not have wasted long time to ask their parents to solve some complicated issues in the evening. Someone may says, what if a student will be an artist? Well, every single young student was bothered by teaching him music due to one or two students and he was not able to recognize, that he was losing months and years from his most inmportant time ever. Otherwise, if the school taught the students every thing they need in their future, the school would have much more classes every day to fulfill their desires. If someone says, that the music makes fun, the response to this expression is that the sport makes more fun for the students and it is healthy. The students, who dislike music, are much more than the students who dislike sport. If someone says, that if we have to change every class the students do not like, we will change more classes. The reply to this expression is that there is big difference between teaching the kids to brush their teeth despite hate it and it is healthy for them and teaching the kids how to kiss the dogs cats and it is not healthy at all to do it. I thank you for giving me this opportunity.

Hello everyone. I am writing to you regarding your question about students living place. I think every choice had pros and cons. It is difficult to say that one option is definitely better than another one. The living on one's own has some advantages. For example the students are more free an independent on their families. They can orgenize what they want to do during their days. However they have to manage every thing they need at home. For example washing, cleaning and buying the necessary things. If the students can live with other students and they can learn from each other, it will be not too difficult to pass the examinations. The living with the family may be good thing to do if the student like communicating with people after uttering his tasks. But if the family does not have time to speak with him, the situation will be the same as if he lives alone. It depends on the study the student does. It takes to long time, if every study section has to be explained. On the end of the day every student must find the best way to make his study easy to be graduated. I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to utter my opinion about this issue.

One of my favourite activities is sleep since almost every time I sleep. I will get a dream. Dreaming is like my second world. I can do everything in my dreams. Every day I sleep around 8-10 hours. I like to sleep in a dark room. I always turn off my lamp when I sleep except when I feel afraid of something like a ghost or robber. I'll turn on my small light. If I sleep with other people who can't sleep in a dark room, I'll get some fabric usually, my scarves closing my eyes. So it reduces the light. Noises, mostly I don't have any problem with it. I can sleep even among crowds. Nevertheless, sometimes I can't sleep even because of a light disruption. But it happened rarely. I remember I enjoy my sleep while listening to children who sing by the mosque's speaker. They sing it badly. When they stopped, I woke up and hard for me back to sleep.

A number of people probably think that they should be honest all the time as much as possible. However, those from adults to children need to tell a lie sometimes and I believe it is essential for human beings to do so as well. In the first place, there are fewer people who would like to tell lies in many cases. For example, a worker was late for the meeting due to the fact that he or she could not wake up that day. If they told their manager the truth honestly, they might have a problem. However, the only thing they need to say is they ware late because of transport or something, which might not make the situation worse. In the second place, people tell a lie to beloved such as a member of the family or a friend, if necessary. To give an example, many hasbands may buy a gift for his wife as a surprise after work by saying that he would not come back home by dinner time. That moment will enhance their relationship among family members. Finally, when people think they should be polite to others, they need a lie. For instance, one of passengers on a train may give their sheets to the elderly or pregnant women, even if they are tired and they will tell that please have a seat. That can be treated as a white lie. In conclusion, people may tell a lie even if they are not willing to. Hwever, in my opinon, I am convinced that telling a lie could take a major role in our lives if they make use of it properly.

This is a hard question to answer. I will try to answer. Let's focus on the two options. Living a long life is maybe the best choice, because it does not go far from what our real life is. Yes, it is very comfortable because you know you can do whatever you want without any consequences. You will grow up very slowly, make a family with your lover, you have also a lot of time for searching your dream job. Instead, having a shorter life is a choice that everyone will probably make. Because it can make you a cool guy, but it is not so for me. I think that what you can do in a short period of time you will be able to do it much better in a long time life. For example I imagine a short life with a lot of trips across the world with my friends or other people but I know that I do not need a short life to enjoy these trips. I will probably choose to have a shorter life only if someone promises to turn me into a famous person that can change something in our world or do something that can help a lot of people. In conclusion, I choose to continue living my life as it is now.

In my case, I really need a quiet room and no light at all. Before I got into deep sleep cycle, I can get awake easily and it takes quite a long time staying in bed before literally sleep. Usually what helps is reading a book and turn off all your electronic devices, because they produce a quimic substance in our brains that keep you awake. There are people who suggest nature sounds playlists to help them to sleep and relax, as an example rainforests or waterfalls. I guess there's no silver bullet for the ideal sleep, every body has a different system and the trick is learn how your own work.

It's not food that you eat as the main dish. This food is more like a snack but a heavy one. The main ingredients of Seblak are kerupuk, chilli and aromatic ginger. Kerupuk is like a chip made from tapioca flour. We use the raw one. Usually, I add onion and garlic to level up the taste. I like Seblak because it's spicy. I use many chillies within because I love the hottest of spicy food. The other thing is there is a unique taste from the aromatic ginger.

The phenomenon of globalization and the recent improvement of public transport have increased people's desire to start learning new foreign languages. Compared to the past, learning new foreign languages ​​is now more important than before because today's world is much more competitive and faster than in the past. The market has become global rather than local with a high desire of highly specialized workers with a good knowledge of foreign languages. Nowadays, workers should know at least two or more foreign languages ​​if they want to make a career and be competitive. In the past it was only true for a small circle of workers, such as scientists or those who wanted to work in the academic field in general. Learning new foreign languages has become important these days also due to the recent improvement of transport. Nowadays, getting from point a to point b is easy and cheap, and people are encouraged to do so. Foreign languages ​​are useful in this situation and prevent you from falling into unpleasant situations.

I think that students don't need to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. Being a volunteer you have to do it voluntarily, no one force you to do that. Maybe there are some students, they disagree with that opinion but they have to do because they want to be graduate. In high schools, students have to study a lot, teachers give them lots of homework. They don't have time to rest, so when could they go volunteering? If you want them to be a volunteer, first you don't give them the requirement:" Students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate." Just tell them that:"Be a volunteeer is optional. If you want to, do it. If you don't, no problem." Secondly, you have to pay a ertain amount of money appropriate to their volunteer work. They will have energy to be a volunteer. Because, no one on the world won't do anything without something paying back. Third is, decrease their homework therefore they will have time for volunteering. The time they are volunteering becomes happier and meaningful, if you organize some games. Who complete this work fastest will get extra money. They will interested in their works and volunteers will increase suddenly

The transport sector has started to fundamentally change the way people will move. We can expect the vehicles to drive autonomously without any human interaction and to be as comfortable as our home in the future. In ordinary journeys, vehicles with internal combustion engines, normally powered by fossil fuels, will no longer be used because electric vehicles will replace them. An advantage in the use of electric motors will be the possibility of having a quieter city with cleaner air, two key aspects nowadays. Among ordinary people, we shouldn't expect changes as shown in science fiction movies, flying vehicles will not be driven by everyone. Currently, flying vehicles are only used by astronauts with the aim of space exploration, but in the future, people will be able to travel from one planet to another to spend some days on holiday or business affairs. The cost of the trip will not yet be affordable for everyone, but we can expect prices to drop year after year. So, we just have to wait to see what happens.

English is now the second language of many people living in Europe, America and Asia. Governments pushed the learning of the English language several decades ago and it is now referred to as a "lingua franca." It means that it is commonly used as a means of communication by people of different native languages. Learning English has become important because the business and travel sectors started to support and promote it and without its knowledge, you are now left out. From a business point of view, English is used in everyday life to communicate with clients, prospective clients, give support, advertise and even communicate with colleagues within the company in large corporations. Today English is a highly sought after skill and has become the minimum requirement in many job applications. Analyzing the traveling side, English has become the "Swiss Army Knife" because it can be used to travel across countries with different native languages ​​without the problem of the language barrier. English can be used to ask for information, ask for help or just order food and someone on the other side can understand you. English has made our life easier.

The television purpose, in the historical moment we are living, is mainly a source of entertainment and less for educational purposes. When television was created, the aim of the invention was to replace the radio, which was used as a means of communication to inform about the events of the day and to broadcast radio programs such as concerts at certain times of the day. In the past, broadcasters started to invest in television programs that were not just for entertainment and news purposes, but also programs to educate children and adults. The reason why TV broadcasters moved in that direction may be due to the educational level of the people who lived at that time. Using television as a means of education works, but today the situation is completely different and we have many ways in which we can learn new things. Human creativity has been able to create successful television shows that can teach people of all ages, but that's not the future of television. The television purpose in the future will be primarily for entertainment only, as evidenced by the television content we can see today.

I have a lot of problem with English I have been studying since two years ago and I feel that I have much problem with that. The area that I would like to improve because to know English is very important when you have a job as mine. You depend on English because you have to talk with other people that they don't talk Spanish and you must know how communicate with them. It is also important because if you want to travel to another country you need to know speaking English this is a matter of stablishing a fluent conversation. In fact and global term, to learn English is something that I can to master because it has becoming like a part of my life and part of my daily routine. I believe that I am going to learn more language when I finish to learn English. The third question is very important because many people wanted to learn something but they don't have any effort to fulfill that and I think that if you want to achieve something you need to effort and sacrifice a lot of things to achieve that. So I study every day, I dedicate much hour of my dairly life to improve and to learn something new. I am also practicing because if you only study the theory but you don't practise then you are not following the better methodology because you must practice a lot if you want to be the best.

In my opinion school will be much the same except they just improve a lot of new technology for education. The teacher will always need for the student for improving the activity with each student. Student still go to learn at school with the same as today. The difference as I mention before is the school in the future will need the new technology such as AI, Robot and VR to improve the way of learning. I think in the future teacher and student will need to interact in the same way as today. The conversation with each other will always help the student learn with how to be in the social. I think in the future play time is will be more than learning time because student can learn everywhere.

There are plenty of aspects to consider when deciding whether always telling the truth is something positive or negative. Among these, might be the situation we found ourselves to be, the level of trust with the other person or your own sake. To start with, it is undeniable that everybody has at least once in their live told a lie, nevertheless, besides common situations such as when a friend asks you if you like their T-shirt, not saying the truth could end up as you least expected it. For example, and most likely, when the other person finds out you have lied to them, and it only gets worse if that person is a techer, your family, or another authority. On the other hand, liying is almost always the key to lose the trust and respect of someone, as a result, being aware of the consequences of your dishonesty is an important point to consider before acting. Although it should be said as well that sometimes we do not have a choice. Last but not least, the impact that telling the truth might have on us should be mentioned too since we inevitably, now and then we need to look after ourselves and tell some lies to protect us. As long as that does not become a habit or your intentions are not two-faced. After those reasons have been exposed, in my opinion, I do think that liying or hiding things is acceptable in certain scenarios.

Firstly, the most thing I like about classmate is the possibility to improve my Enghish. I need to improve my writing because I would like to write other people in around the world. Also if I can improve my English, I will understand better the scientific papers. Secondly, the worst thing about classmate is the difficulty and the time who I need to use.

So that, I think Write and Improve is a very good tool to improve my English.

Hi billal, how are you ? Last week, I went on a trip with some students from my class. We visited the eiffel tower which is located in the city of Paris. It's very large, approximately 300 meters of heigth. When we got there, we got into an elevator that took us to the top of the tower. I was impressed with the vision from the top, I could see the whole city. I like this trip because I had never visited the eiffel tower and found it very beautiful. I would like to visit it again, but this time with you, what do you think ? Regarts, Vinicius.

To avoid hamful influence of an inflexible and lazy lifestyle on health, it is said that all university students and school children should be compulsory to do sports activities three times per week or more. From my perspective, I am back up this idea for many benefits in the long term. People could easily see many health benefits when the plan is applied in school just in two weeks. It is not the matter what sports activities they do, they will get fit in many ways. University students can play some sports which require strength like football, basketball or swimming. By that way, their stamina will be enhance and their muscle will be tighten, which might facilitate their schoolwork. School students can do lighter sports like aerobics, badminton and tennis. There are also mental sports such as playing chess, sodoku or meditation which will relieve study stress and anxiety effectively. So, doing sports activities will provide them with physical and mental strength so that they can have better peformances at school. Another benefits of being active is that students can build up their relationships and enhance their teamwork skills. When they take part in sports activities, they have a chance to make friends and cooperate other students to practise. As a result, Their relationships will be broaden which may bring to them many opportunities in the future. Moreover, in the playing sports process, students will learn how to deal with problems arosed with other people. That means their teamwork skills can improve a lot. Moreover, playing sports frequently can lessen students time on surfing the Internet and increase the time outdoors. These days, students tend to be indoor and play video games more than they were in the past, which can lead to their bad habits. But when they do sports instead of waste time on social network, they can experience many things and be closer to reality. In conclusion, doing sports activities can lead to many benefits in the future and make people's time more worthwhile. Students can gain more experience and become healthier in their lifestyles.

I have recently discovered the fail of the English exam that I took in the last exam session and after the disappointment lasted a few days, I started searching online how to deal with the problem. I was mainly focused on finding a method for improving my English writing skill without spending too much money, and in the search engine's top results I found a platform called "Write & Improve." It is a platform provided by Cambridge in recent years to provide to the user a trustworthy method for testing your English writing skill for free. The platform has several sections based on the English level or the certificate the user would like to do, and each section has thousands of examples including emails, essays, and reviews. The key feature of "Write & Improve" is the possibility to check the text whenever the user wants, multiple times, and without human interaction. This is an advantage that similar platforms do not have or are normally provided as premium features. The check of the text is done in a few seconds and gives you an insight into what can be improved and the current level of the text. The tips given by the platform don't contain many details and this could be a downside of the platform because for beginners it is important to understand well what are the mistakes and how they can be overcome efficiently. I consider "Write & Improve" a good starting point for learning English, but since It is meant for testing only one of the English skills and I recommend using additional tools during the learning.

Nowadays, it is quite common for students to live on their own while attending university, especially in prestigious universities where the selection requests come from all parts of the world. For most of the students, it is the first experience in their life where they have to look at themselves and do tasks normally done by their parents such as cooking, cleaning the room, and paying bills. The interesting idea of living on their own while attending the university is the experiences you may have with the students who live with you. It is not common for college students to live alone, however, it is more common to live in facilities such as dorms or shared houses where the student has their own room and some shared rooms where they can socialize with each other. The idea of a group or fraternity is the most attractive thing to most college students because it can lead to good memories to remember at the end of the experience. Living with our family is a good option when you would like to save money since living in such structures is really expensive. It is affordable for many people, but still not for all of them. I personally have experienced both experiences and I would recommend all the university students to move away and live on their own because, after the initial moment of difficulties, I experienced moments impossible to live at home with my family. The time passed with the other students was an important moment of growth fundamental in the life of a person.

Volunteer work is an aspect of everyday life really well appreciated by many people that can be done in many different ways. The activities normally performed in volunteer work could consist in working for some local institutions normally involved in helping people in a difficult situation or in working for the municipality, but the goal is always to involve the volunteer to work on the social side. This is mostly an extracurricular activity not recognized by schools, but some high schools started to propose volunteering as a requirement that students must meet for graduation. This proposal recalls what is normally done for some university degrees, where university students have to carry out a few hours of internship to graduate. Personally I approve the proposal of these high schools because volunteering is fundamental in this selfish and fast world dominated by the idea of thinking only of ourselves. It is an opportunity to start to understand for real the everyday problems of our city and start to understand how we can help others. Plenty of times, people live in a place for years without noticing some of the details, and sometimes even by convincing ourselves that these details aren't problems. Volunteer work, meant as the experiences in public life, should open people's eyes to bring them back to reality. These experiences are really important for personal growth and enrich and influence us for better choices in the future.

Life is the most significant thing in the world. While some creatures live a short life, some can live a long life. Most people prefer a long life. Even though most people prefer to live long, I prefer a shorter but more energetic and fascinating life. First of all, if people live a very long life without any beautiful experience, then this life is just a pain. Some prisoners, for instance, must live in a small and dark room till they die. A study shows that those prisoners would choose to live only one day with their family than live in prison until they die. They did not choose to live in prison until they die, but they choose only one day with their family. This study proves that people tend to choose a short but intense life. Secondly, when people get older, problems begin to get bigger. The Elderly cannot do the same things they used to do. That is why I prefer to live everything when I can do it. If I do not live life now, I cannot live it when I get older. To sum up, I prefer to live a shorter but much more intense life. Because I believe that the most significant thing in the world is life. If we wait to live life until we get older, we will miss various amazing and unique experiences.

When I was in the high school, I had a dream to move away and living a life alone. Of course, I didn't have any idea about how difficult would be to live away from your parents, but I had the most important: the wish to know new places and new people. Because of that, I have studied a lot and could start a college in another city called Campinas. It's a city nearby my hometown, so I thought this localization would be the best for me, because I would have the freedom I've always wanted and my parents wouldn't be so far if I had troubles and needed them fast. While I was living in Campinas, I noticed I needed to learn a lot of things to survive, such as cooking, cleaning the house on the weekends, paying the bills, etc. In the first moment, it scared me, because I haven't been prepared to this moments. But as the time passed, I could handle that and found time to enjoy my new life. I did new friendships, travelled a lot, self-accepeted my sexuality, etc. Actually, when I look back to this moment of my life and compare it with friends of mine who stayed in their hometowns to study, I see how much I've grown and how it was important to make who I'm today. Thus, if someday someone asking me with choice is the best, I'm going to say: the harder one.

As the technologies are getting more and more advanced, people nowadays live easier and sedentary lifestyles. Hence, I agree on forcing the university students and school children to do sports at least three times per week. First of all, society is educated that exercising is beneficial but we do not see the impact on the students and children. They need to be obliged to exercise in order to realise the importance of exercising regularly, which is three times a week. This is because when they start exercising, they will feel more accomplished and healthy, and finally understand the gain of exercising and being active. There is also scientific research that proves the effectiveness of forcing someone to carry out certain activities in order to realise and understand the positive consequences that will be brought. Secondly, not everyone is disciplined. Hence, by implementing this act, they will be compelled to exercise which will achieve the goal of wanting more children to be active. The neglect of the activity of the youngsters will only engender more unhealthy issues to arise. I understand that we should allow them to exercise willingly to reduce the resistance towards it, but pampering students and children by obeying their needs and wants will only impact them negatively, for example, they may have obesity if they are sedentary. So, if we truly care for them, we should take actions to hinder the unhealthy problems from arising. In my opinion, I think that we mustn't only force them to exercise. We can also reward them to keep the children motivated to continue exercising. As an example, we can give them healthy and delicious snacks to alleviate their mood from feeling blue and weary after exercising. We must treat them well as we need to respect the children at the same time. In a nutshell, I pen down writing that we must strike for a balance in implementing this act of forcing the students and children to exercise. I recommend that encouragement and obligations of exercising be done at the same time.

I started using a new learning tool to improve my written English called Write and Improve. This website in my opinion is quite useful to improve your English. It has a huge variety of topics to write about and different levels of difficult to choose, besides it has a big community of users where you can make new friends and help each other to enhance your written English. To use this website you just have to register, thereafter you can select which level of hardness you want to choose it has Beginner level, Intermediate level, the hardest one the Advanced level, furthermore it also has a Business section and a random section called Just for Fun. I also saw that you can do some test, however I can't speak about it due to the fact that I have never made one, although in the follwoing days I have decided to make some of them. The only downside that I could find was the auto-corrector, since I would rather have my text corrected by a teacher, for the reason that he can give me a feedback and help me to find the mistakes that I might have made, besides he can aid you to find solutions to these mistakes. However, in general terms I think that Write & Improve it's a wonderful tool for practice your written English and enhance it.

Unfortunately is really far from my house so me and my family will have to drive for an hour to get there, Luckily for you, the museum is extremely close to you so you will be able to arrive in no time. The museum is about World War 1 and World War 2. It shows the weaponry used in those wars and it explains in great detail about their evolution through the wars. In addition, they have maps and uniforms ,which were used by the soldiers, but the main attraction is the weaponry. I suggest you to bring some money with you because, at the museum, they a lot of souvenirs. On top of that, there are a lot of places where we can eat something and you will need some money. Also you should bring cash because it is easier to use. I am looking forward to see you at the museum. Best of luck! Sebi

Everyone in this world is good and interested at different areas. This person loves art but that person loves playing video games. Why we have that difference, because each of us is a different individual. No one can force anyone to love this or that. We have different opinions, thoughts, hobbies. So that's why we have to respect others's opinion. Back to our problem. Like I've said we are completely different individuals, no one exactly the same as another. So I think that studying music or learning about a musical instuments must depend on the students. We can't force them to do the thing we want. What do you think about studetns don't like music have to spend 2 or 3 hours of their time to do the thing that they super hate. Meanwhile they can do homework in 2 or 3 hours. If you in that position, do you agree? If schools don't have enough money to open a music class therefore we can recommend students to go to the other music class. I think we have to create a surveyor. Then we'll based on the percentage of students love music. If the students who love music more so we create a music class, if the percentage is less than the students who don't love music therefore we don't open a class. When you want to do something, don't just do it because you like it, you have to ask everyone's opinion.

We live in a historical era where the medical sector has made huge steps in the direction of keeping you alive for 100 and even more years. The lifestyle and the diet we follow in our lives are two of the main factors that influence our life and for living a long life you must do sacrifices. I am a person more into the idea of living for a shorter time but much more intense instead of living for long and calm life. In my mind, the idea I have for a long, quiet life is for something with no experience and no risk. Experiences are key moments in every person's life and are good times for personal growth and to be a better person in this selfish world. I can't imagine myself in a quiet life without the crucial experiences that have completely changed my life.

In recent years, the number of doctors has started to decline due to the limitation imposed by universities on the inclusion of new doctors in the medical field and the large number of doctors who started to retire. The few doctors who still are in service prefer to work and live in cities where they can earn a lot of money and where there are services that nowadays are considered essential. The rural areas are the most damaged in this situation because there aren't enough doctors in most of them and the medical service may disappear in future. We will in a world where most of the doctors work only for money purposes and the passion of helping people is in a few of them. Governments should work in the direction of changing and improving the rural areas to facilitate and tempt the transfer of new doctors. An additional thing, governments could do is to apply tax reductions to doctors who want to work in rural areas since most of them move to places where they can earn as much as possible. Tax reductions can also include reimbursement of certain expenses such as gasoline or public transport passes if doctors live far from the clinic.

In the past, sports activities were the only way to have fun for most university students and school children. The recent improvement in technology has introduced a new way to have fun beyond sports, but at the same time, the number of people who started to be inactive has increased. Recent studies have also highlighted that the correlation between technologies and inactive lifestyles is more present in younger people than in other age groups. Governments started to manage the critical situation and have proposed forcing college students and school children to do sports activities at least three times a week. For many schools and universities, the proposal is affordable and can be applied with minimal effort as the necessary facilities already exist and management does not require much effort. The government's proposal is interesting and I consider it as the best way to contrast the bad habits and lifestyles of many students. At the same time, I disagree with the number of times they should do such activities. It is important to let students develop their hobbies and interest by allowing them enough spare time, and the proposal doesn't consider this idea. By doing sports activities at least three times per week would force students to spend too much time at school without allowing students thinking more about themselves and their real interests. The students' engagements and interests should be more respected, and I have always thought that the imposition of the rules with the force only produces the opposite result. I would suggest governments rethink their proposal and start being more realistic. The corrections I would do, take into account the reduction in the number of times students should perform their sporting activities and the voluntary basis for carrying out the activities. I know that forcing people to do sports is the only way to stimulate them to counter their bad habits, but less active activities are also important and sport should be more of an addition to our life and not a real obsession.

When talk to mobile phones, it is a very common thing for the modern people. Because of the phone we can enjoy vary kinds of convenient technology. But there are some negative effect show up in the same time. For example,people walk on the street and use their phone. This is very dangerous thing not only for himself or herself but also the driver next to him or her. Because when the walker pay their attention to the phone, they may not see the car go through and easy to be crashed. Therefore I think the government can build a policy to restrict using phone when they on the road. It can be a punishment of money or a safe class to instruct they about the security. But there are some convenient thing that it needs to use the phone on the road, like take a phone call, send a message, or even book a restuarant for a sweet date when you forget to book it before you went out. It is very important that the goal of the policy isn't use to ban every thing about the mobile phone but just prevent public people from the dangerous accident happened on the raod. To sum up, I support the government to restrict the mobile phone by building the policy which won't cause inconvenience for us.

Summer time is a great time to relax by myself by soaking up the sun at a beach or simply having dinner. A summer season is the best time for festivals and activities. I can never get bored on a summer day and night. During the day, there are a lot of fun activities such as: swimming, sports, picnics and barbeques.

There are 2 kinds of people in the world, those who like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old, and those who prefer a shorter life but much more intense. The choice is hard, but after a long period of thought, I found myself preferring to have a short but intense life. The first reason is that I can make a contribuation to society and the world in a short but intensive life. If I have a long, calm life, that means that I will only be an onlooker in the big events of the world, never to be someone that participated in them. On the hand, if I live a short but much more intensive life, I can have the chance to participate in events that changed the world, like discovering a cancer vaccine, inventing something that changed the world, or saving the world from destruction by foiling a villian's evil scheme. This is a major reason why I prefer a short, intense life. Second of all, I can have the satisfaction of having the knowledge that I helped and made a contribuation to the world. If I live a long, calm life, I will die regretting not making a contribuation to society. However, if I live a short life that is way more intense, I will die with the knowledge that I have made a useful contribuation to the world in my life. This is also a major reason I prefer a short, intensive life. All in all, I would prefer to live a short, intense life over a long, calm life because I can make a contribuation to the world and die with the satisfaction of knowning so.

we are living in times of social distace. People are worried about their health and the health of their family too. Instead of this we all have to work, some companies have their offices where people share an environment. Some companies have s at the office. Making small offices inside the room. The worker has his personal space to work. In my opinion, not only because we are in the meadle of a pandemic but also as a worker, I think a worker is more efficiently when he works alone, the worker concetrat only in his job, without a person to distract him he can focus on his tasks and how to complete them efficiently. This kind of office is perfect to introvert people because they do not like to socialize while they are working. As I read in a famous book "every men have to have his own space, where he can discover himself." In my personal experience. I work in a quietly place. where I am able to work being one-hundred porcent focused at my work.

It is known by everyone that sleep is an important part of our lives and it should be offered the credit it deserves. Some people like to sleep in a dark and quiet room. However other people like having a source of light in their room. So which is my preferred way of sleeping. Firstly I personally prefer to live in a noisy environment but I cannot fall asleep with a lot of noise in my room, so I like a quiet rooom. Secondly falling asleep with a source of light in my room seems impossible for me. When I was younger I used to sleep with some light despite the fact that I had issues falling asleep with it but nowadays I sleep in a dark room. In conclusion, with everything said above, I personally prefer to sleep in a quiet and dark environment, but this is only my preference .

Hi Billal. How is it going? Miss you! I want to tell you about my trip. Well, with my classmates we went to the city called San Francisco, it is a good place to travel because everything is cheap and the food is delicious. In the morning we went to the city center and visited different places: the museum, the church, the school and the park. The park is very beautiful because it is very large and people can enjoy the beautiful landscapes. For the rest of the day we went to the restaurant and ate a lot of food. At night we returned to the hotel and the next day we would return from home. I enjoyed that trip too much and hope that one day we can take a trip in San Francisco. Take care, Billal. Bye

One survey from a famous magazine. Showed that a man he tells more than twenty one lies per day. Some people think that lies are normal in our society, others think that lies should be avoided.

It meas that the truth is hard but set you free. There are fake news, lies that people say on social media, this lies can be harmful to some people. I think that some lies may be acceptable. We tell some lies for convenience, to looks like attractive to a girl you like, during a job intervieew, the most common lie is when a person do not want to be punished for a mistake. I sometimes tell some lies too. Sometimes I receive invitations and I do not want to attend then I say I am busy at the moment but what I am not busy. when you are in love you will always lie to impress the other person. It happened to me when I met my wife, I lied a little things to impress her. But as my mother always said lies do not last long and she knows me very well now. I think people can lie but their lies should not cause problems to other people.

As a people we have different behivour and attuide so when you are going to talk about the truth In my opinion the truth always is hard but we need to believe that the truth is best . In addition there are lots of situations that you need to be honest and accept your desnity like when you finish the high school and you want to decide What are you want to do? Do you want to study at University or you want to work? The is decision it needs to think carefully and after you decide you have to tell your parents your decision so you need to be honest with your family about your desire also you need to show them that your are responsible better your life. Sometimes you need to lie for some reason for example if you want to visit your friend and your mother she is accepted that so your friend tells you I miss you shall we meet on Sunday please for one hour in that you need to lie to your mother that you want to study for your exam so you need to go for the library and it is actually you want to meet your friend.

Many people when they have problems in there work or even personal problems they lie to other people to avoid another but the thing lying to people it is could create other problem such as losing money or having problems in your life. As a result of that telling lies to people can get you lose important relationship or losing a marriage and the problem could get worset if your lies affect other people and it might get them lose there life or sometime' even end up going to Jall.

Summer is full of lively animals, plants, the flower bloom everywhere. And, especially the summer vacation is the most exciting part, because of all those things I love the summer. There are only black and white in Winter and the sky has a boring grey color, everything is boring. In Spring, the weather is relaxing but we have to go back to school, and the school is boring too. Autumn is too wet, the weather is always rainy. And Summer is a perfect season for the most exciting activities. We can go camping on the National Park, or have a long vacation to another country. Last year, I have been to Vietnam, a beautiful country with friendly people; I and family went to many lovely place.

It is generally known that health is what a person needs the most in the world to strive for great wealth and the future. Firstly, I would like to emphasize the idea that money cannot buy health despite of having the ability of acquireing the best medical system, however, money is earned through good health. If our health is affected by a grave disease like cancer or HIV, money could only provide the best treatments and doctors but it could never give us back our healthy body. Secondly, I would like to point out that health brings us the opportunity to enjoy our life. For example, when we are healthy we can do all the things we like such as going on holidays, doing some sports, gathering with family and friends, eating our favourite food and so on. But if we fall ill, we are restricted to do many of those activities in order to have a good recovery. Judging by the above mentioned, I can say that being healthy is the foundation we need to obtain everything in life and enjoy it, this includes having money. So health is much more important than wealth.

In the corporate world there are a lot of people working inside offices. From secretaries responsible for making and answering calls to exuctives deciding the future of a company. Companies have different office arrangements, some of them have open spaces while others keep their employees working inside cubicles. But, what is the best alternative when talking about office arrangements? An open working space provides more interaction between workers as everyone is seeng each other all the time, so communication flows easily, indeed the lack of physical barriers make the subordinates feel free to talk to their bosses because these physical obstacles can also work as psychological boundaries between workers of different levels. The cubicles also have their roles inside a company as there are some activities that requires deep concentration, so any noise can affect the effectiveness of who is doing the job. Big companies also deal with projects with a high level of secrecy in which any leak of information can be dangerous to their strategy. As mentioned before I don't believe there is an exclusive option, but the one suited best for the type of work that is being done. The thing is, when designing an office a company needs to know what kind of work will be done there to make the best choice. I also believe offices can have the two arrangements combined using alternative ways to reduce the existing boundaries while also keeping the needed secrecy of some jobs.

In this day and age sitting lifestyle becomes more common among young people as they study a lot and huge part of their social life happens online. As a result kids and teenagers are less active, but it does not mean that they should be forced to do sports activities, at most, they ought to be encouraged to do so. Forcing someone to do sports from such a young age creates unhealthy mindsets towards physical activity which is then seen rather as a chore than a way to stay healthy. On account of this, people obligated to be active will have hard time finding sport enjoyable in the future, which can quickly cause them to fall of the wagon, resulting in an increase in obesity and other health problems connected with lack of movement. What is more, obligatory physical activity in schools and universities usually comes in a form of PE classes, where there are not many alternatives when it comes to things children and teenagers can do. Limiting kids' options to football, basketball, volleyball and other easy to organize games does not help them reach their full potential and discover their talents. It can also trouble kids who are not gifted when it comes to playing those accessible sports. Despite everything that has been mentioned, forcing young people to do sports three times a weak ensures that they keep their bodies healthy during demanding years of their development. In consequence, many diseases, characteristic for those of young age can be easily prevented. All things considered, forcing healthy lifestyle on kids has far more downsides than advantages and it should not be done by school’s authorities. All humans, despite their age, have the right to decide how they want to live their life. Children and young adults ought to be able to choose healthy lifestyle, ideally following example that their parents have gave them.

In my opinion, there is no point in living a long, calm life until 100 years, so I would rather live a shorter but much more exceptional one. Let us start this with a question, what would life be without a drop of adrenaline? Let me answer, it would be tedious. A life like the first one mentioned would be a basic one, in which someone already knows what is going to happen. That person would finish his studies, then will get a job, a family and will live on his beach house, where no one could bother him, until the death will come. On the other hand, imagine having such an amazing life, in which everything is mysterious and everything could happen. Personally, I would try the best experiences, for example, swimming with sharks or anything like this that is insane. In such a life, there is no space for boredom. You could travel the whole world and try the best things that are possible only in some places. It doesn't matter that you won't live that long. At the end of the day, it is much more important what you have done rather than how long you have lived. As one of my good friends would say, everyone should think that after our deaths, we will remain just a memory in others mind, so let us try to be a great memory. To sum up, I would prefer to live a much shorter life but more intense rather than a long and calm one.

I think that a lot of thing are going to change about travel in the future for example people are going to travel more quickly or people are going to have in another place virtually. Why do I think people will be in another place virtually? I think that because there is arlready an application which to do that. If you don't realize you can research about google map which is an application where you can visit other place around the world and you can know about it. I know it is not the same experience as being personally but it is an option that many people can have when they have not enough money to travel. Today many people are doing a lot of video about other countries where they receive money in youtube for theirs videos and I think that it is a good option to be able to pay a travel. Things will not change are the way as people must interact with other person in another place around the world, I think that English will be the universal language to communicate with another. I think in the future the option to travel can be more easy because you are going to have more option to choose which travel is more comfortable for you.

Both of choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. My rule of making a decision between two things is listed the benefits and drawbacks. See which one has the most advantages so I'll choose it First, I will talk about the benefits of moving away and living their own lives while they are university students. The period of ages being a college students are between 15-18. At that time, their brains have developed and is aware of what is right and wrong, knowing what to do and not to. In that moment, they're mature enough to replace their parents. If they still live with them, their lovely dads, mom will be their sources of corruption. Secondly, I'll talk about the advantages of students who live with their family. If they move away ftomtheir family so early therefore they don't have many experiences to the current of life where exists the intense contention. They will be safer if they live with their parents. Their mothers, fathers who gained lots of experiences, overcome many rivalries. They will share to the students and guide them to the right paths. Thirdly, the disaventages of living without family. I bet that, you will feel lonely, unhappy because you got used to live with them. After that, you don't know where to start, you begin to be lost. Everything happens so suddenly that you can't handle it. It'll be better if you already got your plan and carefully solve all kinds of problem through asking your parents's experiences. Fourthly, the drawbacks of living with moms and dads. Parents always want their kids to be safe and do everything for them just because they don't want to see their darlings tired. But they don't know that's cost the corruption of the children. They'll be lazy and arrogant. One day, this society will teach them with insults, fired. Eventually, my choice is to move away form your family and set up your own life. It will be very hard also difficult at first but then after each failures, I can learn different lessons, so the next time I won't be like that anymore. The feeling of moving far away from your lovely members are full of sadness, lonely. But you must over come it. They can't live with you until the end of your lives. You'll have this feeling soon, so why not now, therefore when it truly occurs that's terrible and you can over come it easily. When your parents are young, they are the same as you so why they could do it and you can't?

As far as I'm concerned that somebody tell a lie is really terrible. There are many reasons that it can bring this answer to me. Firstly, the person who often tells a lie will lead to that his or her friends hardly believe him or her. For a classic example, it is a fable bewteen the boy taking care for the sheep and the wolf. The naughty boy thinks that it is very funny to say there is a wolf comes to eat the sheep. Because of that, all the residents living in the village will walk out to protect the sheep from the attack of wolf. After the boy pranked the residents for many times, residents heard the boy calling for help again but all of them considered it as a joke and nobody went out to give him a hand. In the end, the sheep was attacked and the residents were very angry. So the trust between people will be exhausted by the lies. Second, when a person tell a lie, the person usually must to tell others more lies to let the first one reasonable. For instance, my friend ,David, hangs out with me but him didn't get his mom's assent. He also had a clam school needed to go on the same time. Therefore he took a phone call to clam school and took a day off. Unfortunately, the clam school called for his Mom and his mom known that too. Then him receive the phone call from his Mom, so he made more lies convince his Mom. But the truth will emerge in some day. And he got a quite scolding. To sum up, being honest will be the best way to live in the world.

In the room like this, I can sleep quickly than a room with small light. Secondly, I think if I sleep with some noise, I will be used to it. And if I set an alarm, maybe I can't hear it since I always sleep with the noise. However, when I sleep in a quiet room, not only can I sleep soundly, but also I can wake up in the first ring of alarm clock.

It's really hard for me to make a decision between 2 things, to my consideration are both effective. But, maybe they're not. Let's analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each one. The advantage of work in enclosed workstations is you can have your own workspace. You'd feel more comfortable if you work alone. Let's imagine that you're thinking of a problem and how to solve it, but then when you look up and you see a bunch of people in front of you, maybe they don't do anything but that could cause your thoughts are interrupted. So if you're a boss, why don't you separate walls therefore your employees would a 100% focusing on their works But, everything on this world will have 2 sides, including this. The disavantage of working with walls sperating are some people, they don't like this. They got used to work as a team. The most preventable is separating walls. They want during they're working, they can easily talk with their colleagues. We can't force them to like what we like, because each person has different opinions. The benefit of working without walls separating is like the drawback of work in cubicles. That will apply successfully if people in the offices are extroverted. Depend on the purposes offices want to achieve, so we have different solution. The reason why I didn't talk about the drawbacks of working without walls separting because that's the advantages of working in cubicles. To me, I have my own decision. I know that somebody will disagree with me because we're not the same. I'd prefer working in enclosed workstaions. I don't know what type of humanity am I , extroverted or introverted. But I don't care. The thing I assure that my thoughts will be not interrupted if I choose to work in cubicles.

It is often said that having a peaceful, long-lasting life and gaining lots of achievements are the things that many people desire to. But we all know that it is not easy to get both of them or balance our lives in that way, so we have to strap something. From my perspective, I would like to live a long, tranquil life rather than a shorter, prosperistic one. That does not deny the fact that no one is successful without trying hard and the reason behind that effort mostly is money which has highly power for paying all the bills and securing a bright future for anyone. But all lives will end someday and people could not be buried with their money. And the older people are, the fewer expectations they have. Their final purpose is happiness and calm with their beloved one. So why we don't enjoy this while we are alive? Many people did not spend much time with their family members, close friends or their partners when they pursuited their wildest dreams, which is the thing that they most regretted then whatever their dreams came true or not. We only live once and we rarely live as it should be. So, learning to be pleasant with everything we have and enjoy each minute passed by is the key to a happy life, not rushing in unreachable thing. Moreover, if you live a long and peaceful life, there is a lot of interesting things ahead for you to go through. But if you live a short and intense life, you are likely to miss many things. On the other hand, living a calm life doesn't mean that you can have a decent life without doing anything. You still have to work to make enough budget to meet your family demand. In conclusion, you don't need to become a billionaire to be happy. Keeping in touch with your loved one, close to the nature, doing what you love is perfect preparation for your life

telling the truth is a favourable thing in the value and moral system of all communities around the world. In addition, telling the truth is an important element in all religious scriptures in which people believe in. Telling the truth is the centre on which all other human values are based on. We teach our children to always say the truth no matter what it takes, because the opposite; which is telling lies has very damaging conseqeunces. Telling the truth can sometimes save lives of others as well as achieves justice for people who are oppressed in the crinimal justice. Nevertheless, telling the truth is always a good thing because it enables us to respect others' rights and maintain their dignity. In medical ethics, clinicians must always say the truth no matter what consequences that might arise from it. For example, if a surgeon makes medical mistake while performing the surgery, he or she, must disclose the truth of what happned during the surgery with complete honesty even if it will pose them worse consequences. Similarly, telling the truth is part of every other career environments. People often find themselves in situations in which they have to tell a small good lie to make a friend happy. I think such small good lie may be acceptable as long as it does not hurt anyone or affects anyone's dignity and wellbeing. In conclusion, I would say telling the truth is a sacred value for almost all communities around the world, and I very much value it!

Sleeping is very important for everyone because it helps to get fresh mind when we wake up. But there are different types of sleeping styles. For example, some people like to sleep in a dark and quiet room but others love to sleep with a small light on. For me, I like sleeping in a dark and quiet room because it makes me not only to sleep soundly but also to get enough sleep too. With the noises and with a small light on, it makes me not to sleep and I can't get well asleep. Therefore, I like to sleep in a dark and quiet room.

In my opinion, there are several questions about imposing volunteer activities as a duty on high school students. First of all, volunteer work is something that people do with their awareness. For this reason, I am against making it compulsory. Second, there are any opportunities for students not to learn why some people need the volunteerwork. Students may simply think of this activity as an obligation. In other words, this program takes away their ability to think about the meaning of their action. If school's curriculum wants students to become aware of their environment and people in the community who need their help, it should not only impose the activity itself but also provide an opportunity to study the importance of the activity. As these reasons, I think that the high school should not handle volunteerwork like as credit. I think that teachers should give an opportunity to learn and work with them together in the field.

After graduating high school, students usually apply for university. Some of them decide to stay in their childhood houses, others move out to start on their own, alone. Which option is the better one? Firstly, students who choose to stay with their parents are faced with less resposibilities. This can be really helpful, considering amount of time one spends studying. Usually, parents pay for a living. The student does not have to work, therefore have more time to study. What is more, parents usually guarantee healthy food to eat. They cook, bake and make foods with healthy calories, which improves one's overall well being and condition. This way, the student's nourished brain works better and the student ends up with better grades. On the other hand, one's abilities to manage money or to learn responsibility drastically go down. That is because constantly living in comfort only leads to discomfort in the future life. Young people benefit from moving by learning a lot of practical skills which are later needed in adulthood. Student who move after graduating become independent much faster. To sum up, opinions diverge. I personally believe people should learn independence as fast as they can - it will make their future life easier.

There are many programs that are broadcast on television they can be educate program or they can be programs that are not available for children but it will depend on what we as parent decides for our children to watch. I believe that the responsibilities is ours as parents and we need to have conntrol over what our children are seeing. We cann't prevent a television program from broadcasting a specific program but we can control what our children can see. I think it is something of education and education begins at home with all the examples we set for our children. Many times we can blame other people for everything bad that our children are doing, but the main responsibility is our as parents and we must show them the right way. If we show them the good things that television give us, I think that we will have not a problem with that because we should show them that television can show us documentaries or various things that we need to learn and not everything is bad. The television is something that change our life and the way that we have fun right now.

In my opinion, it is more comfortable for office workers to spend their time into enclosed space. First of all, because in an enclosed space, it is easier to consent on their desk work. Companies need to achieve their missions and earn money in order to pay their employer. For this reason, it is necessary for companies to provide their staff with comfortable work place. Some people think it is not good to communicate with other members if employer stay in their compartment desk. But I can override this point, because there are many opportunities to share idea by using mail or business meeting. Staff can communicate by using these tools or they can plan meeting. I think that is more effective for people who does not have enough time. Sometimes some people spend invalid time with chatting other members in open space. Moreover they can consider their ideas and present them to prepare staff meeting beforehand. All of these reasons I think it is more effective to provide enclosed space with employers.

I will point out my view regard the question whether I prefer working in cubicles or in an office with a more open design. At the beginning, every employee needs to be able carrying out his work. Thus, the colleagues must behave appropriately in order to create a conforme atmosphere. If this is the case, I do not see difficulties in offices whose design is more open, but rather advantages. Referring to this the team spirit of the employees could strengthen and they could stand by their colleagues to compensate their individual weaknesses. Additionally, the atmosphere would be more communicatively and the personnel would feel more convivially. In contrast to this, the circumstances are in cubicles sometimes better, because office work matters a bulk of movement and much conversation about various issues. This can be irritating for an outstanding person, who focuses on another task and hardly concentraces. By taking all this into consideration, I safely assume that this question can only be answered induvidually as it depends on the colleagues you have on work.

We are living in a society in which the number one cause of death are cardiovascular related diseases which are in terms mainly influenced by factors like activity and nutrition. This poses rightfully so the question whether the national government should consider a mandatory sport membership in a sports club? Starting of with the legitimacy. Of course such a policy is considered to be a huge intervention in both parental autonomy and the freedom of the concerning child. However one can argue that in health related issues such interventions can be justified as it is already the case in other health care issues and preemptive medical examinations. Another often overlooked challenge is that new policies can result in social injustice and discrimination. Applying this to our case one notices a need for at least partial public funding of the activities or sports clubs in order to legitimate it. Also a social stigmatisation of untalented may arise. Looking at efficiency we have to ask us how well would such a policy induce the desired result without costing too much. Looking at costs might be quite simple if the policy shows any effect, expressed in lowering hospitalization rates at all, the net savement of health insurance costs already finance the regulation. However one has also pay attention to any beaurocratic challenges entailed by the supervision of such a regulation. Another argument against this case is that most cardiovascular related diseases only arise at a certain age and school children are virtually unaffected. The only thinkable benefit would be the building of healthy habits at a young age and the establishment of more prominent role of sports in our society in general. As you can see a similar regulation entails many potential consequences. And one important question remains unanswered, is the intervention in our children's freedom worth the possibly small benefits?

Dear town council. Although we all know about the downsides that the use of a mobile phones in public places or even in shops and restaurants can cause, such as distraction and accidents. The use of theses objects in my opinion should not be prohibeded. In spite of the facts related above, there are many advantages to using mobile phones, let´s take the use in public transport as example, we can take a long journey in a transport, and with the help of a mobile, we can work on things during this path. Observing now one example in a restaurant, imagine that you are a very occupied person, as I can imagine you guys from town concil must be, if you haven´t have the help of these mobiles phones, how many dinners and lunches you would have to cancel to attend to an appointment? These technologies are here to help us to live better and more efficient, so there is no doubt in my opinion that mobile phones should keep allowed in theses places . Even more, we can see in our rights about to be free to do whenever we want, since don´t do bad or disturb other people. To summarise, I believe this thinking of yours are completely equivocated, and should be revised before you turn it in public.

If you want to be healthy thare are many ways to achieve such as exercise, eat health food or follow influencer on social media who can teach you to be healthy.

If I can choose one of these I will choose to be health because if we be health it because I am rich.

The teacher is a critical factor in the process of education; if we had a bad teacher we may be hurt by him, and if we had a good teacher he will help us, but if we had a great teacher then we will be inspired by him. The question of what do you prefer a teacher for several years or having a teacher every year is complicated; we can't just answer yes or not, it is not that simple. My opinion is that it depends on two things, first and foremost, is he inspiring and compatible with the students? If yes, we can move to the second question, is he able to teach one class for several years? If the answer to the questions is yes too, then I think he can teach the class for several yeas. But to be honest; I believe that having one teacher every year is the best choice, why? Because I had many great teachers over the years, if one of them taught me for several years then I would not be able to know the others, which would be a disaster, because I had learned something from each and every one of them, their words still in my mind, I can still hear them. To summarize, no, I do not think that having one teacher for several years is a good idea.

As one of the users of Write and Improve, I would recommend this learning tool to everyone who wants to study English writing. It is a useful and helpful tool, especially for those who are learning English on their own and are trying to check whether their writing is correct or not. When learning another language, it can be difficult to determine your own answers. For example, it's easy to learn reading and listening by solving a set of questions and checking the answers. Writing and speaking, on the other hand, have multiple correct answers due to the richness of expressions. The best way to check your writing and speaking expressions is to take lessons from a native English speaker, but it is costly. With Write and Improve, students can learn English in a more convenient and economical way. Write and Improve has the ability to determine the accuracy of sentences, but it can be difficult to understand why a sentence is incorrect. Sometimes students don't know enough to correct the sentences and need help figuring out why they are wrong. Therefore, I think this is one of the weaknesses in using Write and Improve. However, this great tool can help English learners who want to improve their writing skills.

I think it is better for college students to live with their families during their college years if they can commute to college from home. Firstly, it is more economical to stay at home and students can concentrate on their studies. Many students go to college to study, but some students are more into part-time jobs. It's hard to find time to study your major while working part-time. If you stay at home, your family will be there to support you. Secondly, living alone can be hazardous to one's health. Many students tend to eat irregularly and sleep poorly without the constraints of their families. To avoid this situation, it is a good choice to spend as much time as possible with your family. After finishing school, it will be more difficult to stay with your family. Probably all of you will start working, and some of you will have to go to your hometown by order of your company. Therefore, you will have to move and live on your own, whether you want to or not. For these reasons, I think it is better for me to stay with my family.

It is because English is a language that use all around the world and if you need to going abroad or go study in another English is useful and must learn if you don't you can't live in another. But in my truly feeling English is as not as important as I always think. In recently months I usually think that is why do I need to learn another for living in another country why not someone made equipment that can translate one language to another language. Many people say it hard to do such thing but I think human can do such thing. We need to abolish money that prevent the useful equipment to happen.

They have both benefits and drawbacks. First, let's look at the benefits. To begin with, students who live alone have a better grasp of their skills and self-control. They will recognize the difference between staying at home and starting to act on their own. They will also aid in the development of the student's self-esteem, allowing them to realize what is best for them as they mature into adults. It will also liberate them from the gaze of their parents, allowing them to experience freedom for the first time. The benefits of living at home with your parents at school are that you'll be able to communicate with them quickly and resolve any unpleasant issues that might arise. In a good relationship, students will feel safe with their parents. They will strive to help their parents by doing the duties. In my opinion, the university is a time when students must develop their understanding of the world and their place within it. They require their own space. However, students must have high self-esteem and never keep anything important from their parents to compensate for the disadvantages.

There have been an argue about video games, some people think that it is helpful and fun, while others think it is harmful and may cause addiction. The truth is actually mix of these two opinions. If we considered the first ponit of view we see that it is true. Because according to recent studies surgeons who play video are more likely to be skillful than surgeons who do not play video games. The other thing is that it can be a way to soclise, especially when played as teams. But let's take into account the opposite opinion. Video games especially the ones that include violence that has a negative effects on its players brains; and it reaches its maximum harmful effect when played by children. The second bad influence video games may have is addiction. Addiction to video games is called behavioural addiction, it is similar to addiction to lottery or masturbating, which makes the video games a real danger especially for the children and young boys. My personal opinion is that video games is fun, but we should take care of what we let our kids play on it, and how much time they spend playing; because kids do not know what is harmful or what is not, and that is our reponsibility.

Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. In my opinion, this idea is absolutely reasonable. No one can deny that sports activities can undoubtedly do good to our health. Regular exercise can boost immunity. Regular physical exercise is not only good for physical fitness but also good for mental health. Research has found that students who exercise regularly are more positive and optimistic than who don't. To all school children, doing sports frequently can help us improve concentration, which can help students gain better grades. What's more do sports activities can improve students' team work. It can also enhance the relationship between students. So it is of vital importance for students to do sports activities. But there are different voices about whether exercise takes up time for study and leads to a decline in academic performance. From my perspective, it is reasonable to do sports at least three times a week. Doing sports activities three times per week is understandable. It can definitely help students resist the inactive lifestyle and form healthier life habits. Although not every student is interested in work out, they still should get regular exercise and get used to it. Take myself for example, I was a people who hate doing sports. Also, I am extremely fond of eating junk food, which led to my terrible health condition and bad grades. But everything changed when I started exercise. I work out more frequently than three times a week. Consequently, My study and my physical health both improved. Above all, it has been proved that doing sports activities three times a week is of great benefit to students. And it is Students' duty to take care of their own body and resist inactive lifestyle.

Telling the truth is important, and you are told to tell the truth all the time. But sometimes we will have to lie for something good or cover up something good for us. We call these lies "white lies." Telling a lie may hurt other people's feelings. That's what we know for sure. But is telling a lie that bad? We sometimes tell a lie before we even notice it. Telling a white lie is useful for not hurting people's feelings. Like your friend is getting married and is choosing a wedding dress. She loves it, but you hate it. Do you tell her that this dress is awful and choose one that she doesn't like, or tell her "You look great! But on this one, it might be better." Things aren't the say we think they are. They are also used for comforting people. Telling your mother that her meatloaf is delicious when you hate the meatloaf. Telling your friend that she doesn't look fat in her dress when she asks because you don't want to tell her that she's gained a lot of weight and looks heavy. There are no rules of the game although Gould suggests that if a white lie requires additional white lies or hinders the expression of your personal needs then you should tell the truth. She suggests delivering honesty “with a side of gentleness.” It’s best, to be honest, to avoid having to lie again and again.

The nature is fascinating; that's why humans always try to get close to it. The problem is that humans use a twisted ways in order to achieve this purpose; zoos is one example to these ways. A lot of arguments have happened about zoos, and whether it is a right or wrong. Let's take into account the first opinion. They assume that having zoos is a good thing, because people learn about animals; they get close to these creatures and interact with them; plus, they aruge that as long as the cages are clean and the animals eat properly then there isn't any reason to think it's wrong. The opposite point of view is opposed to the idea of putting the animals in cages. They say that is more suitable to keep them free in their natural habitat; and that keeping them locked is crucial even if we provided the right food and services for them. Both of these two opinions are valid, personally, I tend to lean into the wrong side. I do think that keeping the animals in cages is wrong. when humans are being put in cages it is wrong; so it should be the same case for animals. Animals have feelings too.

In my opinion, it is important for students to learn about music and how to play musical instrumental. There are two reasons. First of all, music classes support students in undestanding not only the music but also the social context of why the music was created and loved. For example, court music in Europa has a lot of traditional manners and unique history. In these times, playing music was sometimes a way of gaining high status. Music is not just for fun, but it is a tool to obtain something or express one's feeling. In other words, to learn about music is to learn about our history. This enriches our knowledge. Second it is difficult for us to study music by our own. Today, we can easily listen to variety of mucics, but we rarely have the opportunity to understand them properly. Moreover it is high cost to play musical instrumental if we take a private lesson. Therefore, learning music is valuable and economical opportunity for students. This is my idea for this topic.

Studying abroad is a beneficial opporutnity to any student, and it is an experience that should be had at least once in a lifetime. And like any experience in the world it has advantages and disadvantages too; the most important advantage will be seeing other cultures, and interact with it; this interaction might be helpful, especially for people who are coming from poor countries, because it helps them see another world and other people; which may be a motivation for him to help his country more. The other advantage will be the travel itself. Travelling makes us see other people, other cultures and other heritage. It is always great to see yourself than hearing about anyone. But there are always disadvantages too, first of all it may hard for some students to travel and be in another country with other people, this change in the environment may cause a negative effect on some students, especially the introverts.

Today's world, there are plenty of schools which require students to take various classes. Some of them focus on improving their students' knowledge and abilities at science, others based their syllabus on art. I completely oppose that schools require younger to learn music. I have two reasons to think so that; first, students should have free will and second, music may not be a cup of tea for some of them. First and foremost, any of education center can require students to study music since this step is absolutely contrary to students' right of choosing freely. They should opt for their classes for their own without any interference. Let's suppose that school authorities have an opportunity to select students'classes instead of their own selves. In this regard, how can we expect that these students will be free adults in the future? Next, according to statistics and basen on past experiences, I can unhesitantly state that some students are really god at music,; however, other not. As an inborn instinct, a human can not adept at everything, he or she have some special abilities, interest on different areas. Seldom do we run into some super students, whose IQ are most probably astronomical and they can do everything wonderful. However, set aside this kind of heroes, most of our young children can do something good or bad. In a nutshell, authorities at schools do not have a right to make music lesson compulsory for students . Students should take heir own decision freely.

Our forceful and rhythmic emotions are expressed through music. It's the sound of our hushed voices. Music is similar to food, air, and other necessities. Without music, we wouldn't be able to create anything. Sometimes music makes us feel better, occasionally it makes us feel emotional, and sometimes it makes us act erratically. Life would be emotional, monotonous, and everyone would look alike. Everything looks the same, and every word sounds the same. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Nobody expected it to be rhythmic. Everything would be done on a regular basis. And it's the most uninteresting aspect of the situation. Everything would be the same: we'd be emotional, our conversations would be emotionless, and everything would be the same. People gradually discover sounds. After that, they learn to combine sounds to create music. Finally, music will be in our lives again. Eventually, we got music. Everything will be like now. Rhythmic sounds are always in our life.

The population of the entire planet increase rapidly and the people who leaves in the many rural areas become more and more affected. The residents of the cities are more interested in changing their standard of living and this situation became a crucial problem for the medical system. Most of all medical doctors think at a successful career and want to touch their goal with people living in a good environment. So they decided to leave their birthplaces for urban places. In every country there are two kinds of human settlements: the cities and the villages. While the opportunity that a city offers rise quickly, the variety of educational and technological things that a village could give you decrease dramatically. Therefore one of the most determinative shift in the life of a man who wants a great career would be to leave his old village from a new town. I believe that the medicine give us a chance of victory for our body and mental health. A medical doctor means more than a simple human. The doctors help the entire world with their passion and hopeness and that could be a reason why they long for more opportunities in their doctors' careers. In fact, this situation could be a big problem for the people who choose to spend their life in a village because every man needs the best medical system and it could be realised with the most prepared and smart doctors. So this point would be solved with similar salaries and a digitized and high-performance medical system. Every country should create a favorable environment for every occupation.

Today music is omnipresent. Never was it easier before to tune in your favourite song whether you are working, playing in the background while dining or during our daily commute. However this begs the question whether one can listen to too much music? We all know the first signs of hearing a song too often, the inner playback in our head. The more serious symptoms can be significant effects on our daily lifes in forms of productivity loss or demotivation. To answer the question of too much we may first reckon the query of function. For some the main intend is getting into mood or emphasizing current emotions. Others see in music an efficient memory assistance, reliving the old past. However these functions seem to lose efficiency and effect if one listens to the same song too often. Instead of being associated with that one specific memory it becomes the song playing in the background at all times. That is why I advocate a more active and remebering listening to music and songs, which get passively picked up in our daily lifes for example in the gym, radio or at a party.

Music is simply the bridge between natural world and spiritual world and that's the reason it is written in the Bible that: God inhabits the praises. Music is one of the ways we get connected to God, that's why we feel so good listening good songs. Yes, it seems strange or even pretencious but, there is a clear difference between good and bad and we all can see this. That's the reason Homer used an illustration to say that some mermaids were singing to lust Ulysses and his partners to that island aiming to hold them there and the message behind this part of the tale is really important because it is telling us that the goal behind a song is its qualifier. That said, music is really important in thousands of ways and sometimes we remember good or bad things, because of a song which brings us positive or negative remembrances. In conclusion: without music, life would be a mistake and this is maybe the only thing I agree with Nietzsche.

Nowadays, more and more rural areas are beginning to experience an incredible disagreeable issue: the lack of medical doctors. This void is due to the fact that many doctors are convinced that the salaries working in remote rurale areas are too low and not enough satisfying. Thus, the most of them prefer to begin their career in large cities, where they have got the possibility of earning more. This choice is understandable. The process of becoming a doctor is anything but easy: you have to study and commit hard for a long time. Hence, it would not be fair for a doctor to receive a low income. Were I to be a doctor, I would not accept myself less than a $5000 salary. Therefore, the unique solution is the following: raising the wages of doctors in rural areas, toom, taking them to the same level of those of doctors who work in cities. Moreover, doctors who choose a rural area as their definitive workplace should get some extra money for that, because the choice of living in a village to help people renouncing to all the comforts of the city is a rewardable. This was just my humble suggestion in order to solve a problem which is spreading fairly fast and which has to be urgently overcome

Music has always played an important role in our life since forebears times. It has often inspired men and women making them brave and able to face many different situations. For instance, armies in the past used music to encourage them against enemies during the war and it has been an inspiration for the biggest leaders around the world. It is also very important when people need to relax and go out from the normal life. There are a lot of melodies that are able to make us feel in different ways like sad, happy and scared. In my opinion living a life without music would be totally different making our lives with no emotions and feelings and human beings would not be used to living in this manner. That is why we will never able to remove it from our lives

I saw a lot of different kinds of fish that I have never seen before. I also fed the penguins, watched dolphins jump out of the water, watched otters play with instructors. But what I like to do the most is just sitting and watch the marine species swim back and forth through the glass. I could see the beauty of them and I enjoyed it so much. I will definitely go there again. If we meet, do you want to come with me? Love, Lily

In my opinion, the office is crucial for an employee's mind and for the results of the company because the environment could influence the workers and the increaseas or decreases of the business which depend directly to their productivity. I think that it is very important to have an open design office in which there are no walls separating the workers. The employees' energy, their focus and mainly the teamwork could be influenced by the office. First of all, the environment should offer to workers strength, willingess and team spirit. An open design of an environment could influence people to establish collegial relations. Also the office would motivate the employees because they should be more competitive with their colleagues. Moreover, owing to the lack of walls which separate the employees they could create a happy workplace with their capacity to make friends or to become colleagues with closed relationships. On the other hand, enclosed workstations create stress, anxiety, nervousness, tiredness for employees because they spent all their time alone in their office and they fail to exchange stories, opinions or experiences with their colleagues. A bad point for this kind of environment could be the lack of motivation generated by the absence of time spent with the others. As a consequence, the employees will come to work without enthusiasm and they will not be productive. Their way of thinking and their capacity to work should be influenced by all of these. In conclusion, the positive trajectory of an employee could be influenced by an office. This space should transform a stressful and displeasure experience at work in a motivating, lovely and friendly one.

In this season you can do a lot of things, the weather always is good due to there are most hours of light. You can go to the beach or swimming pool although you stay at the mountains. That's the perfect season to hang out with your friends do a barbecue. Otherwise, you can travel a different countries and you enjoy their food and take a lot of pictures. In fact, you have many offers to travel any place, if you can imagine you can go there. However, the summer seems the most short season, because you enjoy a lot.

Do we need music in our lives? It's the question. Are there times when music is important? I'm sure, for example the cold war times when the music helped soldiers with fighting their enemies. They didn't give up because of music. How does music make us feel? There are variety of types of music, some of them make us happy, other ones make us sad. But definietly music takes a huge part in our feelings and emotions. What would life be without music? We can't say exactly, because people always were making music. They were making operas even in ancient Greece! That's why life without music can't be as good as this with it. That's why I'm pretty sure that we need music in our lives. People always wanted it in the past, and they also need it now, because life without music is not the same life.

The problem is there are still an area that no civilize than the city. I think it not just money that may affect the doctors but the city you will have moce fun that the rural for example in the city you can find the place that can cure you from tiredness such as a movie theatre or gym. Thi kind of place may not found in rural area. Let we look at the education problem, in my country students who need to be a doctor need to work hard in their studies as you know that in the city the education are better than the rural area. I think that is why we don't have much doctor in rural area because we don't have people to go back to work in their home.

I think no walls separating employees from their cowarkers is the most effective for work than enclosed stations. I think it because in the office we need to work together and if we separate from each other it will make employee think they need to work by themselves not work together. And, I also think it will need to be more space that usual because if you provide more space it will make employees think they have enough space to think that they not imprision in the office that will make them work better. No walls separating will make employees work together and not need to walk to reach to each other. I think both of employees and employers need to work in the same room if there is a small business. No one in company need to have a room to separate themselves from each other. If you have a separate room it will make you think you are important that the other that will lead to bad for the business.

I think that music has been made an important role in my life. My reasoning is as follows. Music can make us feel better. There is a variety of music in the world and each of them has different effects. For instance, if you listen to calm music while you are studying, you may concentrate on it and your grade will rise. If you listen to powerful music when you feel sad, you probably retrieve the courage and become a more brave person than before. Thus, music is significant in our life. If you remove the music from our everyday lives, you will feel lonely and sad. Also, musician and other people who were interested in music or instruments will lose their hobby and will feel everyday boring. For these reasons, I consider that music is necessary for us and never be able to remove.

In my opinion this kind of requirement must be abolish from school. I think it not important to have this for graduate from school. In my school this requirement doesn't proof anything all of students fake the proof and school doesn't do anything about it. In my country school do a lot of think that I think it not really important this type of requirement is one of them. The school said it will make students know how to work but they don't said what the benefit of this requirement. The education in my country is one of the worst in the world that full of thing that doesn't suit for study. They study hard but not effective and in the schoop it full of garbage thing. Actually, I don't think it will tell anything if you do it or not. As you might know that in school there are many teacher that have authority to approve volunteer work and each of them don't do it on the same way for example one teacher will approve this work but another might not. It lead to why the volunteer work does existed in the first place.

This review describes Write and Improve, a new writing tool for learners of English. This tool provides short leveled writing tasks for language learners. Students get immediate feedback on their mistakes. Much of the feedback is basic vocabulary and grammar mistakes which is very useful. The second type of feedback is when students don’t answer the questions or follow the task instructions even if their English is accurate. Both types of feedback are useful to students before they consult the teacher. The biggest problem is that the cost is 2.50 pounds per student per month paid BY THE TEACHER. Sorry but this just does not work in most educational contexts. At a university, the student must pay for their materials and the teacher has little or no budget. I signed up for one class for one semester with my research budget but that was a one-time thing, regular teachers including me are not going to use this service. They need to find a way for teachers to assign students to buy a semester’s subscription. I remember English Central had a similar problem at first but they figured it out. I hope Cambridge can figure it out too. Overall I would recommend using this site for pre-intermediate and intermediate students when you have full use of a computer lab or students have their own devices with good wi-fi connections. You should try the free version. At the moment I nannot recommend the paid version for teachers but I hope they make some small changes to make the paid version more useful.

good morning. I am writing to share my opinion about your last proposal. I read on the newspaper about your new proposal on banning mobile phone from public trasports and in shops and restaurants. First I would like to congratulate you for been so brave, you will be strongly criticised by those people who use execivelly their mobile phone. I am writing to you to say that I totally agree with your proposal. I think we live in a time where socialize is difficult, people prefer to use they mobile phone than talk to other humanbeens. I sometimes wen out with co-workers after work time. Most spent the whole night using their mobile phone, texting mesages to other people instead of talking to a person not less than one meter from them. It is afecting our relationships like society, I am afraid of the next generation will not be able to have a normal life because they will not have the same experience as we have today. Most of my happy memories are spanding time with people that enjoyed spending their time with me. what wories me sometimes is how people are easily distracted using their mobile phone on public places. I saw a car accident because a pedestrian was distracted using his phone and crossed the street without look at the traffic. This really scares me, when technology cause fatalities, I am glad to share my oinion with you. I hope your proposal can be accepted soon. Thank you very much for your attention mister town council.

I think all students should have to study music and all schools need to have music class that have as many of instrument that they can have. I think learn to play musical instrument will make students can find a way that they can enjoy by themseves. The reason that is why they need to have as much as musical instrument that they can because each student want to play various type of instrument some student what to play guitar and some want to play violin. Schools need to provide many musical instrument for support all students. And why is learning musical instrument is important? It is because school need to show the way of future to student, show what they can earn for living. The muscians is one of the way student can earn for living. I think not just music class all school need to have class just like repair or build something. The important thing is school need to have many various class as they can.

The process of the personal growth is often related to music, every guy is used to listening to lots of music especially in the times when they suffer because of the end of a relationship. These are some of the most important moments when young people listen to music, above all music with sad lyrics. Luckily, we listen to music also when we are in a state of excitement, and we want to escape from reality. Music can make us feel happy, but also we can have a feeling of malinconic memories when we think a person we have lost or we miss something that we would love to do. Some people say they could not live without music, and they are always looking for musical newness. I think they had better went to die instead of giving up to music.

Although some argue that which health and money would be valuable, in my opinion, health generates a significant portion of our lives and provide us with productive days. This essay will analyze the statement and gives a logical conclusion. First of all, human beings can no longer live without being healthy. Once they start having physical issues, it can be the highest pirority to undertake medical treatments. Most of patients would never think that they earn money as much as possible, if they were in serious situation. Therefore, they should keep their better bodies and mental status. People can consider how to earn more money once their body conditions settle down. Additionally, they can create effective ways to make their life more immesurable due to the fact that they saty healthy. Furthermore, having a productive life will make one's life enriched. For example, some might spend free time with their family and others might see the tremendous view of a mountain. The lifestyle can be resourceful without money and they can realize how critical living healthy is. In conclusion, although more would be an essential part of people's life, keeping stable mental as well as physical balance produces a great deal of benefits. I believe that being healthy outweighs the importance of money.

Even more than two thousand years ago when Plato was working on his masterpiec The Republic he knew that in his ideal state there would be music as one of the two basic knowledge of education of youth together with gymnastics. The music is something like fleshlight in your pocket. Even in the darkest times you can reach up and light at least a little bit of your journey. I believe that I shouldd be behaving depending on my rational brain and that I have to nurture my emotional brain all the time. However the music is about feelings. I know since I have been a little kid that the music is not just about the feelings of the song but that you can express your own as well by listening. It was Nietzsche who said that life without music would be mistake and I can't disagree.

Do we need music in our lives? The simple answer to the question above is yes. I cannot imagine a life without music at all. Without music, life is meaningless and has no color. Music is essential for me on any occasion, for example, when I am driving my car from home to work and vice versa, or when I am studying or doing exam preparation. Music has become a need for humans for many centuries because music plays an essential aspect in people's life, medicine for the brokenhearted. Life without music would be boring. According to some scientific research, music brings peace and tranquility to people's minds. Music helps us to stay sane in our difficult times. Music brings positive emotional brainwaves to our minds, which help us to stay calm and relaxed. That is why in every spa center, you will hear music playing in the background because it can make you calm. I live my life with music. I cannot live without it.

I would like to tell you about the autumn because it's my favorite season. For me, it's the most special season in the year - the leaves are falling down and it's getting colder. But I would like to tell you a bit more about it: First of all it's good to know that the autumn is also called “the golden season“. Why? It is really easy: In October, all leaves which are brown and gold are falling down from the trees. The second fact is, that these days are the last days, where the sun's shining with her whole power and the sun is golden too. That's why it is called the golden season. Why I like the autumn? Well, especially in October, as I said the sun is really nice and all the leaves are falling down. In my opinion, a second reason is that the temperature is really nice. It means that it is not to hot like in the summer, but it not as cold as in the winter. So for me, it is perfect!

Many people believe that the books will be replaced by digital devices in schools and universities. In my opinion, widespread computerisation is a good change because it can provide enormous benefits. The first and foremost pro is that it can reduce the rate of tree logging and deforestation. As many forests have been knocked down for the production of paper, using a computer or phone will automatically reduce the usage of books and it can be a best solution for this global issue. As a consequence, it can totally give a good impact on becoming a sustainable environment. The second advantage of using computers or tablets is that they are more compact and portable than the books. If individual pocesses a good interest access on her computer, she can search all information through the numerous educational websites and digital dictionaries, therefore, it is not necessary to carry a lot of heavy books to the universities. Consequently, students can more enjoy their university lives by using convenient digital devices. In conclusion, replacing computers and tablets instead of the paper-based materials in the schools is a good transformation for a better lifestyle.

Music is one of the most popular ways to express our emotions and thoughts regarding a lot of real life matters, in fact music is so important for us that every single civilization on the world has its music, with its particularities and expression. Music makes us feel better about life, about ourselves and even the reality, sometimes the best medicine that we could take is a good song the will improve our mood. In my opinion, life without music would be an error. I am not able to imagine a world where music is not present in daily life, helping with emotions and giving meaning to relationships.

I think music is something really special. Music has a long history: All people who lived before us did music, so in my opinion, music is one of the most important things in life. For example when we are in a bad mood, music helps us to get happier. Another point is that music helps you to calm down when you are stressed. There are a lot of other things why music good for us but I think these are the most important facts. In our lives, we often listen to music. Scientologists says, that we are listening to music about five hours a day. Speaking for me, I would say that I listen to music about one or two hours a day. Why? Especially in films or adds we're listening to music without realizing it. In my view, life without music would be really quiet and boring. That would makes us unhappy and depressive. In my view, music is one of the most important things in life.

I certainly think that doing some volunteer work is really good for society in general. Everyone should spend a part of life of doing that. On the other hand, I do not think doing volunteer work is something I should receive graduating for. I think when you graduate it is important to focus on your knowledge or you work. Doing your own project or things like that are more important for graduates rather than being a volunteer. Being a volunteer is really good. Because you help the people or a company and that is really generous work. However, you have to devote your time for it and when you study hard it is not that easy. The time is fundamental for studying and doing your work at school. As you have to do homework, write essays, learn for passing a test, study to get to another school, you do not have much time. And the year of graduating might be a bit stressful. In conclusion, I think that completing a certain amount of volunteer work should not be a requirement to graduate. And that is because it takes your time to really focus on graduating itself.

People are divided in the purpose of information resources. Some people think books should be taken over by electronic devices such as notepads and gadgets while others consider them as valuable items that conveys the culture that represents the time of publication. In my opinion, the existence of books will be preserved from now on. It is obvious that technology generates a siginificant role of our life. With the advancement of technology, it has bocame to connect people and their culture each other and in business making communication easier and faster. In other words, it would be possible for human beings to live a day without technology. On the other hand, there has been a great variety of things even though they are no longer latest. One of those representatives can be books. Not to mention, books provide immeasurable benefits for the young generation to the elderly. For example, some people would remember that their parents read different variety of books when they were little or younger. It can be said that reading various kinds of books can lead to raise not only imagination but also communication skills. Therefore, thousands of works have been published all over the world. In conclusion, although the power of technology is indubitable, books produce a great deal of merits for our community. I strongly believe that books take a significant role in this modern society.

Music has become a friend of all of us, and you can also become a musician!

A long calm life or a short intese one. I think that live a life that worth is the principal goal of any human being. So, I would prefer a short intense life that worth instead of a long nonsense life. The principal reason is that I want to travel to a lot of different places and knowing the culture and life there. I also want to learn as much as I can and create precious moments during my lifetime and if these reasons mean to live a short life but intense, I prefer create memories and live the day every day. I have always wanted to know different parts of the world because I am really interested in cultures and customs from different parts of the world and how behaviour or way of living from one city to another or one country to another change is fascinating for me. Thus, I would love to live travelling and living experiences in my life. Another reason why I prefer an intense short life is because I like to learn and knowing a lot. So, I would like to learn as much as I can in different fields of science or life. I do not mean how longer I can learn, I just want to learn and try to comprehend the world around us. I definitively prefer live a worth life than a long life. I want to live a life that can be an inspiration of everybody or at least to people around me.

University life is different when you live alone or you live with your family. Both cases have pros and cons, but, to me, the better options are living with family. In my experience university could be stressful and you most of the time don't have enough time to do many activities so, if you live with your family, it facilitates a lot of things such as you don't have to pay attention too expensive bills or making food. Above that when you live with your family you have more time to focus on your studies and you don't have to pay much attention to other things. When you live with someone who cares about you, university life is easier to deal with. In conclusion, if you have the opportunity to choose among go or stay with your parents during your university degree, you definitively should choose the second option because your university life becomes easier.

As members of a society we sometimes are asked to step up and help other people or the community around us. In some intitutions, like our high schools, it's done through mandated volunteer work. Is it right? Must students be obliged to do volunteer work in order to graduate? Can the words obliged, mandated and volunteer be written in the same sentence? In our everyday lives we are surrounded by the problems our society faces, when we turn on our TVs or connect to the internet we se a lot of people strugling to have something to eat, places devasteted by storms and flooding, the famine in Africa, etc. Being aware of all that is happening it's obivious that something must be done, so it's our responsibility to give support for those in need and sometimes the best way to do it is through volunteer work. We have to find ways to encourage volunteer work and our educational system have the places where we can nurture our individuals to care for the problems of our society. Since kindergarten our children must be aware of its complexity, respecting their ages and undertanding capabability of course, in order to be ready to take action when it's needed. As previously stated, of course we need citizens willing to help our society, but this envolvement must be achieved with education and not obligation. The obligation is in the hands of our institutions that can encourage students using win-win solutions that connect those in need with those with the resources and responsibility to help.

Everybody has ever listened to or sung some music at least once in their lifetime; there are so many people who have had the opportunity to enjoy a concert or sing a composition in front of a stage and from all of this it is amazing how people can connect through music and can share different emotions through different melodies. Furthermore, it is well-known that music can stimulate our mind and can nurture our soul; after all there's always a song for every occasion, such as when we are feeling under weather or having a really difficult time, there are some songs which either make us feel a little bit more relaxed, or can raise our mood and motivate us to keep going, it is important to remark that music allows us to feel all emotions that we experience in our lives. Apart from that, we are able to connect our mind and physical coordination when we dance at the rythim of the music at the same time we can feel relaxed and happy due to we liberate oxytocin and dopamine which are often called happiness hormones, as a result that we can get benefits in our physical and mental health Besides, the music is vital to make memories with those who we love and care for; we hold bonds through music and every time we listen to that melody we can remember a special moment, such as a birthday, a date, a wedding, a dancing, or just a loved person's smile. On the other hand, a long time ago Nietzsche said "Without music, life would be a mistake," and I completely agree with him, if we didn't have music we would miss a way to express our feelings, we wouldn't be able to fully enjoy a great moment or we wouldn't be able to put in words and notes our sorrow. Finally, I consider music not only enrich our lives and minds but also allows us to create memorable moments and convey our overflowing emotions.

Today's world, studying at university becomes more and more significant for the young generation and it seems to be a most efficient way to learn about life. To my way thinking, studying abroad is much more preferable in as much as that it contributes you younger to be wise adults in three ways as follows. The first and foremost reasons for my choice is that many students do not have a chance to learn how to manage money. For instance, they do not get used to pay bills for electricity or distribute money to other necessary items. However, a university student has to pay attention to make compulsory payments, otherwise he or she has to burn midnight oil in real terms. Another reason which absolutely deserves some words here is that staying at home during university years means beating a dead horse. I mean, studying at university teaches young brains something about life not only for landing jobs but also becoming a social, conscious person. Additionally, it paves the way for taking these opportunities and for having fun to take decisions without any interference of parents. On the other hand, sitting next to lovely dad and mom provides the same life style as if being a student at high school. Lastly, it will be worthwhile to study away from sweet home since it accustomes both children and parents to live separately. For parents, this milestone causes them to be able to travel without any responsibility. For students, they can find good jobs in other big cities while interning in big companies. In a nutshell, it is the time to live freely and take their own decisions even though they might be wrong. With the aim of learning life easily, students should study abroad. Otherwise they will miss the boat.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that music lessons are taking in a very relaxing way between Spanish schools, since most young people actually can not read a music sheet or playing an instrument. Consequently, not many people work on music field, and those studies arrive to the luckiest people. On the one hand, learning music is a productive activity for spending time, in contrast to playing video games or watching TV, since the learner adquire a concentration ability, furthermore he could get a musician titulation, besides you won't need a university degree to get a job. Moreover, creativity develops faster, whose it is an essential part for future jobs. Think on Mozart, he started to play piano at the age of five, and when he went to his first concert, he had composed his first song before. On the other hand, music studies require most of time and not all people are patient. Also, music needs constance to go on it, so students must love the area. Another crutial point is money, what is necesary for studies access. Most actual singers and musicians have learned music in a very intensive way, and that is what have lead them to follow their dreams. To summarise, I think music is important anyway, even if you don't understand music notes, because it takes a huge part in our live.

It is an important subject and it is also controversial because a lot of people have different idea about it but in my opinion I believe that money is very important in our life. I am not saying that is the most important but to have money do you that your life to be more easy because you can have many things that you can't to have and it also involved things that you need for your health. For example if you have a serious disease and that disease need to buy medicine very expensive and you are not money to buy that then you are going to die because you are not afford. I think that every person must have the necessary things but there are other people that criticises you when you have aspiration to have more money. They say that you are greedy because you want to have more money. I know that money is not all in the life but money can solve many things in your life that they are very important for your health.

More and more learners have got involved themselves into tackling to acquire various types of language skills these days, compared to the past days. Some argue that studying foreign language is simply a waste of time. However, in my opinion, learning new things such as language generates an essential part of the person's life. To commence with, not to mention learners can have easy way to contact diverse culture as well as people from walks of life. If they are familiar with the local language, they can try to understand such as manners, rituals and etiquette and so on. Following on from this, to give an example, tourists who already have knowledge of the local language and destination in advance can make the trip more enriched. Additionally, one's career chance would be broaden. It is likely that people who have particular knowledge of language can make effective use of it. For instance, they would be surprised a number of things that they can expect even if they go on a business trip to another area that they are not willing to go. That can lead to gaining their life experiences and they could accomplish it without the skills. What is more, practioners can spend productive life. Largely, learning language will never end and make easily learners give up. On the other hand, once they keep chellenging the task that would not be necessary, they can be more confident in themselves. To establish the time schedule to study, they can be more self-discipline. In conclusion, although there would be no point of learning international language to some people, I am convinced that the way provides us with valuable chances to make one's life more effective. Therefore, it would be advantageous to learn language.

Dear Sir/ Madame I am writing this letter to you because I wanted to express my opinion on the new decision you will be trying to implement and with it I hope to change your settlement of banning the use of mobile phones in some public places. As we all know, our phones have become a part of our everyday life, an object most people cannot live without, I am not judging because I also find myself in that category. I certainly understand why the town council has decided to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport, in shops and in restaurants, but I also consider that it is a bit of an exaggerated decision. I opt to believe that the main reason why we use our phones so much is because we try to make the best out of our precious time, and our phones can be of great help for reaching out to our close ones which may live away from us, so the only time we really get to talk to them is while on a bus or when buying groceries. Furthermore, I strongly agree with banning the utilization of our phones in restaurants due to the fact it might be a great change and people will have no choice but to socialize rather than using their phones for more than half the time they spend at the restaurant waiting for an incredibly short dopamine rush from a notification they just received. Thank you for your attention and I hope you will take my letter into consideration. Yours faithfully, Florin

In my opinion is important to tell the truth I don't there are acceptable to tell a lie. Ofcause, it may be hurt my feeling if someone tell me the truth but I always prefer them to tell me the hurtful truth than cheerful lie. When I have a reflect from anyone when it is the truth I think if I know them then I fix what have I done something wrong it will benefit of me than just pretend I don't done something wrong or lie to me. If you do that I don't know what I'm done wrong if I don't then it impossible for me to correct it later. This situation will make something worst in the next time. That is why I think it will be good if you just tell me the truth. I have watch a movie recently it about the family that don't tell the truth about his one of member illness.

Many students and their parents get in a dilemma when it comes to allowing their child to study while he's away or making him stay back home and continue his higher studies from a local university. In my opinion, students must stay with their parents and pursue their education from their home university as it guarantees a safe and secure environment for them to study, while also allowing students to be financially independent thus helping them to concentrate on their studies. It is a known fact that parents love and care for their children and ensure no harm comes their way. This parenting ensures a safe and secure environment in which the student can focus on his studies. For instance, a close friend of mine had gone to Canada for his higher studies. Soon reaching there, he started to have difficulty adjusting to the new environment and also started feeling home sick. Hence, he had to quit his studies midway and return home to his parents. Due to this complex of feeling insecure in a new and an unknown environment, some students find it difficult to stay away from home, for extended periods. On the other hand, students who live alone, away from their parents and study, often have to worry about their extra expenses. As they have to pay for the accommodation, food, study material etc. They are compelled to work in a part-time job. This is not the case with those students who stay home with their parents and are able to focus on their education. For example, almost 90% of Cambridge University student living in college hostel complained of not getting sufficient time to complete their assignments and tutorials which have negatively affected their grades. As a result, students who stay home are able to devote more time towards their coursework, since they do not have to work part time to pay for any the above expenditures. In conclusion, in my opinion, students are far better off staying with their parents while they are studying. This way a student can better focus on his lectures and get good grades as his parents are close by to take care of him and he does not need to worry about paying for any extra expenditures.

If I was asked about the life expectancy, preferring having a 100-year and calm life or having a shorter lifespan but much more fatigue, frankly, I would rather take the first one, having a long life and living as cool as a cucumber as there are two main reasons corresponding to family and individual. To begin with the first reason, I am convinced that the ultimate journey of each person is to build a beautiful family. Furthermore, spending more time taking deliberately care of our children as human beings is also considered as a magnificent habit of a human being, thus, the more time we have, the more care we give to our children and the more joyfulness we gain in return. Additionally, if I am blessed to live until that age, I will hold my spouse's hand, take a stroll in our garden, evoke our good old days and thanks to her for her sacrifices to our family. Moreover, I can imagine the distinction between living a long calm life and a short intensive one. From my perspective, I presume this is about the grief when passing away too soon to see our children grow up, or even worse, witness our beloved ones struggle lonely for the family livelihood. If I were in this circumstance, I would not forgive myself because of my impulsive incidence. Importantly, I prefer a long lifespan coinciding with being patient as this is my temperament, influencing others on seeking a meaningful life and, literally, encouraging the society to be better.

As a result, many believe that mandatory exercises three times a week must be introduced in educational establishments, including both schools and universities. And while I do agree that people should be more physically active, I am opposed to the idea of doing it forcefully. To begin, it is obvious that most of the children and youth prefer to watch a TV or play a video game in their spare time, rather than spending it outside playing with peers or merely taking a walk. Consequences of such decisions include obesity and related illnesses. Thus, physical activity is needed in order to reduce health problems and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, according to various studies exercising multiple times a week decrease the chance of developing diseases like diabetes, blood pressure as well as a cardiovascular conditions. In addition, being active is said to improve psychological health and reduce stress and depression. It is also believed that playing sports helps to relax mentally. Therefore, increase study performance. However, I strongly disagree that exercising must be obligatory due to the following reasons. First and foremost, making anything compulsory decreases pupils’ and students’ interest in participating in it. As it is accepted that young people see such actions as a limitation of their free will. Hence, their motivation plunges. Secondly, during the PE lessons, teachers compare students’ accomplishments to each other, rather than comparing their results individually. Settings it for others who may have a good background in physical training can adversely affect an individual's self-confidence and lead to mental disorders such as stress, depression and physical discomfort. In the final analysis, I believe that being physically active is essential in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Although I do not agree that PE lessons must be compulsory. From my perspective, exercising and playing sports give better results when individuals themselves show interest in participating.

The majority of people have a belief that we will be always speaking true in our society. In my opinion, we can skip telling a truth to others for being a good communication with them. Unfortunately, it has both pros and cons on both statements. In this essay, I will illustrate with relevant examples to elaborate further. To be honest, it is not an easy to tell the facts all the times in society. While speaking genuine, you may face struggles at initial phases. But, in future you will have a better relationship with each of us. In addition, we never feel any guilty inside when you are honest. Furthermore, people will also appreciate your loyalty. For example, we have to be truthful to all my friends and family, which built trust in their heart. Because, you are with them in the whole life. It hurts, but we stay true to them. However, telling a truth is going to be risky at some times. Certainly, we have to lie to escape on critical situations. Moreover, to make others happy you will speak lie on certain situations. For instance, Office is not the safest environment to speak facts on every-time. It builds a negative impression with staff, which effects badly on your work. At certain times, you have to skip to make healthy and prosper interaction to all our colleagues. In conclusion, we have to tell the truth with our friends, relatives and other applicants. At the same time, you can lie to strangers. End of the day, you have to maintain good and healthy relationship to each and everyone.

I believe that young people shouldn't be forced to do sports activities although it's healthy and necessary for them . Theese days everyone especially young people are not doing sports activities anymore because now the lifestyle is becoming more and more sedentary . Lifestyle has changed a lot in the last few decades . Young people are not interested anymore in sports . They'd rather use their devices such as mobile phones and computers than going outside and play football or basketball. Teens need to play sports because they are developing and this would help them develop healthier . It has been shown that teens who do sports at least 3 times a week develop healthier and happier . These people is very important because now teens start developing their muscles and doing sports is going to help them to become more muscular . Sports could help children develop their social skills and be able to make friends . Socialising is necessary for the mental health of children. Theese days children had forgotten to socialise because the electronic devices kept their attention and time . Indeed the times have changed but children mustn't forget about sports and socialising. Indeed it's very important for young people to do sports but they shouldn't be forced because they are going to lose their interest in sports . Instead children should be encourege to do sports activities. Like advertising more in schools organising more activities such as football championships , basketball matches or running competitions with prizes. If we take these measures we will be able to increase the interest in sports among young people. They would love to do sports if they will find it interesting and engaging. They are the new generation , aren't they ? . If we did something the situation wouldn't be like this. We should do something, shouldn't we ?

The start of a school year is always fun. You reunite with your friends that you have not seen them in a while. You meet your new teachers as well, and most importantly, you write your goals down for the new year. In school we have several sucjects. Some of them I am good at. While others need some improvement. Let us take a look at them. and find out my plan for the next year. I love languages, what ever the language was. learning languages is always fun and superb, because it gives us the chance to communicate with other people in another parts of the world. But of course there are some subjects that I do not like that much, in short, they are chemistry and physics. It is not that I do not like the practical aspect of them, because it is so interesting. Their theoretical apsect is boring. I think that this aspect needs a lot of working this year. Now, my plan to achieve my goals is pretty simple.

It is crucial to go on a vacation once in a while, because it helps us release the tenstion that we all suffer from in our lives. Some of these vacations are remarkable, maybe because of the place that we went to, or maybe because we were so tense back then, and the vacation was necessary for us. Today I am writing about one of these delightful vacations. Two years ago, I went to Spain on Christmas. This holiday was the best one I ever had. I went to Valencia, and it is a beautiful city on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. The most amazing thing about Valencia is the mixture between the past and the present. We saw monuments that belongs to the period of Muslim rule. I also went to the Mestalla stadium. which belongs to my favorite football club, Valencia. This was the highlight of my vacation. This was the best vacation I've ever taken for two reasons. First and foremost, because I adore the city. Second, I was very focused at work that year, and I needed a vacation like that to relax.

Health is the most important thing in our lives. If our health was poor then we will not be able to enjoy life anymore. We all saw wealthy people who suffered from untreatable diseases and died. The paradox is that their money couldn't help them. Exercise is a huge part of healthy living. It is crucial to do sports on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis. sport is vital for our bodies in so many ways. But, is exercise the only thing that we should do? The answer is: absolutely not. Sport is essential, but it is not enough. Cutting harmful habits might be more important than exercise, eating healthy food is critical as well. The worst unhealthy habit ever is smoking. The problem is that it does not just effect the people who smoke. It also affect their surroundings. It is proven that smoking kills millions of people every year, so we have to cut it out of our lives. It is necessary to eat healthy food in order to keep our bodies and minds healthy. It includes fruits, vegetables, and grains. Eating healthy food also means that we should not consume junk food daily.

Learning to play instruments can be a wise way to spend your time - it improves memory and exercises your brain to focus better. Studying music, combined with testing your abilities to play have quite a few positive outcomes. To start with, the majority of students like to complain about lack of enthusiasm and action in schools, as well as no place to expand your creativity. What could be a better place than a music class? The music itself has the power to form new passions or even relationships. Studies have shown listening and playing have an amazingly surprising impact on one's brain. In a music class, when you meet new people and share your interest, you can not only make new friends but also develop a better understanding of how sound works. It can be useful for physics students! Moreover, having a music class in between other lessons can cause you to feel more focused after. After all, music class should be about discovering new genres, artists, and instruments, which is not only developing for a brain but also relaxing. With a more stable and quiet state of mind, students are proven to perform in other classes much better. Thirdly, learning to play new instruments can cause one to uncover new passions, which, in the future, can result in finding a new job or just impressing potential partners with one's abilities. All in all, I think music classes are a perfect opportunity to try something new and come upon people sharing similar interests. Nonetheless, I understand how some of the students are against it, arguing they already don't have enough time for basic classes. My opinion is that the classes should be extracurricular, in order to actually gather people who want to learn new skills.

Unlike travelling in the past. It is easy to travel today in our modern world. There are many kinds of vehicles. Cars, airplanes, ships, and trains.

Considering unhealthy lifestyle of students and importance of exercise, I agree with the idea that students are forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Firstly, many students these days do not do sports activities actively. While a few decades ago, it was ordinary for students to spend their free time doing sports, as there were not many other options. However, with the emergence of techonology, many young people started to play games and be on social medias rather than moving their body to do sports. This change in the attitude of youth towards sports is certainly not desirable as doing sports while young is extremely important to stay healthy and live longer. Young ages are biologically most suitable for making their body strong as it is the time when body cells are most proliferated. When people reach a certain age, making numerous cells would be no longer possible and thus start to decline. Therefore it is critical for people to build strong body while young so that they can retain the good condition for longer. Considering how students are doing sports activities less and less, forcing them to participate in sports would be a great measure for the sake of students. Another point is that doing sports would be a good opportunity for students to build a strong bond with each other. Many sports require people to team up and compete with the other teams. This characteristics make students to learn about the importance of cooperation because otherwise they would not be able to win the game. In addition, since team members have to be cooperative, even the team members were strangers to each other, they would eventually be able to be friends. Moreover, doing sports could affect the other aspects of students' life positively. It is known that by doing exercise, people feel refreshed and they can focus on study more than when they did not. Thus, overall improvement including physical and mental condition could be well estimated.

I believe that speak English has always been important because it is the way that you have to communicate with other people. Speak English is so important as it was in the past and I believe that it will never change. The different now and in the past is that before it was more difficult because you don't have all the tools that you have now and you had to find the way you had to learn English. Before you don't have all the application that you have now. For example you have several tools that can help you to study the structure and grammatical time in English and you also have another application that help you to communicate with other people and that can help you to practise your pronunciation. Today you can search for web page on the internet where they help you to practise your listening with podcast. You have a lot of content in English that they help you in all the process that you need for learning English. But there are many people that they want not to learn English because they think that all the tools that we have now there are enough to communicate and it is not true at all because all the tools can help you in a specific moment but not in all the case.

For me, music is the important thing in our life. I don't know what's going on without music some days. Music was created for everyone, for every single ages and music is well-known everywhere in the earth. People listen to music when they feel sad, happy or when they are studying, or when they need motivation... there are many kinds of music nowadays. I usually listen to music about 3-4 times in my typical day. First when I wake up to make up my mind after a long night. In my opinion, chill music is the best one for these moments, its slow melody is going to help you with more focus. The second time when my commute, I just want to listen to cancel the noise in the street that you could getting stressful. The third time when my workout, music gives motivation to complete all of my task. And the last one before I going to sleep, a little ballad music make me feel better after a long day.

Considering the globalization of the world, learning to speak a foreign language is important than ever before. Firstly, most international businesses are done by a global language, namely English. With the help of technology and transportation, the market is now expanded from the nation to the world, and companies are making deals with not only those from same countries but also with the ones from abroad, which is possible only if they could communicate by using the same language. Thus to succeed in bussiness, people need to learn foreign languages. Another point is that more cooperation with other nations are needed to solve the global issues. Currently, the world is confronted with global warming, overpopulation, and numerous other problems. These are grave enough to threaten the whole planets and all living creatures. To deal with such immense issues, nations should have constractive conversations which can be possible with smooth understanding available by a common language. Given that immediate actions for the planet are necessary, necessity of learning new language to disccuss the solution is higher than the past. Overall, importance of learning a foreign lanuage is higher than the past.

Medicine is a noble specialization, it needs a decent, kind, and nice person to work within, but doctors are also humans like all of us, and they need to earn money, in order to implement that; they work in cities, leaving the rural areas with a limited number of doctors, causing a problem, what is the solution? Before we dig in the solution, we should understand the reasons. It is obvious that cities are more profitable for doctors, and we cannot blame them for their desire to earn money. Yes, medicine is a humanitarian job, but that does not mean that they should earn less money than everyone else. If we thought about it, we can see that it is not just about the docotors. Rural areas are less profitable for most of the other jobs, because there are fewer people there, which means less demand for everything. Now, what is the solution? Actually, solving the doctors problem in rural areas is part of the whole rural areas problem. Legislation should be made by Governments to encourag docotors to move to rural areas. They also should give them monthly incentives as a reward for their effort in solving this problem. We cannot blame doctors on this issue. It is the government's duty to solve these kinds of problems.

The shape and design of our work spaces are critical, and it is proven that these two things affect our productivity and psyhcological status during work. Some offices contain cubicles, which are an enclosed workstation, while others contain an open work spaces. So the question needs to be asked is, which one of them is better? I believe that the worst design for an office ever is the one including cubicles. Cubicles will make the employees feel like they are in jail, and their cubicles are their own cells. When the employee feel this way, you cannot expect him to do a superb work. In order to make the employee more productive, you should make him feel like he is still have some of his freedom, even though he has to work seven of eight hours per day. I think it is obvious that I do not prefer enclosed workstations. Instead, I love open ones, because it is going to give the employee a better feeling about his job, rather than him thinking about it like jail. So within the design of our offices we should send a message to our employees that this place is theirs, this feeling could help them be more productive and invested in their jobs.

Could you imagine a zoo with a big area where animals can be like in the wild forest. I think all the discussion about zoo and freedom of animals become less important if the zoo have adapted conditions to keep the animals happy to live in this place. This condition will be the only solution to allow us to reconciliate animal's life and need for people to discover these different animals vicinity their home. I propose that all the zoo was adapted for each animal they want to keep

I believe that there are activities a person should do at least once in his life. Public speaking, painting a wall, conquering a fear, and volunteering. Why volunteering? I read about some high schools which require the student to complete a certain amount of volunteering time in order to graduate. I really respect and love this idea, and I think I am going to send these schools a letter thanking them for this superb gesture. Volunteering is the best activity the person can do when he is young. It helps them appreciate the value of time. Today, most of the young people are spending an enormous portion of their time on social media, which is a total waste of time. When they vounteer, they will understand that their time could be spent on more beneficial activities. Volunteering can change their thoguhts about several subjects as well. Which happened to me, volunteering helped me see the world in a more gracious way. A complaint most arise from some studnets who do not want to volunteer, what they did not thoguht about is that going to a school is a privilge, because not everyone can afford it, so they are lucky enough to be at school. and I assume that if they thought about it for a while they will not reject it anymore.

Offices vary from each other mostly with designs and atmosphere surrouding the place. Do these two have any connection? Apparently, yes! People are herd animals - the work is more effective in the groups or pairs. Open space in the office have many benefits, one of them being people learning to be more cooperative and trustworthy. Coworkers can get to know each other better, which will benefit in the future. While working on important projects, workers have to join forces and brainstorm together. Without the previous socialization with one another, the work wouldn't be effective. No walls in the office is a fantastic idea from the psychological view, too. Workers do not feel confined by the small, almost claustrophobic cabines. It leads to a betterment of mental health and overall well-being of the employees. Interacting with others - from consulting and analyzing to telling jokes and spending time together - results only in positive effects. Happy employees equal quality work - that is why it is important to remember about the company's building design.

Many people like to study near their home to see each evening their family, but for me I prefer living abroad to discover new people and areas. The second one choice is difficult because you need to change your habit. That is also the goal of studying to have occasion to do different news things and meet new situations. I'm difinitively to study abroad because you learn in immersion. That's not something abstract but very practical and concrete. This way to study is better to memorize situations and languages. You have also more occasions to meet interesting and openmind people because this type of people like to people different from others. In general these person are very courageous to be able to meet people from different countries. Often, these people have an other way to think.

Nowadays, people have access to numerous information. The variety of human preferences is huge and vast. In my opinion, every person is unique, so everyone could have different options regarding his life. I tend to think that a calm and long life is my desire. On one hand, the person's behavior means a lot for his type of life. In general, people have had their actions made depending on their attitude. I would like to argue that it is crucial to enjoy every moment. Furthermore, the most relevant aspect is to choose your own lifestyle. If it comes to my feelings, I will say that I appreciate a calm life because of my character. If you have an outgoing personality, you will probably tend to choose a more intense life. On the other hand, as far as I am concerned, in general, humans want a long life. I would like to argue that it does not matter the longevity of life in a choice related to life intensity. If I aspire to a peaceful and harmonious life, I will have this preference despite its durability. Moreover, people have their activities felt in a different way. As far as I know, the more intensity an action is, the happier you are. Nevertheless, a calm and long life could offer numerous pleasant activities which can be equal with a short, but deep and energetic life. In conclusion, human preferences could be so different. A long and calm life can be always the best choice because you have the opportunity to make many extraordinary memories in such a lengthy and relaxed life.

It is never acceptable to tell a lie. Why do we keep telling lies anyway? It's a terrible thing to do and it's a terrible precept to live by. It's important to always tell the truth, always be honest with yourself and with others. When a person lies, she first of all is lying to herself and this is a terrible mistake. For example, when I first lied to my mom about what I was feeling, I wasn't able to make a connection with her, she couldn't help me with my mental health issues, so I kept lying but at the end of the day that was killing me inside because it only kept us apart. Furthermore, it's not a good choice to lie and in some countries is a crime condemned by law. With lies, you can destroy people's lives and this will come back to you way more stronger. We never like it when people lie to us, a fake person is never welcome in our environment and whenever that happens we feel betrayed and that person is not seen as a good person at all. In addition, honesty is an important value that we should keep in our thoughts and reflect about our attitudes towards others and the consequences of our lies, because it has serious damage and no one likes it.

Music is important not only for pleasure but also for entertainment. Everyone has to struggle in their lives. At that time, they need to reduce their stress. Thare are many ways to be relaxed. Among them, Listening to music is one of the best way to relax or to boost our mind. Moreover, we can feel and touch different ideas, different feelings, different rhythm, and different creativity by listening to music. It makes us to be happy, and to be soft our heart too. Without music, probably life would be bored or not interested at all. In addition, there would be no place for the composers or singers to share their feelings. Therefore, I think that music is essential for everyone. It support us to be happy, to be relaxed, to get the energy for our life now and forever. And it will be one of the important roles of people's lives.

Approximately, all of us hear music on a daily basis, and everyone has his own taste, the common thing is that music help us get through the day, and although some music might make us sad and a little down, it does help us in a way or another. When we were kids, our school had a music class in it. We all liked it, because it is not the kind of class that needs concentration, it was a little rest in our busy day. Back then, we thought that every school teaches music; later we found out that it is not true. So the question that pops in our head would be: Is it important to teach music in schools? I believe in the importance of teaching music in schools, but it should be an option for the students, because not all of them are interested, like they are not all interested in physics or math. When I was a student, the music class was mandatroy, so I did not have the chance to take it or leave it. I might not be interested in music, but in my book, I think it is important for students to have the opportunity of learning music. Music is a tasteful form of art, and it is imprtant to give the interested children a chance to learn it.

When we grow up, we start taking care of ourselves, because we cannot stay under the umbreall of our parents forever, and that is normal. It is a sign of maturity. While studying university, some students move away and live in a different city away from their parents. While others study in their home town with their families. So, which is better? In my book, I think the best idea is moving away during college. Yes, it may be hard at first, but that is an experience that will teach you how to live without someone looking out for you all the time. You are on your own, you will learn to cook, clean, do the dishes, and all of these tasks that you probably would not know how to do before. It also can teach you financial independence, but it depends on how you earn the money. If you get it from your parents, then you will learn a little. but if you earn it by working, then you will be more flexible about dealing with money and such. The experience of living by your own during college is necessary. You should stay away from durgus and crazy things, but other than than, I advise you to go for it.

Music is universal and it has some common language for all of us. Even if we do not know words or it has written in some other foreign language, its melody catches us, make you feel some emotions. I think music is another feature in our lives. Everybody has different tastes of music and when they have some situations, music will be there always for them. When they get happy, playing joyful music and having fun with themselves and sometimes they share this happiness with their close; when they hurt, or their heart is broken, they listen to music because it has some healing effects. Even in medical care, some times, doctors try to music as a treatment for their patient's psychology. to conclude, I do not know what life would be without music because I never have experience but I assume it could be boring and big blank in our lives.

Most young students do not work-out. That is why, most universities want to force there students to work-out at least 3 times a week. The Universities want to make sports a, most do, activity at school and if you do not sport 3 times a week you have to do the year over. I think young students should work-out at least 1 time a week. However I do think the rules of doing the year over goes to fare. Even though working out is good for you fysiek and mental. That is why the universities should make sport obligated for 2 times a week. Firstly, because sports is good for you fysiekly and mental. You get in better shape and feel better. you also find more peace and can focus better at school, but also at home. Secondly, It should be obligated for 2 times a week, owing to all the students who struggle with there weight. It would be a great opertuinitie for them to learn about there weight and do something about it if they want to. If it working out will be an obligated, their should also be a class to learn about food and how your body response at food and sports. However, I do think making sport an obligating is for some students too much. Because nobody knows if 3 extra classes every week is something that is realistic. Since not everyone has a great home situation. Some student have work after school or have to help with cleaning at school. So these students could get overworked. All things considered, making sports an obligation would be a great idea to make students feel better. But some students will get overworked and tired, because they have other things to do after school to what takes a lot of energy.

Music impacts our life a lot. It influences our emotions such as happiness, sadness, depression, or anxiety. There are always suitable types of music for all situations in our life. Music plays an important role in our major life events such as weddings, graduation, or birthday. It creates more happiness or alleviates sadness. For example, joyful music makes us happier on our birthdays, especially when our friends and relatives gather together to sing a Happy Birthday song for us. Sad music heals our broken hearts when we lose beloved ones. Music reminds me of what happened in the past with both sweet and bitter memories, making my life more meaningful. Sometimes, music could be used as a tool to show love without speaking directly. In my opinion, life would be so boring without music. People might behave inappropriately since there is no music to guide their minds and actions. Finally, we should enjoy music as it has many benefits. We should spread good music with meaningful messages to others to enjoy. Music is indispensable in life.

Each morning I was getting up early to take advantage of the cool temperature just before the sun wake up. I went to the baker to buy the fresh bread just out of the oven.

Time flies. You can see how it's changing people and nature as well. One season starts and another ends. But have you ever thought which one of them is your favourite? Mine is definitely spring, and let me explain to you why. In summer it's too hot, and during the winter and autumn it's too cold, so spring is somewhere in the middle with optimum conditions. Of course I'm simplifying now. The weather is not the only reason why I love this season of the year so much. But at this point I have to add it's really appealing to me. It's a beautiful time of the year. Everything is waking up from the winter sleep. Plants are growing and painting the world in green, with all those leaves and grass. Birds return from Africa, and every morning sing to you their outstanding songs. It feels like the whole world is joyful, and this happy excitement can be infectious. Cut the long story short, I love spring in my country. You should spend some time outdoors during that period, and if you enjoy being close to nature, as much as I do, you will fall in love with that season.

I think sometimes music is important because it makes us feel better and to concentrate. I think music makes us feel all sorts of things, depending what type of music we're listening to, for example, if we're listening to pop music, it can make us feel happy and full of energy, or, if we are listening to classical music like mozart it can make us feel very relaxed. I think life without music would be very boring and sad, because music makes us feel different and more happy, I also think music is a very big part of the world because music and making music is a way for us human beings to express ourselves in creative and fun way. Also a life without muisc wouldn't be fun, because you can dance with music and sing songs, and all of these activities are really fun.

Firstly, the music is essential in human beeings lives. Even the child in mother's womb before it has been born is able to react to a melody. There are studies, which proves, that playing a Mozart's rhytms to these children may help evolving their brains and these kids have brilliant minds. Although we do not put a higher focus on the music itself, a background tune may have a significant benefits on our ability to concentrate on a certain problem. Plenty of surgeons listen to a relaxing music while they are in the surgery room since it has a flourishing effect for their work. To add more, a lot of people prone to evaluate others according to the kind of music they are listening to. Only a style of a music may connect people with the same feelings. We may see huge groups of people visiting metal gigs. They all share the same enthusiasm for that kind of music while different group of people see metal music just as a discordant tune without any sense.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you as I wish to bring up the matter concerning the banning of the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. I am speaking in the name of our community when I say that this idea is quite exaggerated and I also suggest that you should do the opposite and offer free wi-fi in some areas of the town. Firstly, as many students reside in our town, they will all need to use their mobile phones or gadgets to keep in touch with professors or colleagues. Not only that but human connection is necessary nonetheless. Since we all have relatives that live far away from us, we have to keep in touch. By banning the use of mobile phones in public spaces like these, the town's popuation will be distressed and outraged. Also, in case of emergencies such as a car accident, people will need to use their phones. Secondly, the banning of mobile phones in public places can bring up the rate of crimminal activity. More people will use their phones while the authorities would not be paying attention thus taking up the risk of getting charged with a fine. I do not suppose you wish to have a town that is renamed for housing crimminals. Simply implying that people will suddenly stop using their phones is absurd in this case. I thank you for considering my opinion on this matter and I hope it helped you make a better decision. Yours faithfully, Anna Todd.

Music is one of the most enjoyable things in the world. Everyone listens music. There are so many kinds of music and every person loves a different kind of music. Therefore, people do love music and music is important for them. Can people live without music or if there is not any kind of music how would be the lives of people? These are the questiouns that everyone answers differently, but it is sure that without music people cannot live. If we want to answer that questioun what would life be like if there is not any music, we have to find someone who has never listened to music. However, there is no one who has never listened to music in his or her life. So that without music, people cannot live. People have been doing music for centuries. A person who lived in antic times listened to music and a person who live in the 21st century is still listening to music. Thus, people have been doing music since they are exist. To sum up, without music people cannot live. They are always creating new music. And thus music is important for everyone whether he lived in antic times or 21st century.

Music can also make you happy for example when you had a hard day at work you can listen to music and it will maybe cheer you up. Music is also socially important because people sing songs together and go to concerts together which improves there relationships. If there wasn´t any music in the world I think the world would be a lot more boring because music is an exciting thing and if you are really good at it you could also make it your job, how fun is that! Without music a lot of people would lose their hobby and their passion. Music is also a big economical thing because a lot of money is put in the music industry so that is also an important thing about music. So what I think is that music is important for our lives and our mental health.

Lying is considered a sin in many clutures and religions, and I believe it is a sin too, but each rule has an exceptions, therefore, there are some specific situations, in which, lying would be a viable option. The first situation is in war. Imagine yourself taken a hostage by your country's enemies during war time, and they investigaed you, and asked you to tell them about your country's weapons, numbers of soldiers, and secret matters. It is a foregone conclusion that telling the truth here is wrong, it is deemed as betrayal. The second situation would be in marriage, and I do not want to be on the wrong foot here. Thus, I do not mean big or twisted lies, like cheating and lying about it. Instead, I mean small lies which would make her happy. For instance, if your wife was not attractive during pregnency, and she porbably will not, it would be really wrong to tell the truth to her face, even if she asked. Lying in these kinds of situations is also crucial, because the truth will not be beneficial for anyone. instead it will hurt her feelings and make her feel less confident about herself and her body. In my book, I believe that these two situations are the only ones that the person should lie in. Other than that, it is wrong.

There have been some rumours about a legislation to ban the use of moblie phones in public transport, shops, and restaurant, basically, any closed public place. I am writing you today to express my thoughts about the matter, and to give you some suggestions. I believe that your idea is good, but it is a little bit exterme, and it is not a viable option. It is true that individuals are using their moblie phones non-stop theses days, and it is also true that this excessive use is causing a lot of issues and accidents, but banning them that way is going to cause another problem, because someone may need to use his or her phone for an emergency, thus, the complete ban is not the best solution. However, we can all agree that the use of social media in public places is not necessary most of the time, same logic applies to games. Therefore, we should ban these kinds of apps, which are not helpful at all. In this way we can have a suitable solution, which is not so radical. At the same time that we achieve the desired outcome. I really want to thank you for giving me the time to read my suggestion. I hope that it was helpful for you. and I think that you are doing a great job.

This essay involves a delicate issue that I have been thinking a lot before answering, after having hear the other people's experiences. It seems a very easy issue and I doubt that people would prefer being rich but in a bad state of health. What I mean is that being healthy should be our main priority and all of us should take care ont only our personal state of health but should think also others health. Being rich and wealthy is not so important as many people think, and all the cases of rich people s illness, is a clue that make a lot of money does not think you are happy. What people do not understand is that they should not push their luck, becasue they run the risk of losing what is the most precious thing: their health. It is true that people have not control of what life bring them, but they cannot spend all their life looking for richness and wealth, we know very well how we risk down on our luck. If our destiny is to be rich and wealthy, we must just let nature take its course.

From the beginning of time people have tried to somehow find a way to elongate their life span. Things such as the philosopher's stone and witchcraft were invented for this reason. Even nowadays people dream of living over 100 years but is it really worth it? In my opinion, living a short but much more intense life can easily compensate for those 100 years of calm as it is believed that you need to live your life to the fullest. While being aware that your time on this earth is limited, you feel the need to cherish every moment. Having a short life reminds you that moments such as birthdays or celebrations need to be remembered and cherished properly. Secondly, living for 100 years could not only get tiring but also lonely. Having to see all your loved ones pass away can break your heart. The calm could come in handy when you're old but while you're at the peak of your youth, the need for calm goes away quite quickly. For example, a 20 year old regards the calm as a need only during weekends while for a 60 year old person, calm can be crucial to their everyday life. To conclude, the sweet but short moments you live in a shorter life can be more fulfilling than when you live a longer but more calm life. The intensity of the shorter life is always more welcome than the boredom and repetitiveness of a longer life span.

Dear participants to the town council, I would like to express my opinion regarding the last idea about banning the use of cell phones in common areas such as restaurants and shops, as well as public transport. I am actually aware of the environmental as well as biological risks of the pollution due to electromagnetic waves, and the very kittle worry of the people about that. First of all because people do not 'feel' the electromagnetic waves, in the sense that it is a pollution that doesn't make noise, or bad smelling, nor even is 'seen' as wasted material. Nevertheless, it is with no doubt acting on our ears warming, as the cell phone electromagnetic waves are of the same kind of the microwave, thus enabling our water molecules to 'twist', producing warming as a secondary effect. Unfortunately this kind of molecular movement is sometimes creating headaches or even tumors (most of the times benign). Especially in young people, as they are made of much more water than adults. For all these reasons I would agree with the council's initiative, for the 'precautionary principle' that would induce us not to use intensively cell phones before a clear scientific statistics is made by our healthy organization. Anyway, before taking such a decision, I would suggest to take initiatives in order to make people discuss with competent doctors about the problem. In fact I think that you need first of all to give the knowledge, than you can convince people to accept the rule.

Currently, few high schools presume students to prove a voluntary work to graduate. But does that just throw their time or does it promote the personality development of its students? Firstly, undeniably most students experience schools as too theoretical rather than practical. It seems to them that they learn something with low impact for their future. Or do you have to acquire broadening skills - think about arts or sports - for applying to a maths degree? Therefore, volunteers could gain real-life experience, which would top the dry school material off. Additionally, students had to choose from a range of voluntary work that suits their interests best and learn essential life lessons such as communicating with others or being empathetic. Lastly and not less relevant is that students with a voluntary background set themselves out from other peers. This enables them to gain benefits in an application process for the university or a job. To sum up I think that more schools should assume students to conduct work voluntarily. On the one hand, this would broaden the horizon of the students academically and on the other hand personally.

These paragraphs contain the question whether university students should live on their own while they are attending school or whether they should live at home. I personally think that it is less laborious to stuy at home, because you do not need to look for another affordable accommodation and you can spare your money due to a missing rent you do not need to pay. To sum up this is a great choice if your degree course is taught at your home university. Despite that it is obvious that some prospective student moves away because of their interest in a specificed study field. Furthermore, you will mature quicker by managing your own life, that covers the daily shopping in a supermarket or to arrange a doctor's appointment, and you will feel more confident suczessive. Moreover it could be beneficial to study even abroad in order to learn a foreign language and to represent you as person with international attributes. That would eases your job search after graduation enormally, if you would prefer to study in an international working environment.

Since a well-known magazine for English language learners has asked for reviews about useful resources for learning English I recommend Write & Improve with Cambridge whose function is to improve your writing skills step by step. If you open this writing tool, you can choose between various tasks which require a different level of English. After that, you start to write a text and hand it in after you finished. Subsequently, a review of your written text emerges and you can see what you have done correctly and where you can improve. Now you are correcting your mistakes and hand in your revised text to check whether it is right. On the one hand, this method requires a highly responsible and motivated student who seeks his mistakes over a long time, but on the other hand, it can be extremely unsatisfactory when you do not fix some mistakes. Although this tool is a good way to self-study, it is even better with someone's help in fixing some mistakes. In my view, every English student should use this tool or a similar for enhancing his writing skills. In more particular you can learn at your speed and focus on your developing fields. Nevertheless, it can be frustrating to seek mistakes for a long time, but then you need to go on.

People around the world plan their life differently based on their wishes. Two possible life plans that I feel deserve to mention are to live a long calm life or a short intense life. Firstly, everybody must live as long as possible to be able of fulfilling every wish. Referring to this, it is out of doubt that a long life suits best this life goal because the elderly spend more time on Earth and can look back at a long life span. If anyone pursues to reach that, he needs to live healthily and to stand out of any danger. Another life plan is to act less calmly and to do more exciting as well as dangerous things. Moreover, they wish to do more dangerous activities because of the adrenaline rush. In more particular, some people feel more vital during these nastier situations and can relax from the monotony of their routine life. In addition, these people think that they should do anything that they want before they get too old to do it. I think that a more calm life would correspond to my expectations way better. In more detail, I am not a person that seeks exciting situations and I feel more comfortable in a structured daily routine. But most important is that I want to live as long as possible because I have several plans for my future.

Young people and sports Should be sport obligatory for young people? Many would argue that not. Others could see this from different perspective. Let's try to take a look at both opinions. According to statistics every fifth child is overweight in the UK schools. " Just sport more and eat less" could some people say. But it's not that simple. It's not easy to "just sport." Young people can be disgussed by sport because of their early childhood memories. For example Harry was forced to do at least five sport activities a week, and none was interesting, nor enjoyable, for him. Because of this now, when he can take some responsibility into his hands, he doen't do any sport, because he thinks all of them are alike. On the other hand there are people like Sarah, who are finding their passion in the early childhood. Nowadays she is basketball player in national league, playing at least five times a week. Although she was not forced to choose exceptionally this sport, it has been found thanks to PE in school, where sports were changing almost every lesson. This had fortunately led to her outstanding success. Without a doubt is she role model for many young ones. To summarize, this question is not as easy to answer as it may seem. Seldom do we see as ambitious young people as Sarah. But still her story tells us something. She could've tried all the sport in her childhood and nobody was forcing her to do any of them. Therefore she is sporting until now without planning to stop. Other people don't have to be as active as her but finding any hobby in sports helps them in their healthy lifestyle. All in all, I'm certaint that young people should try as much sport as possible, but forcing them to do what they don't like won't help the cause.

In my opinion, music has an important role in everyone's life. First of all, there are several kinds of music, and each one can have a different impact on your mind. For example, there are some songs which are made for sensitizing people, whereas other ones are made in order to lift the mood. Another key point to remember is that a particular song can be part of a special moment of someone's life; therefore, that song has a special meaning for that person. Some researches stated that a song can really change a life; for instance, it has proved that it can really help a person get out of a state of depression. In sum, life without music would not be as great as it is, since the rhythm and lyrics can really have a huge impact on people's mind.

Music is definitely important for humankind. It indicates how our lives are going on from the past to present. Human has learned human being through music and its lyrics ,forexample politics, religion, culture and love. Music is one of the crucial parts of our lives so it plays an important role to alleviate people feeling when they encounter tough situations. In addition, it encourages people to show their true feeing in terms of affliction or political issues. This is the reason why that life cannot live without music. If there was not music in our lives, life woulnd not have gorgeous moments and people did have imagination or creavitity to create magnificent lyrics or songs. As a result, it is doubtless that knowledge or riligious teaching are difficult to convey to people. From my view, decisively, I cannot live without music because music always soothes my temper when I feel frustrated from my problems. Moreover, it helps me to have more concentration while I am working or reading books.

Although many people think about the school in the past was better than today, I believe the needs of the people through time are different and the manner to teach people must be different. For this reason the school of the future will be more connected and more human. Access to information will increase rapidly and the teacher role will need to be more interactive and based of the reflection to help students to think. This last point will be crucial because the huge amount of information bombarding people in their daily life must choose and selected to do the best choice in your private or professional life. The school must teach psychology and a collectif sport like balance of your life. The teachers must become as a coach to prepare their students to fight again their own thoughts and to be benevolent with their colleagues, teacher, parents. Therefore the future school must be must be based more on the know how to be than to know do.

I firlmy believe that you should always tell the truth or at least do no lie. It is one of the rules from Jordan Peterson's book and I had been acting upon it for a while with great results in my mental health. Of course that you can't push it to the extremes. You shouldn't ingore the purpose of the white lies. I still believe that children should believe that they are recieveing christmast presents from a little jesus and that if they misbehaved they will be taken by a devil. There is a complicated dichotomy in case of leadership. Your people deserve the truth but on the other hand they should be spare of some deeds of your own boss. It is about a morale of the team. An extreme example may be on a sea. Sailors in the middle of the ocean on their transatlanit voyage with not enough of food. Should the sailors be informed about the siuation or should it be kepts secret. Is the threat of a mutiny less important then the truth. The only hope of survive is to proceed on and hold on with maximum effort. To tell the truth is the opposide. So this is example when the proper solution is not telling the truth but simply to be quiet and with that not telling the lie.

Although many people think TV is only recreation activities, I am convinced that TV can also learn a lot of things. Because there are many TV shows with différents subjects like science, religion, literature, nature... you have opportunities to better known these themes and to be able to talk about them. These tv shows can be the basics of study in the school or university and at less the first step to raise interest of a subject. With the development of TV Channels, TV is also an open mind on the foreign and linguistic culture. For the children, that is a convenient manner to learn a foreign language when they watch movies or other TV show. Proof on that, in the north of Europe where English TV Channel are better developed than the south of Europe, people speak and write fluent English than the south people.

Music is a way of expression, and can influence in people mood experimenting different senses. Without music, people would not have a filter to express and share their feelings and thoughts in peace because music allows people show personal sides of them. Music is important because it can determine the mood in place or the formality of an event because depending on the music played, people can behave in one way or another. Music open a wide way of opportunities of experiencing new sensations in different places and knowing people with different manners. For example, it is not the same the behaviour in a concert to the behaviour in opera. Music allows people to experiment those kinds of feelings and environments from their different music styles, and the best part, it is not necessary to be an expert. Life without music would not allow people create and find a place of expression, and they could not develop their creativity. To conlcude, music is one of the best resources of people's expression.

In mz opinion, it has imperative. As we see, the more life modern, the more person lazy. And that is negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, particularly many people don't intend to change their lifestyle unless it comes to limitattion. Therefore, I think all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Because it has many benefits to them. Sports activities have great of important to your life. It helps you more healthy than before you do that, drop pressure, suffer from less various health problem. Suppose that you worked continual 5 days, I dare say that you feel tired. And then some people will reward yourself a cup of tea or a cup of coffee. But they don´ that it has negative effect on your health like lost memory, dark eyes, etc although it helps you to conscious for a short time. Instead of using it, you should do exercise. Because it has more benefit than drink tea or coffee such as more alert, flexibility, increase performance or so on. Sometimes, doing sports make our create ideals. Scientists research that person who always do exercise rarely less from health problem than lazy person. Why do students or children should do exercise 3 times per week? Simply, children have to learn many subjects and under pressure from their parents, their teacher or even their classmates. Therefore, they need do it to drop them, stretch their body, relax their face, etc. In other hand, it makes students to create healthy habits, and then enjoy their lifestyle, find smiles after the stressful class time In conclusion, sports activities have important to our lifestyle. Scientists research that people love sport always love yourself then the others and they also suffer from various problem involve to healthy too much.

In my opinion I think that medical doctors need other colleagues to do their job as well as they need the best equipment as possible. Another reason that's medical doctors want a different kind of services to live. Whereas, this service in rural areas are enough for them. At rural areas live few people than cities, accordind to the experts that's most that you need a doctor in the city against in the rural areas. In think for solving this problem more people would be to live in the village and they have more services and to improve their equipment. Even if rural areas is far from cities that's not a problem, because they can have one doctor for almost a hundred citiziens. To sum up, the best solution that's to increase the population of the rural areas will do that more doctors want to live in these area, therefore this problem will change in the future. Always people choose live at cities but with the pandemic situation most of them have come back to the small towns.

No matter how cool it is, I love it. Besides, both my birthday and Christmas are in winter. So I usually get many presents and this is one of the reasons why I love winter very much. Moreover, I always go hiking with my friends in winter. As we all get Christmas holiday, I can meet with all of my friends including other towns.

Most of medical doctors want to work where they will make much more mondey. Why is that? What a naive question. Of course they want to work in the cities. They want the money and the patients. It is something different to care about a farmer who works long days and nights in fields then about your client who is a city office worker. The question of how to solve this is the proper one. I think that for some medical doctors the money are more important then the work and for others it is vice versa. So we have to focus on those who prefer money in front of easy work. On those doctors we can focus our attention by benefits based on working out of the ccapital. Of course this wouldn't solve the problem onlty the symptoms. On the other hand I am from the Czechia and to be honest this problem is not really important for us. The employers are obliged to pay for healtinsurence for all his employees and it is free for those who are not working.

Even though it is one of the most searched and studied subjects, we can never know what is going to happen in the future, we can predict, but we can never be sure about it. Although it is unknown, people try to plan their future, and every one of us have his own preferences. Some people feel that it would be better to to live a long calm life while others consider a short intense life to be more appealing, so what is better? It is the kind of question where there is not right or wrong. If you asked me, I would not have a definite answer. Both of the choices are tempting, and have its own advantages and disadvantgaes. The first choice is tempting because it is a satisfying kind of life, you study, graduate, marry, have kids, then you probably see them entering the same cycle that you were in it, except for some minor changes. Maybe it seems boring, but it is nice to be able to live calmly, and get old while watching your grandkids play and have fun. The second choice is a nice one as well, because you just live twenty or thirty years, and do the things that you love, then die calmly after acheiving your goals. I believe that I would choose a mix of those two, even though I cannot really choose anything.

In my opinion that's a shame that they must complete a volunteer work in order to graduate.

I believe that young people today they throw away a lot of time doing anything. All the day they are conecting on smartphones or playing games instead they could to help other people or making something for the community. I hope in the future young people think that spend their time. Because it is more useful to help other people than to stay connect during hours on the Internet.

Health is important for human life. Do exercise it's one the most important things for a happy and healthy living. But there are also other important things, such as a good diet for example. I, sadly, am not an atheltic girl, but I try to keep in shape. I go running every day, weather permitting. I used to run and walk one hour a day. workout is not enough to keep body healthy, try eating only health food is also important. eating healthy means eating as much as possible egetables and fruits and delay all junk food and soft drinks, causing obesity and in extreme cases death. Going to gym may help weight-loss but it is also an economical way to reduce stress just because doing workout several times a week can improves blood flow and regain energy and calm maybe after a bad day at work.

If we want analying the percentuage of educative programs in a daily TV schedule, we observe that there aren't. documentaries or science programs can involve young people watching television to learn something. Every year on TV, there are more and more cooking shows. They can be useful for learning some new recipes. In short, TV schedules ought to air more documentaries and cultural programs. Another opportunity is showing new films, and not always black and white films. TV schedules can also air reality TV, but not like this.

In my opinion I think it's better move away during your university time. If you move out your home, I'm sure that those students will improve more than the students are with their families at home. The reason is that you must make your own meal and to go to the shopping every week, whereas the other students all thins things are made for your parents. The responsibility that one student needs far away his home is bigger than the other group of students. On the other hand, studying time is different when your are living out your home, because you need to be more organized.

I disagree that computers and tablets replace books in schools and universities. I know that computers and tablets are very convenient and aren't bulkier than books. However, students should use books because they can check the pages bother them quickly. In addition, we can marke a colour directly pages and take notes in pages of books directly. Currently, computers and tablets may do same things, but we can't erase completely what you write in books and the books get dirty which makes some people confident because we can see study records.

Dear members of the City Council, With this letter I would like to remind you of our constitution. According to Article Two of our Basic Law, every person has the right to act as he or she wishes. Therefore, your plan to ban cell phones on public transportation, in stores, and in restaurants is unlawful unless you can show good cause. Restrictions on our right to act as we wish are only possible if you have a good reason for doing so. However, you have not given such a reason, nor have you explained why you want to ban cell phones in the places already mentioned. As far as I can tell, there is no danger from the activities you intend to ban. Nor can I see any other good reason to enforce your idea. I can only assume that you are looking to patronize your citizens. It seems to me to be an idea aimed at preventing people from using cell phones in situations where a well-behaved person would not use these devices. However, while this cause is understandable, it is an impermissible restriction on our constitutional rights. Social norms should never be imposed on people by law. In the long run, such overregulation will lead to dissatisfied citizens and unrest. Therefore, I believe that you should refrain from your idea of regulating the use of cell phones in public transportation, restaurants or stores.

The reasons for many doctors choose the big city is because they will receive more money and there are more doctors in the place, so it's more difficult pass to work in a hospital localizated in a big city.

A far as I am concerned, none of the reasons we have been presented with were supported by any scientific evidence. Therefore, I am demanding the town Council to present the public with their backed up by science arguments. Moreover, neither I nor anyone in my family had been ever approached and asked to give our own opinion about the topic. Should not be our local representatives more in touch with their people when it comes to making such drastic changes in our lives? Do you think, this is the right way to treat your citizens? Well, I must strongly disagree with you, then. And finally, to sum it up, I would like to propose organizing another meeting where everyone who might be affected by those changes was able to express their views.

MY NEW SCHOOL YEAR The fundamental purpose of this report is no other to get to plan my new English school year by specifying the most important objectives I would like to achieve once this season comes to an end. Let us straight to the point and tackle the heart of the matter. The areas of my learning I am pleased with the most: It is fair to draw attention to the fact that learning English is a need for everybody nowadays beyond doubt whatsoever. When it comes to studying English I cannot help but say that my most highlighted strength is no other than my writing skills, and so I want it to continue being this way. In that spirit, my intention is to keep on exercising it. The areas of my learning I want to improve: With regard to my weaknesses, not only do I find it difficult to express myself speaking English but also I am aware of my difficulties to understand some different accents such as it is the case of Irish or Scottish one. Should there be any way which contributes to making it easier for me to understand them, I would be delighted to explore it. It is crystal clear that being able to understand all the English accents is what strikes people the most. Achieving my goals: It goes without saying that once I overcome my drawbacks concerning the usage of English language, I will be more confident when using that language whenever I find it appropriate and it will also encourage me more to continue studying it for good, as we never stop learning. I am well aware of my needs to deepen in my weakest points of learning, and, by doing so, I will surely overcome my flaws. In a nutshell, I would like to conclude by pointing out that by performing all of what I mentioned above, I will manage to improve my English level rapidly.

In the last decades, the health of students has started to decline. An inactive lifestyle, accelerated by the negative impacts of video games and streaming platforms, has resulted in higher obesity rates. One burning question has emerged: Should we force school children and even university students to participate in sports activities at least three times per week? This essay intends to make it abundantly clear that strict regulation is not a solution at all. There can be no doubt that the physical state of myriads of children has worsen due to the rise of globalization and digitisation. With thousands and thousands of children addicted to video games and social media, the allure of going outside is comparatively small. This has certainly changed over time. The leisure time our parents and grandparents spent in their childhood seems to be worlds apart from ours. Few people would dispute the fact that exploring the wild is not an integral part of growing up. There are those who argue that kids should not be put in a risky situation. Helicopter parents are instantly watching every single step of their beloved offspring. However, in that way they are indirectly hindering their child's development. Kids need to spend time outside. It is widely believed that children need to make decisions on their own to make independent decisions which thus enhances personality development. The proposal of forcing children to do sport activities is quite similar to the approach of the autocratic regime in China. In order to counteract the "feminisation" of society which refers to the up-bringing of a generation full of spoiled only childs, the government has implemented a sport scheme. However, we - as members of a democratic society - should set a good example. In conclusion, children should not be forced to do sports involuntarily. These initiatives would not improve the situation overall. We have to counteract these recent developments by supporting children to use their smartphones all the time and instead take a walk outside. All our problems would diminish within a second.

Dear town council, I am writing in reference to your idea to forbid the use of mobile phones in the public. I disagree with your opinion and will state out my arguments with the help of examples. Firstly, mobile phones are used by the most people for keeping in touch with each other, for working activities outside the office and to inform yourself about the daily news. You will probably reply to this in the following way: Everybody is distracted, because there is so much activity in their mobile phones, and the social communication decreases in the public. Thus, new technologies, like mobile phones, computers or headphones, to name just a few, are part of our today's culture and too relevant to ban them. Furthermore, you forget another important aspect: social network's use increases and that especially among younger people. Whose advantage is that people across the world - even in the most distance between each other - can interact with each other. It is known by the most that this is a relevant factor to globalisation, which enables us to act together the first time in human history. But the winning argument is that the use of mobile phones spare much time. If you needed to search for an information for ages, you would get a result in a much shorter time span now. Time that could be used to go outside or to do engage voluntarily. Therefore I strongly recommend declining your idea of banning mobile phones in the public, Yours Sincerely, Jan

I knew that someone need music in their lives. While, I also think that not all people need music in our life. First of all, music is not only a way to make life better. For example, my hobby is running. Thus, when I have time or need to feel relaxed, I usually go to a gym and running by using treadmill. While, I don't listen to music if I have time. In addition, my husband also have other hobbyies other than music. He is a person who feel happy when he makes new programs. Additionally, music is not necessarily for all to live a life. There are many essential things for our life such as sleep and foods. However, we can live a life without music. In fact, long long time ago, people lived a life without music.

Living an unhealthy lifestyle leads to unhealthy people and being inactive is a main reason for health issues. Nevertheless, should we really force university students and school children to do sports activities three times a week? Nowadays, students are already stressed out at school and university and often while writing exams there is not much free time left to include sports in the daily life. It would be really stressful for some students to start forcing them to do sports because it does not fit in their life. When forced to do something the activity becomes less fun and ca sometimes not be enjoyed which leads to demotivation. Furthermore, what would the consequences be if someone does not do sports activities three times a week? I think it would be unfair to punish someone because they were studying instead of working out. On the other hand, sport is great to help with physical issues and mental health problems and considering the current state some of the students and children are in physically and mentally sport activities would be a great way to help them out and to decrease obestity and depression. On the whole, sports activities are excellent to create a work life balance which is often missed by a lot of students, especially when they study a lot. In addition, to stay healthy in the future you need some sort of activity during the week if you do not want to become ill when you are old. In recent years an amount of obese children has increased which is also caused by a lack of movement because today most children play video games which is why motivating them to do more activities would be a good idea. Last but not least, if one found the right sports activity it is often a lot of fun and afterwards you are more likely to be happy because your body sends out endorphines. In conclusion, I think forcing students and children to do sports activities three times a week is not the right way, but to change something is necessary. Sport needs to be more integrated in school and university which would also make it more comfortable for students to integrate sport in their everyday life. For example, there could be more sport lessons in school, more free activities and maybe a whole new subject concerning a healthy lifestyle. In college taking part in a sports course could be obligatory and there could also be more options. Often, at least as problematic as the lack of movement are the eating habits some folks have which is why working on that would also be a great improvement of young people´s health and providing a subject in school about it would be the best way to do it. Still, the sports activities should be fun and not forced but it is important to consider making it obligatory and including it more in school and university.

In my opinion, all of us do need music in our lives. The music can be important in a lot of different situations with different goals. For instance, some humans are used to listening to music in public transport. In this case, that's entertainment and the music makes the way shorter. For other people, that's a way to put some words on their thoughts, and to express them, whether joy, sadness or any feeling which the music highlights. That can also be used to celebrate, in clubs or in events more intimate like a party between friends. We definitely can see that the music has a lot of different utilisations. Personally, I can't even imagine life without music. Evidently, I know that some people don't need to listen to music daily and feel very well with that. But globally, the music is one of the seven major arts which relies the humans and their culture between them.

Dear town council, I received the information about your idea of banning mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. You are willing to hear our opinion regarding that statement, so here you will hear mine considering different aspects. Given that, banning mobile phones in public spaces would be such a positive impact in relation to human capibility of socializing with each other. Especially in public transportation, why do I think that? Well, nowadays everybody who is travelling alone spends most of their time looking at their screen or are listening to music in order to avoid conversation with anybody around. Its appalling to see how addicted we are to our technological devices, with this idea in mind we could undoubtedly see a change in our behaviour within short a time But if we think about it, banning mobile phones can be an outstanding concept for extroverts, which are likely to begin a conversation with others. Nonetheless for introverts it could sound as the most dreadful idea, some already find it terrifiying getting on public transportation but they are able to accomplish it thanks to the phone. On the other hand, banning mobile phones in restaurants will be easier to implement owing to the fact that most of the time you go accompanied. It goes without saying that reducing time on our phones will not only make us realize how nice it is to have a simple conversation with a stranger but also remember how life was before technology. I hope to hear from you soon. Laura Manuela

TV is undoubtedly the way that has put together the different parts of our society, and it has made people more consciuos about the world in which we live. The Tv texture is the same since it has apperared over five or six decades ago. This structure has been criticised a lot, because many people have dubts about the truth that TV says us. TV should entertain the audience and all those people that watch it for example when they are having lunch and dinner. This is the reason why it is easy to watch some programmes like "talk show" and "quiz show" where the guests are invited to tell their opinions. The power of the tv education is something that has been already discussed over the last decades by well-educated opinionists, and as I see it, TV can be useful to educate the always wider audience that follow its programmes. However, we must point out that the relevance of TV does not depends on only the subect, but also from the manners and education of the opinionists. The most important thing, is to pay attention to the cultural level of the opininists, irrespective the subjects treated.

Although people think paper books won't be replaced by ebook, I believe readers will be sharing between both of them. Because that is two different experiences. Book is pleasure to touch the paper and feel is grain and its smell. A ebook is very practical, you can bring with you more than thousand books with you, you can copie and past expressions and sentences to make a presentation, you can show this book during a meeting ... that is very convenient and cheap. But there is also disadvantage. You need to have electricity when your battery is empty. You don't have all the books in digital. In fact when you are relax and your library, you like to look for books and take time see it. Often your eyes is less tired to read paper book. During this time you usually read a book but you are at your office you prefer to use digital ones because it is much practical. I think ebook must be easier for students to use for preparing lesson But when they will research any information from the past, the paper book will be unavoidable.

Are you musical? Have you ever thought about how important music is for most people worldwide? How often do they listen to it or why do they listen to it? There are many moments in life in which music is our unique companion. For example, when we travel by car. However, there are also many other situations when we enjoy music together with our friends, our family, or even unknown people at live events such as concerts. Music is important to help us pass time while we wait for something, to make the most of our free time, to cheer us up when we are a little bit down or to celebrate when we have a good reason. The sound we listen to and the lyrics of the songs have the power to change our mood, to make us feel lively and energetic or to calm us down. Personally, I can't imagine the world without music. It'd be like a forest with nothing but bare trees. There would be lack of rhythm to make the world go round.

In my opinion, studying music would be an obligation in all schools. I have this opinion because music is not only an art, but also a way to improve the brain's neuronal conexions.. In all around the world, there are studies which demonstrate this: psychologists, doctors, musicists and several other professionals get at these same results: Studying Musics is one of the best thing to raise the brain's capacity. Music also can help people to socialize. It is very difficult to find someone who does not like some kind of music. Whatever the style of music is, there is somebody singing. I imagine that music, in fact, is something really good to the brain and to the mind. Best of all is that... Music is not only a kind of art which almost everybody may to learn since kindness. Children almost always like music, singing it, hearing it, or simply appreciating it. That's for it I agree with the idea of apply music for all students, whatever be their level of learning at schools. In my city, almost scholls already introduced these essay in their classes. I am sure that it only have the goal of to improve several aspects of the students' lives. I had the happiness of learning Musics when I was a child. In my school, those classes began when I was 10 years old. Since I started stay involved with these essay, I never forget about how good it was for all my whole life! And since I discovered the amazing world of Musics, I never let it anymore! So, here goes my suggestion about these essay: Dear teachers, always all you can, teach Music to your pupils!

Most of the people work for the money. If there is a chance to have a higher income when doing the same things, then who will give it up? Nowadays, most medical doctors choose to work in cities rather than work in the rural areas which don’t have enough doctors. It is all because of the differences in incomes. As we can see, some people who live in the rural areas don’t have enough sources of medical. When they need to go to the doctors they have to go for a long distance, that is okay when it is not urgent. But what about the urgent times? We are not able to predict all the accidents, and many people died because they were not able to get their treatment immediately. With that much being said, what is the solution for this problem? Someone might say that governments can distribute more fees to the hospitals which operated in rural areas. But I think that does not make sense. the people who live there are absolutely not as many as those who live in the cities, if the government distribute more fees, it might not be fair to the others. Then what should we do? I think that we can improve the transportation there. By shortening the time they have to spend going to the hospitals, the chances that they can get treatment immediately will be higher. At the same time, people who live in the cities won’t feel unbalanced because they can use those transportation too. Apart from the medical problems, there are actually lots more problems in the rural areas like this, and I think our governments should face the problems or not just keep ignoring them. There are lots of solutions actually, and it only depends on whether the government wants to do it or not. The autorities definitely know these solutions, too, but they don’t care because solving these problems can not bring them much benefit. Even though reality is cruel, and it will take a long time for problems like these to be solved, we will continue to try our best in order to solve the problems.

No, I think it computers and taklets are not completely replace books in schools and universities. I think it quite easier to read in the book than in the computers and tablets especially when you do research and you need to read a lot of books in one time. In my university there are a lot of books that is very old, when I read this kind of book I think the hard cover version are better than digital version. The important point is if we need to replace the books by computers and tablets you need to give them for free. You can't tell them that they need to buy these and not give them money. That is why I think it hard to replace especially in this country. This country have no policy to do such things. If we still have dictatorship government then I can assure you that you don't have the day that education is the primary factor in this country.

My favourite season of the year is autumn. Autumn in Japan is the best season of food like sweet potetoes. Autumn is also the season of autumn leaves, which I think is the best season for sightseeing. I love to see the autumn leaves around Tokyo station. I think the autumn leaves lining the road from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace are wonderful. Every autumn, there is a lot of people to see them. Also the moon is big and shining and very beautiful! The weather is pleasant ,with around 20 degrees. The air is cool, but the wind is bracing, and the sky is blue. Spring in Japan has a similar climate to autumn . However, spring in Japan is a difficult season for hay fever sufferers because of the high levels of cedar pollen.. I wish that fall lasted longer, but in the past few years it has gotten shorter and shorter. If autumn is longer than now, I would go to travel.

Dear Ivan. My favorite film is Cast Away, with the actor Tom Hanks. I have three reasons. The first reason, is that love sometimes it's very strange, almost a tragedy. The second reason, we don’t know what the tide will bring us each day, that it’s true. The final reason, is maybe the most painful, we don’t know to accept the misadventure of life, is part of the suffering de human being and their life, but it’s necessary to know when we must accept that. I forgot to tell you, the music and landscape are beautiful. My favorite scene is when Hank made a bonfire. I recommend you should watch it.

To talk about the volunteer works that have to be done to graduate from some high schools, we have to figure out what is volunteer work first. In my opinion, volunteering is to work but not for the pay. Maybe for learning experiences or just because of their passion. No matter what sets off this decision, volunteering should be good for everyone. But actually, something goes wrong now. Volunteering should be done by people who want to do it. However, some schools set up rules that require students to go volunteering compulsorily. In that case, students do volunteer work with a completely different attitude. They are not really there to help any more, and they just want to finish their jobs as fast as they can. Undoubtedly, the most of the quality of their work will not be good as we expected. It is a difficult problem to solve. If we change the compulsory rules with rewards, the quality will not get higher because most of the students will still finish their work at the lowest requirement. And if we make the lowest requirement higher, their parents will start to argue that it takes too much of their time doing these meaningless things so that their kids cannot study well. The best way I think to solve this problem is to cancel the rule that requires students to go volunteering. The students who really want to help will still go by themselves and the others who don’t have that kind of passion will not have to waste their time. There are lots of things that cannot be done well by setting up rules. Many factors have to be considered, whether psychological or not. All is all, this is my opinion towards volunteer work.

Motivating children to do regular exercise Today's biggest challenge is in child education and parenting: how to motivate children to do regular exercise? In recent years, the number of doctors reporting children with health problems such as obesity has skyrocketed. The number of young people taking up sport is also ever decreasing. So, schools should provide their students to take sport classes, three times a week. Firstly, parents most of the time are not able to bring their offspring to the soccer club or tennis club. They are too busy with their work and come home after diner has already been served. Undoubtedly, schools are the perfect solution for this, their students could simply stay at school for three extra hours a week and take sport classes. This will help enable children to exercise regularly. Furthermore, it will not cost any extra effort from school or the parents; The students were already on school, so they do not have to be brought or something. Secondly, as already mentioned in the introduction. There is an increasing number of teenagers who suffer from health problems, because of their lack of exercise. They may not be motivated or empowered by their parents, but this is the part where college comes into play. As with the first argument, schools simply need to coerce and motivate their students. This can easily be done by providing their students to be able to take gymnastic classes three times a week. In conclusion, schools should enable their students to participate in sports activities, since there is an ever increasing amount of young people who suffer from health issues, because they do to less sport. Furthermore, not every child is able to do exercise reguarly. Schools could easily help these young people by providing their students to take sports lessons three times a week. Students should not be stupid and doop it.

As a current pediathran who look after the health of all the kids, I couldn't agree more. During this lately years junk food and gummies have became the most crucial food for kids, and because of the certain amount of restaurants of fast food, this habit of eating unhealthy food has became more bigger. Now that there's more technology that sorround us and that a lot of kids are into video games all the time, the best we can do for children is put sports activities at least 3 times per week, 'cause if they keep having an inactive lifestyle and still eating junk food, the amount of problems and illines they can have in the present or carry to the future are extensive. I think that the fathers of this kids are not very conscious about the type of life are living their kids with such a bad habits of health and food. If the parents are worried about their children, they can do some things to avoid the problems that a younger kid can get a heart problem once he's older. Some of the things that I recommend is put the kid in an extracurricular sport, or if you have the opportunity to do a sport that you can do at school after classes you could choose that option. Doing an extracurricular sport helps the kid to have a more active lifestyle - in addition of the sports activities 3 times per week - and to become more healthy. Although we want children to start having a more active lifestyle, I would also recommend for them to change the type of food they're constantly eating and that aren't healthy for their body. Food as juice that has a lot of preservatives and sugar, chocolate that is in almost every cookie you find, etc.

Music is a way to promote ideas, to send messages, to become falling in love and to figth against enemies. In my life, music plays a fundamental role. I usually listen to the music when I feel alone. Music is a companion of my magic moments. Several songs have a special meaning for me. when I hear that songs, I live again in my mind special moments of my life. Music is an opportunity to meet peolpe and to have new friends. Nothing is special as attending a live concert. A life without music would be the same as a life without colours. My favourite music is dance music and hip-hop. My mother likes lyric music and my father likes rock music.

Based on some TV programs, social media and other kinds of entertainments, you should pursue the idea of living an intense life as the most ideal option even when this is something harmful to our own bodies or to other people feelings. They say it's your obligation to give yourself the best of this world and all its pleasures as well. On the other hand, living a long and calm life is sold as something boring, old-fashioned and even meaningless, which is not the case at all but, as a marketing product that doesn't receive enough attention, this kind of lifestyle seems not good or even wrong. That said, it is clear there is a kind of bias on our platforms of entertainment, aiming to something that can be money, blindness and other shadowed goals. Personally, I prefer to live a long and calm life rather than an intense and short life because time is something highly precious for me and I do not want to waste it filling emotional needs but, achieving meaningful goals. Aiming to explain in detail those meaningful goals, I'll be more specific now. They are: raising my children with love for the Lord Jesus, learning more and more about Him and consequently improving my personal features. I know that some of those last mentioned are not good and that's why I want to improve them.

My favourite season of the year I do not have a favourite season, I like all four seasons. But it is true that we can enjoy each season in a different way, taking enjoyable activities, both indoor and outdoors. When it comes having fun I am very sure that summer is the best season. People can go outside without being afraid of bad weather, storns or facing a pouring raining. There are plenty of activities available such as playing sports, camping, getting a walk or even swimming in a river or lake. Being associeted to a country club could be a great idea if you have a hot summer season in your region. Summer season is also nice because we can keep in touch with nature. It is a nice time to have ice cream, juices and tropical fruits such as banana, papaya, melon and a cold watermelon, that is such a delicious fruit. However, all seasons have pros and cons, but there are a lot of possibilities to explore and always is possible getting the best of each one.

Human always keep developing every second, that's our instinct that since our ancestry's era, we've already possessed that feature. Our ancestry have an intense life because that's survival instinct, they have to forage, find place to sleep and hunt or would be hunted. Today, some people presume that we don't need to do so anymore as we've had everything we need already (foods, stable accomodation and even places to entertain) but I don't think so. We're human and human always want more in a positive way. Personally, it's not wrong as curiosity is good, learning new things is good,.. I love an intense life more than anything else. That's why if you ask me, I will definitely choose a shorter but much more intense life rather than a long, calm one until 100 years old. As I have said, keep moving forward is our instinct, I believe that's a special feature God creates speacially for humans. Furthermore, I love the intensity of our life, I always think it's the gift which life gives to us. Every time I come up against a challenge or sticky situation, maybe I would feel sad or some other negative feelings at first, but after that I know it was a positive experience and felt very proud of myself. After all, challenges help us grow, I learn a lot from those hard moments. In summary, I couldn't live even a day with a life that is so calm or monotonous, every day is the same, I prefer an intense but short one.

Life choices In modern society, people can easily live to 100 if they live healthily lives, but most people do not live until they are 100 years old, which means they have chosen not to live wholesome all the time. Understandably, it is not possible to always think about the future. Firstly, humans are animals, thus they are not so able to think of their happiness in the future, but of their present peace of mind. So, people are not not always able to take bright decisions and there is nothing wrong with that as long as they enjoy their lives. I would rather have a short pleasant life in which I had a lot of fun with than a long dull life and live to 100. Secondly, looking back to the first argument, nobody will get happy about living a long wholesome live without any pleasure. Everybody rather has a shorter live in which they have enjoyed life and they can say: "Wow my life was awesome man, I do not regret anything." Instead of having a dreary live and they will say: "Well if I had walked 10 more steps ervery day, this would not have happened" In conclusion, I rather have a short, but joyful life than a long but drab life. Since I will be able to look back at my life on my deathbed and think, wow what an amazing life I had.

Although I do not like its grammar and the different way to make the structure sentences, I must aknowledge that English is an interesting language and it is useful to reinforce our ability in thinking in an alternative way. As well, English has been singled out like the first language for international trade, and all those who take over the control of a company or a firm, have a deep knowledge of it.

Second, my favourite food is cold and sweet junk food, and it is best to eat cold food in hot weather that makes you swear. One more thing very special is I don't need to go to school in summer, which makes sense to all students! As I have a summer holiday, of course in summer, I can go swimming and eat ice cream.

If you asked me two years ago what's the meaning of music in my life, I certainly wouldn't give the importance that it deserves. Nowadays, two yeas later (and a Covid-19 pandemic in the middle of way), I can say that music has saved me. When the Covid-19 pandemic started, I needed to move back to living with my parents and keep locked inside our home for safe. It was a really difficult time for me, because I was gotten used to live alone and there was a lot fear in the air. This episode takes more than one year and I needed psychological help to keep me strong until the end. In several moments, the music was my only company and distraction. Because of this, I developed a rich taste for music, in particular for different musical styles around the world, such as reaggeton, pop culture, R&B, Indian music, etc. Now, I'm sure I can't live without music and I'm looking forward to the next Doja Cat album!

There are several reasons to explain the problem. And perhaps it can be very hard to find solutions to it. Why so many doctors prefer to work in cities where it is possible to earn much money? The answer: There are several reasons, and one can tell some of them: First: Those cities with many people are places where there are much more opportunities. If there are much possibilities, there will be much more money, too. Second: With more money in the pocket, it is possible to choose best conditions of life. And so, things became a circle. Third: Perhaps doctors want to work in the richest cities because there are more advanced technologies and research, and also more qualified people to work beside the Health's professionals. These are only some of the reasons I see that preference. But, what can we say about the real situation of those people who live in rural areas? In these places, there is not enough Medical professionals' area. So, why those doctors don't want to work there? Well, the poverty is a huge reality... the places where those people have to work are simple and small, and they almost don't receive enough research or support to continue doing their activities. In these smaller cities (or districts!), these or that doctor uses to be the only professional to work during the weekends. For consequence, great part of them work much more than they should. Perhaps for this reason many of them prefer to work in places next to great cities. How can it be solved? It is difficult to say that there is only one solution to solve this trouble. In true, there are several points to be analysed. It is necessary that those little cities' professionals earn better payments. And so, the Governments have to look with more attention to those people who don't live in the Capitals. It is also necessary to improve the structures and conditions of those work places. Perhaps after all these improvements, doctor can change their point of view and they want to change the largest cities for the calm from smallest villages!

Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? In my opinion yes, today is more important speak another language, especially English, than had a degree professional. It’s probably for many causes, for instance: a) the size of the American economy, b) the international relations between United States of America with the Commonwealth, c) Several free trade agreement or treaty subscribed with mane countries around the world. Another reason maybe it can be, the American culture, is fascinating how they captured the imagination of millions of people of thousands different cultures, through their music, television programs, movies, and video games. Of course, the globalization is a strong influence about the economic relationship between countries, but it depends on the leadership of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Of course, the leadership depends on the advanced technology and military forces.

Medical doctors and cities A great issue faced by many cities is the absence of health care staff, mostly medical doctors, in rural areas. This problem affects both underdeveloped and developed countries. Medical doctors do not want to live in the countryside. But why does it happen? Which leads to this situation in severeal countries, whether these countries are rich or poor. I guess there are several things that can influence on it. One of them is that when a highly qualified professional as a doctor lives in big cities they earn more money. In addition, doctors who live big cities can easily get educational updates such as MBAs, courses and conferences, which would not be possible if they lived lived in rural areas. Living in major cities can help these doctors make professionals connections and this is very important for their careers. Maybe they would not be able to get these opportunities if they lived in the countryside. Despite the difficult of setting medical doctors in the countryside, there are some possible strategies that towns can adopt in order to attract these professionals. One is to give them tax breaks to set up a new doctor's office. Another possibility is to offer advantages to newly graduated medical students. I saw an interesting alternative here in my country. Medical schools are being setting in medium size cities, known as regional centers, and it has been helping fix young doctors in those areas. Regional retention surveys have shown it is working.

Dear President of these Council: When it comes to improve the lives of all citizens, every decision is important and welcome. Your decision to ban the use of mobile phones in some places is excellent. However, I suggest only a changing when it comes to do it in some places, like shops and restaurants. I will explain why. Banning mobile phone in public transportation will be amazing! On the buses, trains or taxis, people need to respect passengers, and they have to maintain a pleasant place, in the maximum silence possible. Nobody would feel good if they are disturbed by who don't get speak low, don't want to do it, or prefer to listen to loud sound music. Banning mobile phones in this type of place is an excellent choose! In other hand, I ask you to reconsider your idea to ban them in shops or restaurants. Think about those people who are all the time working, and the cell phone is their main work tool! They are in permanent contact with clients and several other types of people. They almost always make their tasks during food, or when they go to a cafe, for example. If people get prohibited to use their mobile phones in restaurants or shops, they may have prejudice in their work... So, I suggest you to think better about the restrictions that this Council intend to apply for all citizens, if it's possible, of course. People will give me reason... And we believe that this our point of view, if can be accepted, will improve the lives of all people. Thanks for your attention.

It goes without saying that, when it comes to healthy living, there is a large number of things we can do to maintain it. My thoughts concerning that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would like to point out some paramount actions which should be accomplished by each and every individual who is willing to keep a healthy life. To begin with, drinking at the very least two liters of water every day is something pivotal if we want to get rid of the toxic particles. Another issue to have under consideration is the food we eat. I cannot help but mention that we all feel attracted by tasty food. Nevertheless, the meals we rate as tastier are not usually the ones that provide with the vitamins and characteristics appropriate. Fast food should be avoided as much as possible. Instead, we ought to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables in order to get fit. Nonetheless, we often find ourselves failing in the task of keeping fit, due to the fact that we do not usually count on the required time to fulfil that aim. Nowadays, we live in a deeply estressing world. Last but by no means least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that our body is our most valuable treasure, therefore, it is essential for us to put it in the first place.

Offices workspaces Currently, offices workspaces are a very important feature that can influence employee productivity and behavior. Choosing which design best suits the workplace is just as important as hiring the right person to do the job. Enclosed workstations can be very depressing and some people may view these cubicles as a threatening space that can betray their creativity. However, in the other hand an open design office should give to the employees an idea that they can do what they want anytime, but just in case they are not familiar with that design. Open design offices have been used in several industries and countries for many years and since it started, it has been working. Although it is very important that this kind of office be used in the right way. For example, it is a good idea to use an open design office for marketing, sales, advertising, or other informal business. But there are some industries where working in enclosed stations may be necessary, such as accounting offices, law firms and any areas where concentration and silent are an important requirement for work environment. Perhaps having these two options is such a good idea as it would meet the needs of employees in just one office. I guess it is very common today. Office buildings are being built with these two designs, whether employees need it, it will be available.

If I got to choose, I prefer a long, calm life over a short intensive life. Precondition is I still have friends to spend time with and I am healthy enough to live on my own. One of my greatest pleasures is to read books. I read for hours and imagine living other lives. On the outside it seems calm but, on the inside, I experience an adventure. In addition, I like to learn new skills. For some weeks I have practiced my coding skills. Learning a coding language demands long hours of training. To sum up, I need time in life to follow my interests. A short and intensive life, I imagine, is accompanied with fear of missing out on something. And intensity involves good and bad experiences. I prefer to learn certain lessons in life from books rather than experiencing them. In a short and intense life, I would always be on the run for the next exciting thing. A calm and long life although includes adventures but also more time for reflection. I like the change between lively and calm periods in my life. Yesterday I visited my sister and thinking about becoming a mother. It is a difficult decision since I cannot reverse it . Right now, I love my life as it is with my boyfriend and feeling loved.

Dear Town Council, I am a normal citizen in this town and I respect your opinion about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. But I have a reversal opinion about this law. I am a worker in this town for 10 years, I often have to go a long way to the work, so I think that I need to buy a phone for the necessary situation, but the security on public transport is very low and I must alert to pickpockets whenever I want to make a call. Therefore, I see calling by public mobile phones is a better choice, I can move to the place where there are driver and bus attendant, it is quite safe. Second, public mobile phones on transport and restaurant can support me in an emergency, I sometimes forget my phone at home and I cannot borrow other phones, so public mobile phones are my savior. Finally, the cost of public mobile phone's time is cheaper than private phones, so I can save some money for it. As a labor worker, I need to accumulate as much money as I can, because the company only hires young men under 40 and will fire all the old workers when they are not efficient. As you can see, I strongly protest your law. Although there are some problems with public mobile phones like installation fee for we must put the phone on many roads, and the nuisance of being bothered by children, we can solve it easily by encouraging people to use it more, and we can teach children not to do this, I think that is more beneficial than banning public phone. In conclusion, public mobile phones are convenient, safe, and economic than other choices. Sincerely, hang.

Chosing a University and a course to enroll is one of the most important decisions in life. Students have to decide it taking into consideration a lot of reasons, among them whether living on their own or with their parents. I personally believe that living by yourself is one of the best choices for a studente. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following paragraphs. To begin with, I think is crucial for students persuing their own independence in this period of life, for many times before college students are living in a comfort zone in their parents's house with food, housing, and clean clothes available. It can make them used to a lifestyle that is not real, and for that reason a period living alone far from home can be really helpful for their development. I am a compelling example of this, the best decision that I made in life was to leave my mother's house to go to college in another state. It helped to delevop skills and habits that are useful nowadays. Secondly, living alone provides an opportunity to connect with other people and build lifelong relationships. Moreover, it can also lead to building a powerful networking that will be important in a professional level in the future. For instance, when I was living alone in college I made a lot of good friends, they help me a lot with to pass through that new phase and become really close. Furthermore, for being with me everyday they became my second family and I can rely on them until this day which definitely come in hand in a personal and professional level. To conclude, I strongly believe that living on their own is good thing for students. It will help them to grow personally and to build great relationships.

I think music is necessary for everyone. Even if you do not like some styles, I bet that you have a song in your mind that helps or helped you somehow. When you are sad or happy, your playlist can tell, I am sure. And this is the thing, music has a great impact on our lives. The best romantic song was written because of someone, the person put all his feelings in a way to express how they felt. And, somehow, when we listen to that song, we think about someone too. Or at least feel something. But why? Because music carries more than lyrics, carries feelings. Another interesting thing, some studies reported the effects of music in neurological and mental diseases, showing that songs could affect our nervous system and memory. This is an amazing thing to for search more about diseases like Alzheimer and dementia. So, somehow, the songs that you like and listen to has a permanent effect in your brain, even though you think about music like a random way to pass the time. And because of that, I am sure that our lives would be harder without the feelings express through beautiful lyrics. It would be harder to charge ourselves with the beauty of melody and composition. Music makes us feel alive.

When talking about university life, the first thing we think of is being independent. Most of the students are of age and it is just the time to face problems by themselves. But, is moving away and living on their own a good choice? Here are some points. The most common problem is money, there has to be a place for university school students to live, and a place to live by oneself might cost a great amount of money. So where does the money come from? Some family can afford another expenditure like this, but what about the others that cannot afford? Of course the students can go get a part-time job, but since the college life is very busy, and I think it will affect their studying or socializing. As a result, getting a job while learning in school is just putting the cart before the horse. And another problem is about time. When we are on college, there are lots of things to do, no matter the studies or the clubs or the relationships. Those are all very important for the college students and will take a lot of time. So, do they actually have time to do all the housework and do some dishes? In my opinion, they have to learn how to control the using of their time and it is possible to handle everything. So if the family can afford the money of living outside, maybe we should give it a try. Actually there are many other things to worried in college life, because it is a big break of life. We start to learn things not only for tests and we start to plan our future, maybe start to feel stress out but those are just what we have to face.

My favourite season of the year could not be other than winter. When the weather is cold, I feel better, and I will tell why. When the weather is warm, I fell annoyed. In the summer, my body feels uncomfortable. I can't have good food, I need to drink much, much water... when the weather is hot, I cannot sleep very well, and making sports is a great sacrifice. So, I always welcome the winter. Lower temperatures make me smile. When the winter comes, I sleep very well. I can eat several delicious things, I do not feel thirsty, and making sports outside is amazing. While in the summer I have difficulties to wear some clothes, in the winter I can easily use several of them. So, I have all the motives in the world to love the winter. During the winter, it is possible to travel to those places where the snow fall down. Paisages become wonderful! When the winter arrives, and one is close to the loved person, there is a sensation of love in the air. In the winter, to stay by the side of the loved person is simply amazing... I only appreciate the summer if I can walk along the beach. So, if the place where I live don't have beaches, I prefer winter, whatever be the occasion.

Most medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money, yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. I believe medical practice is based on humanitarian values; and Medicine is always in the front lines in the fight against health catastrophes such as pandemics. However, doctors often want to work in cities where wages are higher than in rural areas, and the reason is that doctors may have spent several years studying medicine; so they want to compensate the years wasted by financial profit from their work. Furthermore, nowadays studying Medicine is quite expensive and challenging; hence all of these factors contribute to why doctors would want to earn a lot of money for compensation. In my opinion, this problem can be solved by strengthing the healthcare sector through enhancing the healthcare facilities in rual areas, and increasing the salaries for doctors who wish to practise Medicine in rural areas. In addition, we can also encourage doctors to work in rural areas by promoting living conditions in rural areas where doctors can find suitable environment to live and work so that they can feel satisfied. On the other hand, in adavnced countries rural areas are well equipped with hospitals and medical centres which makes a little difference from big cities. However, in developing countries rural areas have a very bad healthcare system compared to cities; and that is what makes most doctors in developing countries prefer working in cities instead. Finally, strenghting the healthcare system and promoting the living conditions in rural areas can bring about a hope for many doctors to practise Medicine in rural areas.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion, it is a good thing because students at this level of education need to engage themselves in volunteer work in order to understand the meaning of humanity, collaboration and sense of collective work by which they can build their character and self-confidence. In addition to that, vounteer work inspires young people to learn about social responsibility; and I think that's how we build our communites. On top of that, making volunteer work as a compulsory requirement for graduation can be compelling for some people and not for some others, but I believe it is a good thing. Moreover, through volunteer work , high school students can learn valuable skills that will help them gain work experience. Working as a volunteer would help students to develop their inter-personal skills; because they will work in an environment that brings together people from different backgrounds and expertise; so it is a very amazing opportunity for students to explore the world of volunteer work!

I live at home with my family and I commute to school every day. I actually like this. You can learn while travelling, listen to music - it is quite relaxing, before or after the whole day. It is just 20 minutes long journey so it is not too far away. I like living with my family as there is always someone at home, and you are not alone for all the household stuff and you have time to study and so on. But I am also happy when nobody is at home as well. Then I can relax or study without being borthed. However I am adult and I can handle all my studying along. But some students are not responsible and self-discipline enough to look after themselves and their studying. Then it is definitely not convenient for those to live along while studying. I think that those students tend to be more rebellious and less responsible with their learning. But it is not always possible for students to live at home while studying because they might not live close to their school and they would have to commute far away to their school. Then student should be very self-discipline and keep touch with their parents to be controlled. I personally prefer living with my family but I think I could handle living on my own as well.

When I was in the elementary school, I used to have music classes once a week. Honestly, I wasn't the most dedicated student in the class neither the best one. It might see that I didn't like this class, but even it wasn't on my favorite classes list I'm a pretty defensor of the musical education in schools. As physical education, the musical education provides a complex group of skills that can be developed along the years, like keeping concentration, motor cordination and patience. Furthermore, this kind of class show to the students the cultural variety of rhythims around the word. Knowing this, the student can get to know about other subjects, such as history, geography and literature. When the students grow up, they become more independent and the youth requires them make new friendships. The music classes might help them to make a band with their friends or people who they have never met before. In addition, at difficult moments, like the end of the high school, the capacity of playing an instrument can bed them and make that moment easier to go through. Thus, I only see pros when the subject is having music classes at school or not. Even not being a musician nowadays, I can't live without music and I'm grateful to my musical classes to show me this adorable world.

In my opinion, nobody has to be forced to do nothing they don't want. A thing is very important: Good habits need to do part of each person life, no matter how they live, no matter how old they are. So, they'll begin to have a healthy life. Nowadays, it's obvious that so many people are not afraid of their health. Considerable part of people have acquired bad habits, which include eating fastfood, processed foods, not to go gym, low daily portions of water... and all this are enough to make people have bad life's quality. It's absolutely necessary this: To put inside the head of each human being that is very important to care about the body. Mental, psychological and physical health. I think that it will not be a recommendable thing forcing all university students and school children to do sports activities 3 or more times per week. More than to force them to act this way, it is important show them how a good lifestyle can contribute to raise the level of the productivity of all in daily life. Will the professional or scholar life be better? Of course, but not only! By maintaining good daily habits, several areas of life also will improve. When we put together good food, sports, inter relationships, smoking abstinence, alcohol consume's control and many other things we must do to have a pleasant life, it's possible to live during much more time with good health. So, I think that it is not necessary (and it is not pleasant, too) to force somebody to do something that they don't want. Life always show us that in many occasions, when we try to apply some habits in people when they don't like them, the results are not too good. After a period of time, some of these people use to practise old bad habits again. So, all the hard work to them will have being lost. It's better to bring solid, good argumentation, which will make people re-think their habits, and, so, they will be able to change her in a voluntary way.

They say music and mathematics are the language of the universe. Everyone in the universe is supposed to understand the language of mathematics and music. Despite they have the same root, they have some differences. Math is, essentially, reasoning whereas music means poem, inspiration and art. We need poem and beauty in our, sometimes, grey life. Music is essential for our leisure, concentration, for remembering good moments, for inspiration for work and to forget, for instance, some problems. It can recharge our energy with hopeful and inspiration for searching solution for many problems. Music is important for our life. For children, adolescents, adults and elderly. Without music it would be impossible to dance, to provide action and feelings in films. I think life would be impossible without music. Even primitive civilization composed music to celebrate peace and victory, to enjoy leisure time and to offer gift to God.

Although most important part of the people like summer season when all people are on the south French coast, Iprefer winter season when the weather is bad in France and you can flight to the exotic countries where temperature of the water is cool with a beautiful sun. I like this season because it is quiet calm in the foreign countries. I prefer working during the summer season in France when there is a lot of people to buy my products in the south of France. I think that is a better solution fir me because I don't to be on holidays surrounded by a lot of people and have a lot of trafficjam. For me holidays must be in a quiet place where there are a few people. For example this year I will flight to Venezuela country during February month.

Dear council, I am writing to express my disagrement with the current idea that is being thought to be implemented regarding the usage of mobile devices on public transport and more facilities. In the first place and above all, using electronic devices in the previously mentioned places does not affect anyone in a negative way, in fact, people that take public transport for work or education displacement often use it for helpful pourposes or entertainment, which should be taken into consideration as well since some trips can be long and dull. Furthermore, regarding shops and restaurants, people using electronic devices can be anything but harmful or disrespectful. For instance, people taking pictures of their meals or clothes could attract customers or advertise these places in some way, which in light of shop and restaurant's owners will not be seen as something needed to be banned. Last but not least, I would like to mention too that the attempt of preventing people of using theses devices, might only make the situation well worse due to the fact that people may rebel against it, it would be needed to implement new regulations and punishments... And if we balance the consequences, and considering that it is not one of the pressing issues in our city, the efficiency of this change may be sparse at best. I just desired to express my opinion and foremost help with the problem. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can offer aid with anything. I hope it was relevant information. Yours sincerely.

Some activities requested by schools to their students in order to graduate are very important because it introduces some values to students, and more, depending where these students are studying they would have a chance to interact with their community or do anything relevant to contribute with their cycle. However, the way that it is presented and requested to students is not the best way to do that. Broadly speaking, I think schools that apply this philosophy to their educational system should think of another approach to justifying and motivating students to create and develop this sense of responsibility to their community. Despite being considered a requirement in some schools, that is, this activity is mandatory, there are other ways to teach these values and their importancy. A great example of this is extra curricular activities where students immerse themselves in the aspects that are proposed to them. I could list some of them here, to begin with students living with other family, for instance, in a farm or in a fishing area, and them helping these families with their daily tasks. Second, students can spend a few days helping out in parks designed to preserve forests and natural wildlife. It is possible enumerate lots of different activities, whereas it is not necessary, because the idea here is the same, only shows that are another possibilities to show studensts that volunteer work matters, even when it is not a requirement. So, to wrap it all up, I strongly recommend students and people in general do volunteer work. As a result of that effort we can experience a better environment.

Nowadays, video games are very popular among the children. These games are very interesting. As a result, many children addicted to it. However, some parents believe that these games can have a negative impacts on their children. On the other hand, the other parents think that it may have some positive effects. As for me, I don't think it may have good effects. There are many reasons why I say this. If the children play the games, they have to sit for the whole day because these games are interesting. So, they don't want to stop anymore. It is not good for their eyes and their health. In addition, when they are playing games, they forget everything like to eat, to drink and to sleep regularly. In the long run, there may have many bad things on them. Moreover, if they play games all the time, they don't want to do anything. For example, to help their parents, to do their lessons regularly, to communicate with other friends. Therefore, I agree that playing games can have a lot of negative impact on the children. Thus, parents should control their children before they addicted to the games.

Some people think that zoos are good places for the people to learn about animals. On the other hand, the other people think that animals should stay according to their nature. So, it is not good to keep them in zoos. However, different people have different point of views. I don't want to judge exactly which one is right or wrong. However, to be honestly, I think that it is better to keep animals in zoos. There are many reasons why I say this. In doing so, the animals don't need to worry about their meals because people feed them regularly. Moreover, they can stay for their whole life without any dangers. In addition, they don't need to worry about their health because the doctors come and take care of them very often. And then, some people who come to the zoos feed them because they love them. May be some people will say it is not their nature and they should stay freely in the forests. It might be true but it is not safe for them because of the hunters. Thus, zoos is the best place for the animals.

And they can have difficulties to communicate with the other people with different cultures. Another thing is that they may be homesick when they are away from their home.

Sport is, with no doubt, essential to everyone, both to young and older people. Especially to students, doing a sports activity is very important because it allows them to distract from the long hours of study and to free the body from the accumulated stress. Students spend lots of time sitting in a class listening to professors or sitting in their own rooms or libraries studying or writing. Therefore, they need to move, not only in order to stay fit but also to recharge themselves and gain the necessary energy to face the day. Lots of high-school and university students may think that training make them lose time they could use to study or to relax, by hanging out with friends or watching television. Anyway, watching a tv series, for example, does not help them to disconnect the mind and recharge the energy, it simply gives them the impression of relaxing, which is important but not so beneficial as training. Regarding younger students, such as those who attend the primary or the middle school, I think parents should make them understand the importance of sport, but without imposing them something they like. Every child should be free to choose the sport he or she most likes and feel comfortable with. Going to the gym, attending fitness courses, doing a team or an individual sport, instead, helps them staying fit while having fun and in many cases also making friends. Despite the temporary fatigue, both the body and the mind will benefit from that. They can sleep better, they can study better, they can have, in short, the necessary energy to face a normal weekday. For this reason, many schools and universities are thinking of forcing students to do sports activities. Even though it might seem too much, I think it is a right choice. Students, however, have to be free to choose the kind of activity that most suits them in order not to feel discomfort.

Really, music are not important in our lives. In the first place just to take this more seriously, we don't need music to eat, to think or to drive to our jobs, but all the daily chores would be more pleasant with that. Moreover music can change our perception of time and it build a connections that we have made in the past, for example, don't you ever had a random thought with some music and suddenly you remember about a situation very clearly? If the answer for that question is yes, you must thank the music. On top of that music can change our feelings, recently reaserchs had been discovered that music affect the behavior and society, this explanation is given due to the harmony, because anyone could sense that harmony and understands that in different ways, being able to turn more agressible or calm and it differs from one person to another.

Mobiles phones have become very important in our day-to-day life, and we use it very often to communicate with our family, friends and co-workers. I cannot imagine if people can give up using mobile phones one day, because every aspect of our lives has become connected with the use of phones. In spite of that, phone calls on public transport, and in shops and restaurants can be very disturbing to people around us especially at these places people need some quietness. I guess banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants may not be the solution and it could be quite strict decision if town council plans to apply it; because simly people find it hard to comply with such law. What I claim to be the soultion is raisning awareness about how much disturbance and harm could be caused if we use mobile phones in public transport, shops and restaurants. Awareness programmes could include attention singboards and may even TV programs or videos on the internet to educate people about the proper way to use phone calls in public. People sometimes have to make phone calls to ask for help or opinion over what to buy in shops or what to eat in a restaurant. Finally, technology in phones has made lives easier more than ever before through instant commuication with our beloved ones, so it is very difficult to ban using it in public places, but we can always encourage people to be keep quite when using phones in public places.

Music is being used as a way to convey our emotions, it boosts our confidence, removes tension, bring everyone closer and removes the gap between people and people. Since people had wisdom , music has been created in some tribals as a way to celebrate a special occasions and make chances for youngsters to make friends with the others and now it is representing for a cultural of one country.

Also you don't have privacy when you must phone for a private subject. Today there is a lot of open spaces for being able to manage easley your employees. That is between the management and the control of your employees. There is already problems between manager and employees about this type of organization of the work.

If someone could choose and plan their life, I think many would. Choosing between a short intense or a long relaxed life would be a hard decision. Living a short but intensive life would be a good choice for many people because you could do activities like sky diving or climbing the Mouth Everest.

MUSIC: ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS IN LIFE If you have ever thought that we do not need music in our lives, I cannot help but say that you are absolutely wrong. For better or worse, we all need some artistic forms of expression to let our feelings go, and music is one of the most powerful ones, without doubt whatsoever. Unbelievable though it may seem, music is something essential for me. I would even assure you that I could not feel free without it as I am a singer and throughout music, I manage to express my feelings. Had it not been for the fact that I became a mother very early, I would have dedicated my entire career to music. Nowadays it is just a job that I do from time to time, but not a full-time job, as I wanted it to be. That being said, I would also like to mention some other benefits music has, especially concerning mental health. Somehow, music connects with some parts of our brains, making us experiment with sensations. Maybe it is that power that makes music be used as a mental therapy as well. In a nutshell, artistic expressions are significant and pivotal for us as individuals as they play an extremely significant role in our existence.

Capitalism is the main reason behind this situation. People often want to work in places where they earn more money to support a better standard of life. The intervention of the government into the economy could be justified. After all this an externality and government could provide an incentive for working in these areas to solve the problem. Maybe a better salary or social benefit could be a good response. This could bring more doctors to rural areas and make a call effect. Incentives are always a good tool. Develop good services and cultural life in rural areas may be a good idea as well.

It is usually the case that many of us lie on a daily basis, without even acknowledging this fact. It seems to be a habit we have formed during our everyday conversations. This specific issue piqued my interest, therefore this paper shall contain my personal opinions on this matter. Undoubtedly, we perceive lies as a token of unreliability and untrustworthy. Lies, once exposed, can make us feel anxious and tense. In worse cases, it may result in serious losses. Yet eventually, something called "white lies" appeared in our lives. A so-called white lie is when someone lies for good reasons. It could be lying about the death of your family member, about someone being in serious health conditions etc. I understand where they are coming from, however, I quite condemn lying in general. If I were to explain my point further, I'd put it like this - I find it disturbing to not know about something I'm supposed to. Then again, I'm not saying that I'm completely innocent. To be honest, white lies are especially unbearable. I'd rather know about my family's losses and cry about it than not know about it at all! I believe many people think alike, but nevertheless, this is a habit so hard to adjust most of us can barely do it. Perhaps, this world was meant to have lies to be complete. To wrap things up, I don't appreciate lies, but as long as we don't manipulate this power, we could still live harmoniously with their existence!

In my personal opinion, I do think that would be more benefecial to have more than one teacher each year. The reason for this is that every person is different, and learn more effectively in different ways, meaning that more options of teachers, would be a better option. On another hand, is a good point having the same teacher following, and mentoring a student. The advantage, is that this specific teacher would know better the students weaknesses, and strengths, being able to help in a more personalised way. I guess the more beneficial way to solve this problem, would be the option of having different teachers, but all of them should follow the students for more than a year, ideally, for all the school period. But again, there's no right or wrong, it depends on the student, this question was very tricky. Before asking that, why not know the students better, make an analysis to find out which way, each one of them, would learn better?

In recent years, the active lifestyle of young people sharply decreased. It is proven that moving your body and doing sports activities often lead to a long healthy life. The main question is if students and school children should be forced to do sports for at least three times a week. In order to keep everyone healthy, activities are needed. The body needs different movements to stay fit and active. Many studies showed that movement and flexibility are decreasing with age. Therefore older people should do fitness every other day. On the other hand newer studies found out that young people are losing their fitness and flexibility rapidly. This often correlates with playing video games or studying all day. With this information sporty activities should be included in school and universities so that young people learn how to move their body in order to build and strenghen the right muscles so they do not get a bad posture for example. However, if something is forced upon you, you do not participate with enthusiasm or give up completely. A good idea would be to offer many different kinds of activities. Many school children like to play football. Other young people like to dance or run. Universities and schools should give their students three hours a week to do sports but should not force them to do anything specific. On some days one feels like going swimming or jogging and on other days they only want to stretch and do some Yoga. It is important for schools and universities to listen to their pupils. When I was young I was forced to do specific sports and I did not like them. Now that I am at university and am not forced to do anything I really enjoy doing and trying out new things. I think this would work for many other young people, too, if they get the chance to try out different sports.

Working as a volunteer teaches people to be more tolerant and sensitive to one's needs and feelings. I believe that any amount of volunteer work contributes to young people's development as sympathetic human beings. Requiring volunteer work in high schools encourages students to give something back to the world. For instance, having to do this kind of work involves needing to learn how to better manage their time, alternating their studies with their leisure activities and with being a volunteer for an organisation. If at first it seems a little unorthodox to make it mandatory for students to do volunteer work in order to graduate, they must not see it this way. It represents a way of learning to communicate with other people from different social situations, thus developing oneself. Moreover, socialising with them, sharing stories and feelings, can evolve into meaningful relationships and not a burden students have to carry just to graduate. All things considered, requiring a reasonable amount of volunteer work to be done so students can graduate is a good way of teaching them some of the most important morale values of humanity.

The school of the future will be different in the future. Everything is changing now. We can learn everything that we wish both online and outside. Therefore, we can learn in our own space and own time. Nowadays, technology is developing with the time. So, people find the easiest way to improve their learning progress. In the future, I think that, we can do everything by using the Internet widely. I don't know exactly what will be the same. But, I am sure that the schools will be more developing in the future. Moreover, people can even replace with the robots to teach the students. May be the schools will remain as usual. However, people will use technical aids more widely in the future. So, everything will finish quickly and it can save the time too. In doing so, the schools can run more smoothly.

Dear Sir/Madam, First of all, I personally think it is unreasonable to ban the use of mobile phone in public. Here are the reasons: Firstly, we live in an era of globalization now; the popularity of using smartphones is one of the biggest signs of globalization. Today, every social activity is replied on the smartphone, and banning them sounds like rejecting to accept the development of modern technology. Secondly, smartphone can make colossal contributions to the town's living qualify. For example, if someone takes pictures of the local landscape or local restaurants, and uploads them onsocial media like Instergram, which may help to attract more tourists to come. In this case, the economy of the town will be increased, and this money can be used for the development of the twon such as upgrading the infrastructure. The power of the media is huge nowadays, using them wisely can bring unexpected benefits. Thirdly, such a policy may diminish town's reputation that not only fo locals but also for tourists. Locals would think this policy is ill-advised; they will either protest or leave the town. The tourists would think this policy is irrational, therefore the number of tourists will be decreased. At this point, none of the situations mentioned above are good for the development of the town. In conclusion, I think banning smarphones is unreasonable in all aspects.

Before discussing this problem, we have to look at the function of truth first. Truth is the result of an explanation of an event; people use the truth to figure out puzzles or questions. But sometimes the truth is cruel; for example, it would be merciless to tell an 80 years patient that he will die soon. At this point, a lie or a white lie could make him feel more comfortable. My opinion is that truth and some white lies can make the world a better place. According to my own experience, one of my neighbours got divorced a couple of years ago. But they didn't tell their children the fact of their divorce; they told them that they were separated for only a few months instead. This kind of white lie would make it more acceptable for children than telling them straight about every detail about their parents' divorce. Another example is my friend's grandfather, who died 2 years ago. When he got cancer, he was 82 years ago, the doctor didn't tell him the fact, but he told my friend's parents because the doctor thought it would be too ruthless to inform an 82 years old man that his life was about to end. My friend and his family spent a great deal of time with his grandpa and cherished his last period of time in the world. At the end, this old man died in happiness and without knowing the fact that he got cancer. Again, in this case, lies are more appropriate than facts. Because sometimes the truth is harmful and unacceptable, lies will make life easier at some points. In conclusion, lies sometimes can beauty this merciless world than a cold-blood truth.

Music has become a part of my life. When I look back on my life, music has alwasy been there. When I was a little, my mother always played records. I naturally became familiar with the classical music that my mother liked. When I was in school years, I learned to play the piano. Exercising for the piano everyday helped me in many ways besides playing the piano. I even played the trumpet in the school brass band. I experienced the joy of playing in an ensemble, which is different from playing solo. Now, I teach playing the piano to my children. I hope that I can share some of my experiences with them. For me, music is always there, like air or water. No matter whether I had a happy day or a bad day, I always kept playing the piano. Perhaps the time playing the piano was a time to face myself. Without music, most of my life experiences would not have been available. I cannot imagine my life without music. Even now, my son is exercising for the piano beside me.

Since the beginning of time people have used music as a way to reflect their feelings, the complexity of it classifying it as one of the finest arts. Nowadays, most young people believe understanding and learning to play a musical instrument requires a great talent thus refusing to do it of fear they might not possess the ability. To my mind, students should be encouraged to take up music classes in schools. The fact that some schools do not offer music classes at all, not even on choice, may be a result to one of the most common misconceptions: that music is for talented ones. However, numerous scientific discoveries have contradicted this idea, demonstrating how studying music enhances human brain's logical and mathematical thinking ability. This is the main reason why all students should study music in schools. To add more to the idea, learning to play a musical instrument may prove beneficial in developing young people's social skills. Acquiring the ability to play a melody develops one's receptivity towards their own feelings, helping them to better understand and manage their emotions. By accomplishing this, students will also be able to sympathise with other people and deal with situations they might encounter. This represents another important reason to study music in school. All things considered, students should definitely be given the opportunity to study music in schools, leaving aside the benefits, it can be very enjoyable to be able to make music that can emotionalize other people.

The topic that we are going to consider today is what do we think about zoos? animals in cages ,an animal park... I personally believe that everybody like animals , however , we have to analyse how is the best way to watch them. When I was a child to spend a day at the zoo was something incredible. It was an amazing day , you were running from one site to another to be the first one to watch the monkeys,lios or zebras with your face stick at the crital or hang around the cage. But, when I grew up, I realize that, perhaps it wasn't the right place for the animals because they looked like sad ,old... they didn't have enough land to move around. Nowadays, we can find others locations when this wild animals aren't looked up, when they can run free and share different spaces with others species in a more natural environment.

Before answering this question, we have to look at the reason why university students and schoolchildren stop doing sports. There are two main reasons, either don't have time for sports or too lazy. However, the difference in conditions of countries can be an influencing factor too because children have different school times in different countries. In some countries like China, Chinese students have no time and energy for sports. They live under huge learning pressure that most of their time has been taken by learning time and homework time. According to analyses, the average sleeping time for Chinese students is 6 hours, which means they won't be able to have any free time for sports; if the government insists on asking school children to do sports at least 3 times per week, which will bring nothing but pain and stress to students. But school children in the western world have plenty of free time after school. At this point, I would suggest the government set up some PE lessons, so kids can do sports at school. I personally think that all university students should at least do some sports 1 or 2 times per week. Because they are already adults, which mean they could manage the time between study and workout. And In the adult world, I believe that a muscular body can boost your sex appeal and makes you look more attractive, regardless of gender. Nevertheless, although Doing sports can not only build a prettier body figure but also can lead people to a healthy life. But it doesn't mean students should be forced to do something; doing sports should be spontaneous. Because if the government force students to do sports, then they probably won't enjoy it, on the contrary, they might start hatting it. In conclusion, although the idea of asking students to do sports is brilliant, but it can't be forced.

Many people say that television is to entertain but there are many things more than entertain. Actually, television can be to entertain, to educate, and to give information. They are three main purposes of television programs. In fact, people watch television for entertainment and information. Because they want to keep in touch with the world with time by watching on television. On top of that, they can watch weather forecast, movies, series, plays, International news and local news, health programs, live shows and talk shows on TV. Therefore, television is not only for entertainment and pleasure but to educate. In addition, I totally agree that it can also educate the people too. If you always look movies on TV, you are just watching it for your pleasure. However, if you watch all the things on TV, I am sure that you will get useful knowledge from it.

I think that music plays at some point one of the most important roles in our lives. At first, the suitable music played in the proper situation brings out our emotions. For example, if imposing music is played on the emotional scene of a movie, we are touched deeply. But if graceful music is played on the battle scene, we feel it strange. Next, we can tell some messages to someone by using music. Some write a message of love to someone, another expresses his feelings on the music. That is such an effective means to inform massages that we receive them clearly or seriously. In the last, if there were no music, our lives would be extremely boring. Music enables us to forget bad things. That's why the world without music would be stressful. Thanks to music, we can live now happily. In conclusion, music is an essential element of our lives.

As I am not a parent myself, I can't really say in practise, which are the effects with children playing video games. To begin with, I was a child who used to play a lot of video games. That's one of the main reasons why I got interest in studying English. Also, depending on the game we can learn a lot of logic, and even some geometry. I guess, playing a lot of video games had an impact in my levels of concentration when I was a kid. So I would say that there's a trade off, maybe we should allow children to play, but it has to be a limit, and prioritise another activities, such as Sports, reading, and social networking. Why not provide some educative Games? It could turn the learning process in something fun, keeping the kids studying, and having fun at the same time. I guess that would be the best approach, and less painful for both, parents, and children. To most of our problems in life, balance is always the key to solve them.

Music sometimes can translate what I can't express with my own words, it describe how I am felling or what I am thinking. Music also gets a mood in certain situations, when I am working, for example, I like to hear a music and this helps me to get focus, or where I have to do a boring activity, like cleaning the house, music turns it fun. Music helps us to memorize some moments, imagine a wedding, and the music that the bride and fiace dances, you'll always remember that moment because the music, it turns the moment special.

Which is better university students' moving away and living on their own while they are attending school, or living at home with their family while they are students? I think it is up to the personalities and the condition of their family. Each of them has different merits and demerits. Therefore, there is no absolutely correct answer. The independence of a university student from his/her family may lead to growth in his/her personality. This experience helps him/her to live after graduation. However, it costs many financial burdens for them and their family. Some need to help of their family, and it may make it them to be difficult to study at university. If the students can't afford to live alone, they perhaps should live at home with their families. The less concern they have, the more they can live freely. It may lead to their growth. For the reasons stated above, I can't choose which is better, but I think they should select what they think is better so that they can study well.

I am going to start my explanation with a classic sentence, it depends. If the zoo offers a good condition, and space for those animals, it could become a great source of education, and spread the importance of take care of our environment. Taking kids to the zoo, is a great way to connect them with the wild animals, and show them how important it is to preserve our natural resources. To be fair, I understand people who don't like zoos, and to keep the animals caged, for entertainment purposes. Also, we have to face every day, with illegal traffickers of wild animals, and zoos offering awful conditions for their animals. I guess, A good fiscalization, and punishment, would be a good option to reduce, and monitoring those black markets. To finish, I have to say the key will always be a good education, preventing many of those situations where ignorance prevails, and those situations will keep happened with no remorse.

A question of how to live your life bother most people. Will you choose a long life but boring or an exciting but short life? For me, I would choose a short but exhilarating life. Living a short but intense life means that my life is full of surprises. For example, I may be traveling worldwide and face dangerous situations like an avalanche taking place while I'm climbing Mount Qomolangma. But I will eventually be fine, and these thrilling moments will be saved in my mind as precious memories. It is also possible that I won a million-dollar lottery and got cancer at the age of 50. Even though my life might be short and miserable at the end, but I still don't regret having this kind of life. Because what I have been through in my life can be written as an adventure book that can be read by generations However, there are still people who prefer to live a long, calm life. Living a calm life means your family will be extremely steady. You may marry a girl in high school and have two lovely kids. You will wake up at 9 am, return at 5 pm; the rest of your time will be spent with your family, and it will repeat itself day by day, year by year. Although your life might be boring, it's still worth spending it with the family. At the end of your life, you will certainly die in happiness. In conclusion, I prefer to live a short but intensive life.

The Power of Music We need to express ourselves to communicate. We have been doing it for ages and music, whether for enjoyment in listening, the emotional response, performing, or creating, is important for us. Music also can be really powerful. Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer can remember a song from childhood because music can help us to connect, even after verbal communication becomes difficult. Music make us remember a special times in our lives, whether good or bad, it is the last thing our brain forgets. Music is important no matter what age do we have, accompanies us through moments. I can remember the first concert I went. I can remember the first song I danced with my husband. I often remember my mom favorite's song now that she is gone. I cannot imagine life without art. Art and music are basic human functions because the desire to create cannot be avoided.

Beyond any doubt, the ideal state of affairs would be always telling the truth, no matter the subject. Life in such a society would be far different from what we know in our own. There would not be confidence crisis and everybody could trust without fear. However, actually we are not prepared to such a pristine truth. Frequently people see themselves compelled to lie in order to comply with social arrangements or etiquette. Let's see some examples. If someone asks about their own appearance, the answer will be invariably positive or, at least, not entirely negative, although we know that it is not always the case. The same happens when we give opinions concerning feelings and performances. In these situations we tend to mitigate and ornament the truth, what is not the same thing that being polite. Politeness and truth are compatible. This confusion is a common error. You can do both. However, as previously mentioned, since we are not ready to remove social conventions when they colide with truth, some small "white lies" ended up becoming necessary. Using the same example above: whether you answer "you are ugly," certainly somebody's feelings will be hurt. It is better to avoid that. Unfurtunately, persuing veracity at all cost does not pay off yet. Nonetheless, I believe that one day, when we have learned to be more emotionally matured, the truth will reign undisputed.

Nowadays companies are concerned about work environment, and therefore, there is a debate about whether offices should be open or enclosed spaces. Open designs are superior because of promoting friendly work places and discouraging competition. A open-space office develops a healthy work environment. In fact, cubicles without walls encourage workers to co-operate between them due to the lack of communication barriers, making the work environment friendly. For example, these open designs are allowed tech-companies to improve their performance and productivity. Another point to have into account is that open-spaces might reduce hierarchy levels between workers because of the concept of sharing the space. Some detractors of this open-office layouts claim that it could reduce productivity. Although being in contact with everybody ,without physical restrictions, could lead to excessive loss of time, there is a great deal of evidence in favour. For example, it has been recognised that productivity is linked with healthy work environments, and as a consequence, better work performance is related to proper team work. In conclusion, the concept of open-offices is superior to traditional offices because it promotes a co-operative environment and helps to reduce job hierarchies, and all these factors are reflected on high productivity. The future of architecture is open spaces, in public and private sectors.

The moment young people have to choose a university they balance their qualities and skills with what they would like most to work like. To my mind, it depends on the type of person students are that influences most their decision regarding whether to live on their own or with their family. It is a well known fact that moving away requires a broad sense of independence. Young people who live alone must single manage their finances and learn how to better plan their schedule in order for them to cope with every day challenges. Moreover, they need to cook and do the laundry individually without the help of a relative. On the other hand, deciding to remain at home during their college years has its benefits. Students can be supported by their families, who help young people with the house chores while they have more time socialise and a higher level of energy to put into their studies. What is more, it is less likely for students who live with their relatives to get homesick. All things considered, young people have to make an important decisions when choosing where to continue their studies, thus they need every bit of support they can get from their loved ones.

Nowadays, it is undeniable that talking about university is difficult, since the crucial decision that students must take. They become adults and, as a result, independent people. I met some people who, despite distance, are studying in crowded Spanish places, like Madrid or Barcelona. As a consequence, learners have to live alone or in students communities, where they share a room to pay less money. I agree that live without parents is going to prepare youth for the future life, and it is perfect if you want to get married or if you want to have children, but it is true that you must have on your wallet a considerable amount of money. Moreover, the student must be a mature person, therefore he has other responsibilities besides get an exceptional degree and join a job. Looking at the other option, although it is great to have a bed, food and water completely free, and you don't miss you family,I think independence is a crucial part of people's life, so the more you leave home, earlier you get independence and responsibilities. Anyway, I would choose the first option because, in spite of money amount, you can always get a temporal job to earn money.

In the past fifty years, English has become an internationally spoken language , which is extremely convenient. However ,it doesn't mean learning other foreign languages is now useless. In my opinion, learning a foreign language these days is as important as it was in the past. Learning a foreign language is indeed a real asset to travel or to work. Speaking foreign languages is a plus on a job market ever more competitive, especially when you want to work abroad. In addition, there are nowadays more and more colleges that ask for besides English speaking students, German and/or Russian speaking students. With the globalization, being able to communicate with someone who doesn't have the same native language than you and that doesn't necessarily speaks English is a real advantage. Secondly, beyond the usefulness of learning a foreign language, it is an excellent exercise for the brain. The specialists say that the more you learn, the more learning becomes easier . Therefore, learning several foreign languages is far from being unreachable. Furthermore, it gives exercise to your brain- which can be quite useful indeed.

My favorite season of the year is summer because of the warm weather, the school vacation, and the endless fun. I really enjoy the warm weather because it’s the perfect time to do outdoor activities. My favorite part about summer has to be the fact that school is closed for two months. During summer, you’re free to do whatever you want, not worrying about curfew or waking up early for school. Summer time is a great time to relax with friends and family by soaking up the sun at a beach or having dinner together. I love the hot and humid days that makes you want to dive into a fresh and cold pool. When summer time starts, you can wear lighter clothes, which are much more comfortable. The weather allows people to go outdoors ,too. The break calls for staying up late and waking up whenever you want to. Everyone works so hard during the school year, so they deserve that free time. Summer times are stress free, relaxing, and basically fun. You don’t have to worry about homework, projects, and studying for a test. One of my favorite summer pastimes is staying up late watching movies and eating junk food, and then waking up late and having brunch.

To be honest, I never thought about if I have a favourite holiday. To begin with, I will start writing about the first holiday that comes to my mind. Before the pandemic, I did a big trip to Europe, the whole trip took almost a month. In this trip, I visited Austria, Hungray, England, Poland, Germany, and lastly Portugal. The amazing thing about this trip is that I travelled with different people during the journey. Each friend has his own style, and personality, that has given an exciting touch for the trip. I think that's the reason why this holiday was one of the most important ones to me. As an old quote says, Happiness is only real, when shared. So I had lived so great moments, and the most important, I was with my friends. So many stories, people we met during the trip, I was able to visiting old friends, which I had seen in years. To finish, that holiday, made me know a lot about myself, and go through my limits, physic, and mentally speaking.

Listen to life's music. Are you one of those who can't live without listening to music? If your answer was yes, this article was made for you. Music have a huge impact on our lives, since it can change our frame of mind and bring different memories to us. For instance, when I go to the gym to have my daily workout I need my headphones in order to give my best. There are songs that motivate me and I feel powerful while I'm listening them. At the same time, we can remember different moments or people with songs, in my case when I listen to Oh Darling Mama, I always remember those summers with my family in Las Bahamas. Personally speaking, if we didn't have music life would be much more boring, therefore we should keep creating new songs and playing with new music styles.

In general that is not a good solution to ban something or a behaviour of people by using legal rule. I prefer convince people of a right behaviour. In this case Town council would like to ban mobile phones on public transport , shops and restaurants. The difficulty of this rule is to be applicated and controlled. The Town council must create a police squad to check if the rule is effectively applicated ! This squad will be source of tensions between citizens, and owners of restaurants. That is also stress cause between citizens. They will provoke fighting between us where police squad will be obliged to intervene. This situation risks to degenerate! That will be better for the Town council to promote a preventive action. Each citizen will be actor of this change. It will occasion to promote new values of conviviality in publics areas. The Town council will also promote places where you will use phone. For example telephone booth where nobody will be disturbed. In fact this is a problem of education and the well being. The Town council must introduce in a college class information about a good attitude in the area with your phone or other technology. The goal of these class will learn how to live with other public in public areas. This policy will be useful for other area of living well together.

Listening music has different relations. For example, there is a special linked between music and mood.

Is a fact that nowadays there are many students who choose to study abroad, most of them in order to learn another language. If you are a student and are thinking about studying in another country you should know that this unique experience has a lot of perks, but unfortunately also disadvantages. On the one hand, in terms of advantages, apart from learning a new language, studying abroad allows you to learn about another culture, which helps you to be in contact with other ways of thinking. Furthermore, being far from home and your family, helps you to become more independent. Last but not least, studying in another country can help you to make new friends. On the other hand, regarding disadvantages, you have to face a big challenge: listen to a foreign language 24 hours a day, which could be hard if you are not familiar with the language. Furthermore, unfortunately studying abroad requires money to cover different expenses, such as flights, accommodation, food, etc. In summary, I believe there are more perks than disadvantages, but you have to consider all of them in order to make a wise decision before moving to study in another country. If I were you I would grab the opportunity, as it may be once in a lifetime.

My favorite movie is Assassination classroom, it is action, and is an anime movie. there are also some comedy parts in the movie to make the audience laugh. At that time, there is a guy whose names Koro has destroyed half of the moon, and now, he is going to destroy the earth. But it is so easy with him so he feels bored and thinks about something more fun to do before destroying this beautiful planet. He become the teacher in the worst class, class 3-E, and promise that within a year if none of the students in the class can kill him, he will destroy the whole Earth. Through the film are all kinds of games that class 3E create to kill Koro-sensei (the name that the class gives to their teacher) They can not kill him, from guns, daggers, bombs to traps. Through each failed assassination, they learned more experiences and became more mature in each of Koro sensei's lesson, which were added into each game. The movie takes the audience through many kinds of feelings whenever they see the daring and elaborate plans of the 3E students. Through failed assassination, they discover their own potential, like a nerd girl becoming a potions expert, a forgetful class couple becoming a sniper,an ordinary student turned into a great leader. Each individual is a story of its own waiting for viewers to discover. In the end, Koro-sensei has been killed, the class was sad, they miss the day they study with Koro-sensei, but just some seconds later, Koro-sensei appear behind the students, turns out everything was fake and the assassination mission continued. It is the best movie I have been seen before, It has part 2 already but I don't have time to watch it, I hope that I can watch it soon, I recommend you watch it, it very nice.

One of the things that worries people most today is that in many rural areas thera are not enough doctors and in the long run it causes serious problems.

They need to earn more money because they want to live better. It must be added that in the city , you can be promoted and you have more opportunity to research. With this problem, on the one hand, I consider that some means solutions to the lack of doctors are; the Mayor could pay them for one house in rural areas. I believe that it is a way to attraction and promote the healthy lifestyle. the others hand, the government could create a subsidy to doctors in their taxes and in the future there could be laboratories for research in rural areas.

When somebody asks me what is my favorite season of the year, I do not have to think too hard. Speaking for myself, I strongly believe that winter is the best season of the year for a wide number of reasons. First of all, I know that most people think that during winter the weather sometimes is really cold, but I can't bear the heat. Moreover, the weather is not always freezing in winter. There are days when the weather brightens up, allowing you to enjoy the sunshine. Secondly, there are a lot of things to do during this season of the year, both indoors and outdoors. For instance, if you enjoy spending your leisure time outdoors, you can do winter sports such as snowboarding, skiing or ice skating, among others. These are very exciting sports which, unfortunately, cannot be enjoyed in summer. Last but not least, Christmas in Spain is celebrated in winter. I personally love Christmas because you can spend a nice time with your family and friends. It is a very emotional holiday and one of the main reasons I love winter. In summary, winter is my favorite season of the year due to offers you many beautiful things to do.

It is undeniably true that the majority of adolescents are staying in a fast-paced life these days. The most competitive environment leads them to less extra time to do physical activities for their healthy lives. Some people are convinced that teenagers need to put aside some time for leisure activities and do exercises at least 3 times per week. In this essay, I am going to explain why I agree with that statement by giving some suitable reasons and proper examples. To start with that, it is one of the excellent ideas to maintain young people's health and physical outlook to be good and healthy. To be more specific, nowadays, people, especially young children, are dealing with stresses and tiredness in their daily lives due to their work, school and social barriers. In that case, keeping time free for doing sports and physical exercises can help them to get run away from their daily stresses and tiredness, and enjoy the taste of freedom for a while. It can, moreover, recharge and refreshes the energy for the next few days. Encouraging teens to carry out sports and exercises can also bring numerous amount of advantages not only for their health but also for their performance in school or university. To illustrate that, doing the proper amount of exercises can measure a good circulation of blood in the body, which makes students be able to be more active and focused while they are doing their school assignments. Then, doing some sports; football and basketball, enhance students' teamwork and critical skills, which are vital personal skills that students are going to need when they enter the workplace later. To summarize, it is crucial for teenagers to make some time free to do some physical activities and sports in order to avoid depression and failure in their lives. Then, doing exercise is the best way to break away from the children's inactive lifestyles or run away from the screen.

It goes without saying that our workspace has to be a place where you could feel comfortable enough, so as to develop your tasks with as much efficiency as possible. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. To get started, I would mention that the way space is designed at one's work is usually claimed to be a substantial point in order to make us feel comfortable while working, and I could not agree more. Some conditions like illumination, proximity to your home, accessibility, partnerships, and so on, make comfort something possible for an individual. Nevertheless, some other factors can be nowadays claimed as significant like it is the case of design. Concerning this, we find those who defend an open design, pleading with the fact that information and ideas can be shared more easily that way, not to mention how much that enables socializing. Despite the benefits resulting from an open design, I cannot help but add that there are some jobs in which privacy is needed in order to achieve our goals. That could be the case of a writer, for example, or someone else whose job requires solitude for them to be focused. Last but not least, I would like to conclude by bringing focus to the fact that our personality is also crucial when it comes to choosing a work atmosphere. The one you find suitable for you is undoubtedly the best atmosphere to reach your desired aims.

Rising obesity rates have been labeled one of, if not the most, severe public health crises of today. Other illnesses caused by an inactive lifestyle are on the rise as well, although they do not reach the same levels of publicity. To combat these emergent problems we should put renewed effort into the physical education of our children, instigating mandatory physical exercise as a promising approach in this regard. University students, as well as all other adults, should be incentiviesed to lead an active life. It is without question that children need to be taught about the benefits of an active lifestyle. The health problems we as a society are facing are a direct result of neglecting physical education and failing to prepare becoming adults for the challenges of increasingly sedentary jobs. Likewise, it is apparent that such a programme must not be based on pure theory. School children need to experience the benefits of physical exercise first hand - they have to do sports activities on a regular basis. To achieve this, schools should expand PE classes and complement them with other measures such as mandatory participation in a sports club, compelling students to do sports at least 3 times a week. In contrast, all adults - including university students - should be regarded as self-determined members of our society and have the right to refuse any physical exercise if they so desire. For them, incentives can replace obligations as a means to encourage an active lifestyle. Universities could consider rewarding participation in sports teams and insurance companies may offer lower policy rates to those that are physically active. In essence, the primary instrument to tackle public health crises will always remain the education of our children. They should leave school fit to tackle the challenges modern work environments present. For adults, incentivising an active lifestyle should replace compulsory measures.

We are two doctors and seven nurses. It is very impossible to attend many people. In fact, some patients need a special medical treatments such as surgery, but we don't give them. The main reasons for this issue is that the place is not vicinity the city, and many doctors are not want to change your place of home, and leave your families, although several times they make a lot of money than the cities, the live is not easy here, because there are not places to fun, such as parks, museums, supermarkets etc. On another hand the afternoons are very beautiful, you can bread the clean air, and look at the mountains. I think that the solution is complicated, but may be, the doctors could be to visit our hospital for some weeks, and to know the town, the nice and friendly people. I'm not sure that they would like your place of residence. But they will have a great experience.

Music is always present in the most important moments of our lives, from the saddest moments to the most joyful ones. I daresay that music is something essential in our life. But the main question is: do you think all students should have to study music? First of all, I think that music has several benefits for us, apart from being enjoyable and a form of expression. In fact, according to different experts, music can help us to manage our emotions and feelings. Therefore there is a strong link between our mood and the music we choose to listen to. I strongly believe that music is a subject that should be included in the curriculum of all schools. Studying music should be as necessary and important as other subjects such as mathematics or science. In my opinion, music can contribute to the good development of our children. It is a creative way for students to express their emotions and a way to learn about culture and history. In summary, we need to raise awareness about the value and importance of studying music at schools. Therefore it is necessary that our governments make laws in order to implement these subjects. I hope in the future all students will be able to study music and that it will be as valued as studying mathematics.

The rural area can be a big problem because it doesn't give us the comfort enough to work or live there, mainly if you grew up in the big city where this place offers many benefits such as electricity, potable water, you can buy anything either in shop or e-commerce with no problem to find a shop closer to you. Besides having a great control about wild animals. Firstly, the electricity suppliers should spread the eletricity and offer the comfort enough to live in a hot day or not. Secondly, The spread of the shops around the area rural is important to increase access the goods and service. I don't wanna mean they must create too many shops in order to remove the view about rural area. But, offering specific point shop through the way.

People who lives in rural area tends not to use this service for lack of information.

A lot of doctors says that sitting and doing no sport is the new smoking and is really bad for you. This inactive lifestyle has many negative effects on health. This is why I would descuss if all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. I agree that university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. The first argument is that will help to become a better team. This means that sport espacilly teamsport in the school or in the university will help to became a team you and your classmates, because in some sports activities you learn to work together and be a good and fair team player. What will help in the end to form a better team in class to. The next thing is that it help you to get more focus on things. Because of the motivation and metal strength where you need to make sport you learn this skills where help you not alone in the sport. This skills will also be useful in other parts in your life or important skills too for learning at school for exams and focus on what you do or what you would do in the future. The last and the best point is that sport has much effect on your health. To be healthy some studies say that you should do at least 10000 steeps every day. So it is important for everyone to do sport every day. It is not so important what sport you do it has not so much difference of the effects. More important is that you make a sport where you like so that you are motivated to do your sport every day and do not break up after some days or weeks. These are my arguments why I think it is important for university students and school children should do at least 3 times per week sport.

It is argued that today's teens are the less active in decades. This statement can be sustained not only by the increasing number of young people with different illnesses associated to obesity but also by the worrying amount of fast food businesses, which raises year by year. I believe we should all be aware of the negative consequences an unhealthy died might cause us and try moving out of the comfort zones, which we are so familiar with. Although it might seem a drastic measure, I agree with the proposal that teenagers and students should attend sport classes at least three times a week. I will sustain my view with following arguments. First, the small number of sports hours in schools barely allow the teachers to enterprise some new activities. The coach is usually focused on following the school programme. If the amount of classes are to be raised, he would be more willing to diverse the educational programme, therefore some nutrition advice or examples of exercises to be done at home might be of his interest. Then, the students could be determined to take part in additional sports competitions, if they would feel they are enough prepared for. More exercise means more self-confidence. Playing sports can teach students how to become a leader, a follower and how to work together to achieve a common goal. Another important factor is the self-esteem the teenager could improve, by reshaping their body within the sports room. Some might argue that if someone wants to lose weight, then it's up to him, but in reality is very challenging and difficult to stick to the plan, if he is on his own. A class group engaged in sports activities would be far more effective and efficient, with visible results. Sports benefits to young people is undeniable and the entitled authorities should play their part in supporting them.

According to a recent survey, most people watch TV in order to entertainment. This survey also shows that for the majority of viewers the main purpose of TV is to entertain. But the first question we must ask ourselves is: can it also educate? In my opinion, I think that TV can also educate in different ways. On the one hand, there are countless documentaries you can watch on TV about different subjects, such as history, animals or science, among others. TV also offers you a window to foreign cultures and, therefore, allows you to be in contact with other ways of thinking. On the other hand, TV can sometimes be used as a way to educate children. Without doubt, cartoons have the potential to teach them important things, such as values and life lessons. In summary, it is a fact that the purpose of TV is not only entertain, but also to inform and educate people.

Exist a list of conditions which they must be present in my workstation. Silence, for example, is within this list. I usually prefer being alone while I do what I have to do. I don't hate my co-workers, absolutely!, but, when it comes to choose a type of workstation, if I could, I actually prefer staying alone. When I am doing my activities and there is no one next to me, my mind works smoothly and the results become better. Noise next to me can make me not paying attention to what I must. More than this: Great part of the people don't get talking in a low sound... they almost do this in a high voice, and they ignore the moment to stop the speeches and return to their own activities. This makes me feel annoyed, and I need to control myself: I almost always have the impulse of being uneducated. In a nutshell, these are the reasons I like working isolated. When I am alone, in a cubicle (not too small, of course!) or separated by walls, I feel myself more productive, my mind works better and staying far from the amount of co-workers' voices takes me to more tranquility. When I am alone, I even listen to music while I am developing my tasks. (You must agree with me: Working this way is much more difficult if the place where you are laboring is full of people talking about several subjects unrelated to your tasks, right?). So, I will ask you a thing... if someday you want to give me an opportunity to work with your employees, please... let me do it in a cubicle, or in a place with walls separating me of my co-workers, ok? I promise I will have friendship with them, but, in the moment of the work, I need silence, peace and maximum concentration... And my results will be the best!

Today in Sweden, there is a huge variation between how much young people do sports activities. Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all univeristy and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. First of all, it improves your learning. When exercising, the blood flows to your brain and the rest of your body. Studies states that you are more concentrated after been physicle active for at least 30 minutes. This means that exercising during school will help focus during lessons and therefore lead to increased grades. Secondly, it helps to reduce the risks of mentall illness. Mentall illness is an increased problem in our society. Not only among adults, but also among children. Lonelyness is one cause to mentall illness which can be avoided by joining a team. When you join a sport team you will be a part of a group. You may also make new friends. Problems can be shared with a friend and make you feel better, and thereby improves chances of not be mentally ill. I understand that not everyone will agree at first. Why be forced? My answer to that is that now we see a problem with the inactive lifestyle of many children and to solve that problem, we need to make it easier live an active lifestyle. So, how could we make it easier? To start with, I think it is necessary to force students to join sports teams in school because then they do not have any excuse. Children and teenagers will find new favorite activities that will last them forever. To improve learning, reduce risks of mentall illness and to make it easier to live an active lifestyle all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week.

The spark you need. Sports is fun, sport is teamwork and sports could be the spark you need. But to today's day many people, like students and school children are only gaming and not playing around a pitch. This is a repercussions because the health of those among us, is getting bad very bad. So the younglings among us need to be forced to do sports related activities for at least 3 times a week and this is why. The phenomenon of gaming has become an ordinary thing in today's society. But not all things it brings are benefits. Most of the consequences are bad, very bad. Firstly, teenagers who near the ages of 15 or 16 are having a bow in them posture due to staring hours and hours to a monitor. Another aftereffect of watching hours and hours to the same screen is that more and more children and students need glasses with the result that the prices for glasses are rising speedily. We can fix these blightes, watch how America did it. They invested much money in activities related sport such as a sports academy and not only for talented sportsmen or women. Secondly the Americain government also launched a new government area that is focusing on the brain activity of humans during exercises. They see a sigantifict result of health but also a great impact of self-esteem, so instead of people feeling more stressed they feel much more at ease. Perhaps you are now thinking after reading this why does we not have something like this here in Europe well that is coming from the massive cultures diversity here in Europe. But with effort I think we can overcome this obstacle and create an all sports based culture and personally I have a little hope that this will happen in the next few years and that the next generation will be the fittest and strongest generation that ever walked on earth.

I believe that efficiency should depend on the type of work performed by the office. For example, an accounting office is not the same as an advertising office. When your work is creative, the design of the space is an important part; colors, rooms to relax, have a meeting with clients or talk with other colleagues are important. You also have to think that some people work better in silence, others need music to be creative and all that elements must be considered in the design of the office. Now, if we talk about a more routine type of work, comfortable seating and a good coffee station are elements to consider. However, if we want to reach a real efficiency in the design of the workspace, we must talk to the people who work in that office. For example: wwhat do they need to be more effective in their work, how could this area be more comfortable to work in. Their opinion is important to determine if we missed a mistake in the design. In conclusion, together: workers, design experts, contractors must be listened to in order to reach an agreement on on design effectiveness.

Working as a volunteer, apart from being a requirement to graduate, is an exciting and worthwhile experience for all students. Therefore, I think that complete a certain amount of volunteer work has a lot of benefits for them. First of all, volunteering during high school allows students to develop and improve new skills. Furthermore, it is also a fantastic way to explore diverse career paths and opportunities. When it comes to choosing a field of study, volunteer work can help students discover what they want to be in the future. Secondly, volunteering allows students to support causes and help people and communities in need. In other words, they could make the world a better place. Thirdly, experiences like volunteering can help students to improve their mental health and emotional well-being. According to a recent survey, volunteer work can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Lastly, I know that not all students have the time to work as a volunteer. The life of most of them can be busy, if not chaotic. In spite of this, I strongly believe that this requirement is a fantastic experience for all students.

I believe that all students should learn about music and, I'm not saying this because I'm a musician and play saxophone, I believe that learning to play an instrument, to read a score, has a huge benefit. First of all, music can develop a child's talent, how do you know if you are good or bad in something if you do not try? Also, studies indicate that playing an instrument is correlated with academic success because music is another language that develop the left side of the brain. At the same time, music is fun, enjoyable, relieves stress in children, and teaches little ones to concentrate, great benefits to consider. Another reason I wanted to point out, which personally surprised me a lot, is that music helps to understand mathematics. Although they may seem different, music and mathematics have a lot in common. Aspects such as rhythm, propotions and fractions appear in the scores. To learn music, one must understand mathematics. Finally, music and self-expression are linked. We do not go to school just to learn traditional task, we also go to school to know ourselves, to know how far we can go, what our limits are, and music can serve to achieve that important kind of knowledge.

Nowadays we are living in an era in which technology is developing very rapidly. Video games are very popular, especially among children. As far as I am concerned, I feel that video games have a negative impact on children. On the one hand, I think that most video games are too violent for children. Furthermore, alcohol and drugs often appear in these video games. This is one of the main reasons why some parents believe that video games have negative effects on children’s development. On the other hand, playing video games for long hours is harmful. According to most doctors, children who play video games for long hours and do not do physical activity develop more illnesses. Therefore, we need to raise awareness about the importance of doing regular exercise and reduce the number of hours that children spend playing video games. In summary, as parents, we must be careful with our children’s video games, as they may have harmful impact on them.

What kind of life would you like to live? The answer to this question is function on the personal goal of each people. There is not great or bad choice, there is just a personal choice. Another difficulty is life won't be excepted and for this reason there is alternatively period of time quiet and intense. For this reason that is very difficult to describe a life quiet or intense because that won't be possible. But if you must do a theoratical choice I would prefer a long calm life until 100 years old. Because I like to be quiet and have time to reflection of yourself and the better situation to think about yourself is to be in calm and safe area. That is also opportunity to rhythm your life of different time: learning meditating and take care of your body. This is a choice of well-being. This style of life will give you a strong character and capacity to think thoughts. For me I will be more balanced person because I like the quiet environment without excitation surrounding you.

The requirement of volunteer hours in order to graduate I think is positive for the student. The school should teach not only traditional homework, but also educate and show students other realities that are closer than they think. Volunteering has many benefits and if a sixteen or seventeen year old student has the opportunity to do it I think it is a great privilege that we cannot let pass and that we should encourage. Volunteering not only looks good to apply for university, but it is an activity that can give you a sense of purpose because you become part of something bigger than yourself, and that is an important lesson to learn in school. In addition, volunteering gives you a sense of community, helps you feel connected to the place where you live, and also you would see that similar and different people can be friends and connect in the same community. In short, doing volunteer work will only bring benefits to the student, such as a sense of purpose, a sense of community, they will have the opportunity to meet people and friends different from themselves, and having all those benefits at such a young age is something that every student should be able to have.

A few days ago I heard that town council is thinking of banning the use of mobile phones in public transport, stores and restaurants, and I believe this ban could be a big mistake. Mobile phones are part of our lives. People use their phones to chat with friends, relatives, or even a co-worker on their way to the office. You can also use your phone to, for example, read the news, just as many phones have apps to read books on it. In addition, you can also pay with your phones nowadays for whatever you want to buy, experts say it is safer to pay with your phone than with your card or cash, so, why ban phones in stores if they are necessary? Why ban phones in restaurants if you can also pay for your food with your phone, but you can also see the menu of a restaurant using a QR code, which is safer nowadays because of the pandemic and possible infections. We cannot back in time where people communicated differently, those times are long gone. We live in this age where mobile phones are not just for making a call, we have so many things with our phones, we can do so many things with it than ban will only cause great dissatisfaction in people. I encourage the town council to focus on the real issues that affect the citizens and discard any ban on mobile phones.

Dear legislators, Recently, I've heard some news that you're going to pass a law that will ban people from using mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants for safety reasons, because the government wants people to be more concerned about the environment they live in. In addition, the government also hopes to strengthen the interaction between citizens and makes the town a more harmonious and warm town. Well, as long as I know the detail of this act, I have some suggestions for you who are on behalf of us to make a approriate balaced point between safety and practical side in the future. First of all, for safety reasons, I agree with the purpose of banning people from using cell phones on public transport. While I'm opposed to put this act in practice in the occasions such as restaurants or shops because the probability of security problems like killing, robbing, rowdiness is far less than that in public transport. For example, if someone got robbed or hurt on public transport, because everyone are phubbing so that no one noticed that someone has got hurt then it may cause more casualties in transportation. Contrarily, in the restaurants or shops, it's obvious that anything but robber will try to help victim suppress the bad guy, because barely each person will look around the environment such as stores and goods, even if some people are still looking at their phones. Thus, shops and restaurants are probably safer than public transport, which is not to the extent that the government mandates not to use phones. Second, I'm against banning cellphones in restaurants and shops, simply because the government wants civilians to have more face-to-face communication so that everyone, even strangers, isn't indifferent, which will improve reputation for hospitality. Nowadays, phones have become a medium to communicate, show concerns and express opinions. People will be connected closely than ever, and still, most people will have interactions if necessary. Therefore, the government is overthinking.

In my opinion, always telling the truth is not a proper way to go along with others in any occasions, as we are usually be taught to be honest to everything when we were children. Somtimes, difficult as it seems, we need to have some sweet lies rather than a bitter truth that may make us embarrassed and tense, for achieving a future positive outcomes and harmonious atmosphere. Firstly, sometimes if we are too honest, we may have some straightforward words to others especially for some who are sensitive to others' words and inlcined to be negative, or we will have more impacts on both scociety and personal life. For example, if someone is a little bit obese since you met last time, given that she may not afford negative description of her body,especially when she is depressed, we couldn't tell the truth to her directly. Instead, we should polish our words to be more euphemistic lest he/she feels that his/her self-esteem is hurt and then do some behaviors harming either herself or ourselves. Second, to have a positive consequence, there are some situations in life are not appropriate to say more details to others in case that they will lose hopes or even be killed. For instance, if we are doctors and are faced with a patient whose condition has deteriorated and may have recently passed away, we have to inform their parents that it still has hopes to cure only if they can abidy by the directions, of which the purpose is that giving some hopes to patients and their family so that they will not feel like fall into the abyss of despair. In conclusion, althougth not telling a lie is a virtue, we need to learn when should we decorate and pack our words in a little polite way and will not hurt someone's heart stikingly. Therefore, telling a lie can be accepted in some situations.

Spring the best season After freezing days finally we are starting the sping. It means that probably your mood will change, because the sun has a direct effect in our humor. Why don't you think about all good things that has spring? Firstly, I would point out that the day becomes largest. As a result we can do many activities such as walking, meeting, etc. In some countries you can also see free concerts outside and parties. Secondly, there is much color in the streets, because not only the shops are showing colour clothes in their shop windows but also the houses have flouers. Last but not least, we have to pay less bills in spring because we need less light and fire. Therefore, we can spend that money on holidays. In a nushell, I would add that the weather is fabulous, because it is damp, neither not much hot not cool.

it is nothing more important than humans' health nowawadays. However, due to the stress and workload of study and work, coupled with addiction to digital devices, exercise has gradually become less important and neglected. On the topic of whether university students should be forced to do sports or not, I'm fully agree that students need to exercise per week. Firstly, excerecise is an essential activity for our health, which can reduce the probibilty of getting the disease and syndrones about heart, diabetes or blood pressure and other disorders, especially for students who spend their spare time on sedentary activies such as working, doing homeworks, scrolling cellphones, watching TV, and using computers. Hence, mandatory participation in games and other exercises at schools and colleges, can temporarily let students put down their phones, leave their seats, and do outdoor activities, and provide students' bodies with appropriate solutions to maintain their body health. Second, according to some experts' studies in medical field, exercise can also help students have a positive mind and good mood, which can reduce anxiety and depression, and contrarily, increase the motivations to face challenge when students stuck in trouble. For example, if I have had trouble in studies for a while, I feel that I will suffer fromm mental illness from the presuures. Thus, I will try to shift my attentions from studying and compel them out of my brain by exercising. I will do some sprots such as running, table tennis with my friends, which usually gives me some new iedas about studies, gets more motivations for continuing learning, rejuvenate my thoughts, and have better academic performance. So, it can be said that forcing the young ones to partake in healthful activities, is indeed essential. To conclude, wellness, sports and activities are prominent to maintain a good body. In my opinion, the sporting sessions should be mandated around the world, in order to keep tomorrow's adults fit and to assist them in picking up a healthy lifestyle.

Dear Sam, Hope you are in radiant health. I am writing this letter to let you know that I recently attended a musical concert at 'The Sports Club, New Delhi,' and it reminded me of our college days. As you know that I am fond of music, therefore, I planned to attend this musical festival. It was a great show, where various musical bands and singers such as 'The Indian Ocean,' and 'The Big Brothers,' exhibited their performances. Moreover, I loved the concert because of its amazing aura. Although it was a musical festival, there were dance performances by renowned artists namely Malaika Arora, and Ashley Lobo. I would, also, want to tell you that, accidentally, I encountered our common friend 'Les Patterson' at the concert. It was great to meet him after years. As he was enquiring about you, I have shared your contact number and you can soon expect a call from him. Look after yourself and your family. Hope to hear from you soon. Warm regards, Peter

I certainly agree on the fact that young people should do sports, as well as all the people during their life. An active lifestyle has positive effects on anyone, both on the physical health than on mental health. I don't even think that both children than university students should be forced to do three hours of sports per week. I would let the families choose the combination, taking into account a lot of different situations, as well as the different characteristics of their sons. First of all, I think that school should treat gymn as another subject, and should account for it at least two hours per week, but all together, that is to say: students should have time to change clothes, and to have showers afterwards. Two hours together would be enough to have an hour of effective sport or gymn and an hour for changing (equipped bathrooms should be provided in any school). Later on, I suggest that each school should organize extra curriculum courses of sports in order to group those students that are most interested, at a very low extra charge. Finally, families could follow or not the teachers advice of making or not extra courses, depending on their sons ability in the sport itself. In this sense I think that families should have the freedom to choose, also because sometimes they prefer to have children engaged in other activities, like music courses or other community social activities, or simply studying more. For what regards students at the university, finally, I think that they should be absolutely free to choose how to spend their time. They are enough mature to understand if they need or not some physical activity, and the activity could just be a walk in the city park rather than a precise sports activity.

People consider that telling the truth is always beneficial instead of telling lies. However, tell a lie sometimes is acceptable if the lie is not harmful for nobody. For example, Santa Claus existence is told to children to keep their spirit and improve their imagination. The first thing to consider is that people always lie for different reasons. Some lies have sincere intentions of not harming anyone, and some others are the opposite of this. For this reason, white lies are unavoidable for human beings many times to maintain order in society. For instance, tell someone you fell asleep, and that is the reason to arrive late to a meeting, is a lie to avoid memos or penalties.. Hence, that is why the difference between white lies and harmful lies is the key when people say the truth or a lie. Personally, I consider that truth is always important In account of the fact that people’s need to know what happens around them. Whereas, it is also acceptable to tell a lie when the situation requires. To conclude, lies are not an act of evilness when the purpose of the lie is to avoid harm or damage. Therefore, a lie is fair if the purpose of the lie is to protect people from the truth. However, people cannot dis-prestige the importance of the truth to know and grasp crucial events in people's lives.

Dear Sam, Hope you and and your family are in good health. I am so fortunate to find a friend like you, who is undersatnding as well as caring. As you know, I am fond of watching movies, therefore, I would like to share with you the name of my favourite Hollywood film which is 'Eat, Pray and Love' starring 'Julia Roberts.' I, first, saw this picture during my adolescence, and since then it is one of my best liked films. This movie not only delivers a strong message about the importance of loving onseself, but it also motivates the viewers not to give up while facing challenging situations. Since life is uncertain, it is imperative for each one of us to love and nurture ourselves every single day. Also, the last part of the film was shot in Bali, which according to me, is one of the most beautiful places on this planet. As we both have similar preferences, I would want you to watch this film with your family or friends. Although the time duration of this movie is more, it provides an indepth understanding of cultures of several countries namely India, Bali, and Italy. Please stay in touch, and let me know how you feel about the movie. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Peter

Nowadays adolescents and young people tend to be more sedentary than in the past. Health science has proved that an inactive lifestyle can have various bad effects on both mental and physical health. For this reason many governments suggest families to let their children moving as much as they can, for example by introducing it to different kinds of sports. Sports projects are usually joined by schools and universities to introduce young people to new activities, hoping they'll like them and maybe start practice on a regular basis. Personally, I think these programs should be implemented in order to keep students moving. First of all, doing some exercise three times a week is the best way to move your body especially if your main everyday activity involves sitting for many hours over your books. As a matter of fact, students who don't do sports tend to get more distracted and are usually more isolated that others. There's also an higher risk for them to develop a bad posture. Second of all, forcing students to do sports could be helpful for those who struggle making friends. Many lifelong friendships are usually born during adolescence thanks to sports activities. Especially in team sports people tend to create a bond with other players very easily. On the other hand, there are also students who struggle with the idea of moving their bodies. Sometimes, overweighted people are ashamed of their bodies and their difficulties when it comes to move around. For this reason, I would recommend universities and school to pay attention to the necessities of each student before forcing them to do sports. Perhaps they could include a psychological help for young people who feel this is a bad thing for them. All in all, I would say that these programs could be very useful and effective only if carefully applied by considering all the factors and different aptitudes.

Nowadays we have so much opportunities to learn something new about jobs. There are different ways in which we could practice, the one I am talking about is the chance for students to be volunteers. I personally admire this method. There are many reasons behind the fact that this is a good initiative in teenagers life. One of these is to be capable of gaining money while you are studying. By doing this you can decide to save your money to pay your future studies, at university or wherever you will decide to go and do. In addition, it is useful because you learn something about a new job and acquire skills you would have never imagine to have, but above all, you help society by doing little things. In my opinion, this type of volunteering in high school should be spread in other countries, because it can also help students with school difficulties to graduate by simply doing something different that can rebalance their school grades. I am speaking about this because I have seen a lot of movies in which this method is often used and I would have liked to try it when I was a scholar. In conclusion, this is a good move because with one job the opportunity to graduate, help people and gain money are given to the students.

It is an intriguing question: better short but intense life or long but calm and 'grey', and with no bright colors ? I think that, even if it seems hard to decide, at a closer look maybe most people believe that they would prefer a short but intense life. And probably it is mainly for one reason: the intensity of the feelings that a totally involving experience carries on with it, in a special way carries on a time distortion. That is to say, time passes very slowly when you are going throughout a very intense experience. You remember every minute of the time passed, and every minute lasts as a day long. This is a result from the psychology science: the time is not absolute but has a different duration from one to another, with respect to his or her feeling of the time. Our mental processes enhance some situation, and they thus appear longer than other moments of poor mental activity. And those special situations, despite their real duration, are so impressed in our mind that they appear much longer in time, when we think. Finally, we can understand the common phrase "better a day as a lion than one hundred as a ship." It is the sensation of having spent intensively all the time in your hands with no seconds lost, that makes you happier. And we all would like to have a good time. Good time is not more time, but better one.

I have heard about that considering the young people who has the bad habit that may affect there health, the universities and schools had set rules to force students to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. For the sake of strengthing the physical and mental health of students, I agree with this latest policy, and my reasons are follows. Firstly, many students are addicted to their own mobile phones. Although the young people do not have the ability to control them by themselves, most students at school nowadays have their own phone. As a result, a lot of students do not sleep until midnight because of there phones, and it will make them energyless. If the school set rules to force them to do sports it can help them stay away from mobile phones and improve their healthy condition. In addition, it can also enhance students' academic performance. According to a study, the students who doing sports have better scores than those stay in houses. Secondly, doing sports regularly can help the students make more friends, which is beneficial to their mental health. Many sports activities are a kind of test to teamwork, and through the progress of team working, the students can cultivate their ability of cooperating. For example, baskteball, football, soccer, etc. The students can make true friends while they are fighting with their teammates together. After the sports activities they can also discuss the problems they meet with their friends, which is really good for their mental health. Friends are an important company for all sthdents. On the other hand, the schools cannot always force the students to do sports. What is the most important is to make them love doing sports so that the will do the sports activities regularly by themselves instead of others' enforcement. And that is the final purpose. To sum up, in my opinion, it is necessary that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. It could avoid the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle. But enforcement is not the final purpose, the schools should teach them to mix sports into their lives.

When we become adults, life changes forever. And all the things around us change, too. When we are children or teens, we almost always depend on our parents to do everything. We depend on even their money to buy simple things we want, or to go out at weekends' night. So, when we become adults, we need looking for situation which allows us to grow up at every directions. Then, it's very interesting that university students, for example, already start walking by their own resources. Some of them move away and live on their own when they go to university. At same time, there are others who live at home with their family in this periodo of life. I think that after a person get older, it is better for her not depend on anyone. People need to understand that they will not have parent's protection for all whole life. Protection is very good (and even useful) during some years of the childhood and teenage, but there is a moment in which we must learning to guide our own steps, because we won't have other adults to protect us for the rest of our lives. So, I believe that the best choice to university students when they go to University is trying to build their own academic lives for their own. If some extreme need situation happens, these students may ask their father to help them. Pay attention: I said this is acceptable only if occurs extreme need (illness, accident for example). My idea about this has nothing to see with becoming difficult students' lives. Never... my idea is about to do they can see how huge is achieving our goals, and how the real life is hard out of our homes when we are older and we decide having our lifestyle! No always children and teenagers can imagine how heavy is to work and to get things which parents do... It seems even everything our parents acquire fall from the sky. So, may they begin to understand soon that life is difficult, and the first difficulty starts when we go to university!

In my life, I have been studying English for almost twenty years. I sometimes wonder why I am obsessed with learning English. The answer is simple: I still need to learn English. When I started studying English, I was a junior high school student. Since then, I had studied English for three years in junior high school, another three years in high school, and four years in college. During these ten years, I have become able to read English essays with a dictionary. However, I am still not good at speaking and listening in English. Since graduating from the college, I have continued to practise listening to English. Every day, on the commute train to work, I listen to English news, and shadow the news in a whisper. If a simultaneous translation tool became available, I wouldn't need to learn English any more. I hope that day will come in the near future.

It is recommended to be honest in life as it defines the character and moral values of each person. This essay intends to highlight the reasons why I think it is necessary to speak honestly throughout the life. To be honest is an excellent virtue of life, and some people are born with this innate quality, whereas, the others learn this skill from their families, or, teachers. As this quality describes the social image of a peson in society, therefore, it is essential to tell the truth at all circumstances in life. To demonstrate, since I absorbed various moral values such as honesty, and punctuality from my father, it has always helped me to deal with challenging situations in a stronger way. Even though it is hard not to lie during tough times, it is recommended to communicate in an honest way as one can develop a bad habit of lying, which can have several dertrimental effects on individuals, and society. People can, moreover, get involved in several troubles when they cheat on others. To illustrate, a close friend of mine was habitual of speaking lies, which negatively impacted my image in the college, and eventually, I decided to end up my friendship with her. Hence, it is prudent to tell the truth on all occasions as this trait is a building block of one's personality and image in the community. To conclude, it is vital to communicate in a fair and transparent way for the well-being of society. Furthermore, it helps people to be real and natural in their own ways.

Life expectancy is unpredictable and destined. If I was asked to choose between living a long calm life until 100 years old and living a short lifespan but much more intense, interesting, and fatigue, frankly to say, I will choose the former for some reasons below although some people like me in the phase of teenagerse would like to have a tense life now. The first reason why I would prefer to live longer is to learn more knowledge about this world. The world is full of many interesting phenomena and principles, which deeply lures me to observe the change of the world with respects to politics, economy, artistic, science, cultures, etc. Besides, the process of change of knowledge and cultural and scientific phenomena may last so long that I have much time to learn much more about the principle of this world than the ordinary if I could live up to 100 years old. Additionally, the second reason why I prefer to live longer is related to my characteristics. I'm a little conservative, quiet, and slow-paced person compared to most of my peers so that I'm usually inclined to live in a slow tone of life like taking a stroll on the road for one afternoon, sitting on the balcony leisurely and seeing the pedestrians crossing by the roads, and having a tasty drinks in a coffee shop while reading the traveling magazines. Moreover, the most critical reasons for me to choose live longer is my lovely family. If I have my ownw family, I 'm eager to accompany with my dad, my mom, spouse, wife, children as long as I can. I would like to spend my rest of time taking care of them, watching them growing healthily, and allowing them to have their own families finally, which is the biggest satification for my life. In general, after considering the above benefits compared to living in a short lifespan, I would prefer to live longer even though it may not be imaginable in my destiny.

Nowadays, I'm working in the office that is in a building on the 12º floor. I always work there, I feel really anxious because it seems there won't be way to leave, get out of that room. Besides that, when it doesn't have any energy to support you, you'll have to down the stars. It would be terrible, mainly if you work in the higher floor kind of 12º like me. How that space isn't so big, you'll have to allow for all the employee who works in that tiny place. In order to remove or increase the sounds, you'll have to create walls, that is, you'll speand more money if your company has a great deal of employee. An example, in my work, when someone tries to get in touch with other people by telephone or video chat, they need to change the room to reduce the sound so that all the sounds, mainly other subjects, are not received by person across the vídeo or the line. There's another problem who no one is telling is about the privacy. It depends on the meeting or subject, but if you need to talk a specific thing to another person such as you are firing someone or you are talking about money, you won't have any privacy to talk about. All of it is owing to lack of privacy that they don't have when they created the office.

In my opinion, always telling the truth is one of the fundamental ways to make and keep a good relationship with others. Even though everyone feels good to tell a lie it is not good, because they must feel worthy when they notice it is not true. To apologize when you miss something is also important. People are not perfect. It is usual to make sometimes mistakes. So to apologize for the mistakes and how to recover them is very important. On business, always telling the truth and apologizing are more important to building and keeping a good relationship with a customer, because businesspeople always have a responsibility for something and they do not want to fail their jobs. So they have to build and keep a good relationship with customers based on them. Even though there are difficulties on your business, it becomes easier once you can get a good relationship to continue to tell the truth and apologize for a mistake and recover it. Personally, I think that a good relationship makes people feel worth living and people are a member of a group. People may always think about their worth and meaning to live. So it is very important for people to feel them. For the above the reason, I always think that always telling the truth is very important and the key to making good relationships with others and making a better life.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing regarding the new policy of the administration which restricts the usage of cellular phones on public forms of transport such as buses, and metro trains as well as in public stores and eateries. Since the above news was published in the local newspaper, 'The Navbharat Times,' on 18th February 2022, I believe, it is both my right and duty to convey to the local authority of Noida that as a representative of this town, I am dissatified with the idea of making alterations in the existing policy of mobile usage. As per my understanding, if the local body makes any changes in the current system pertaining to the utilization of smart phones, it will lead to several detrimental effects on individuals and society. To commence with, since we all are aware of the fact that mobile phones have become a necessity in our lives because it not only does provides us with the opportunity to speak with our family and friends, but it also helps people to track their loved ones, particularly, the elderly and children of their family, therefore, the usage of cell phones cannot be restricted in terms of places and time. Secondly, people listen to music and read articles, or news on their phones while using public conveyance, which helps them to relax as well as to be aware of their surroundings, and, if the management makes the decision of altering the cellular phone policy, it will affect the common man negatively in various ways. Considering the above-mentioned situations, I request you to please reconsider your plan of making variations in the present guidelines of using cell phones on public transport and areas of common interest. Looking forward to receiving a positive response. Yours faithfully, Ben Peterson

Health is the most important thing in our life. Therefore, there is a proverb " Health is wealth " . There are many reasons why I say this. Many people might think that wealth is better than health. So, they try to be wealthy. In fact, sometimes, they forget to take care of their health. They ingore it instead of taking care of this. Because they think it is not very important and so they neglect it. On the other hand, they forget they cannot do nothing if they are ill. They can't go wherever they want. Besides that, they can't eat what they like, and they can't work too. At that time, some people realize that health is important. To sum up, we need to take care of our health. If so, we can live more happily even though we are not wealthy. Thus, I totally agree that it is more important to be healthy than to be wealthy.

Health, indeed, plays an important role in the life of all. In the contemporary era, youngsters, particularly the undergraduates, and students studying in schools are seen consuming fast food on a regular basis, and following an unenergetic style of living, which leads to several detrimental effects on their well-being and fitness levels. This essay intends to describe how health, and wellness can be maintained by adopting a healthy, and an active routine. Moreover, it emphasizes the role of exercise and physical activities in improving the quality of life, hence, I concur with the idea that the youngsters should be urged to perform physical exercise a minimum of three times a week. As students are the future of our country, therefore, not only should they look after their physical health, but should also maintain their mental well-being. Playing outdoor games such as cricket, and tennis, or performing physical exercises namely yoga, aerobics, and running can help youth be energetic and overcome several health-related problems. To begin with, it helps children to be active and full of energy throughout the day. As a result, they do not feel lethargic while studying, moreover, they look forward to performing their daily tasks with enthusiasm and ardour. To illustrate, because I started to exercise in my childhood, I lost the excess body weight, and, furthermore, I was able to concentrate better on my academics and score higher grades. Another reason why a healthy physical routine is important is because it assists youngsters to overpower health-related challenges namely obesity, diabetes, and asthma. Furthermore, in comparison to medicines, exercise is a better way to build immunity and fight against diseases. For example, a recent study by Times has revealed that 70% of people suffering from diabetes can be cured if they imbibe a nutritious diet and perform physical activities an average of three times per week. Thus, sports as well as physical training plays a key role in the lives of youth. To conclude, it is undeniably true that playing outdoor sports and performing physical exercise can support youth to overcome their health problems as well as to focus on their academic career in a better way. In my view, to exercise is a great way to boost immunity; in fact, it is the best way to be physically and mentally fit.

As life is important to all, there are some individuals who prefer life to be short and full of energy as well as intensity, whereas, the other class of individuals believe to live a long, and peaceful life. This essay intends to highlight the reasons why I think a serene and a calm approach is integral to living a healthy and long-lasting life. In the contemporary era, people not only are seen running after money and wealth, but are also seen becoming competitive against each other, particularly, against their friends and family members. As a result, they let go of their relationship and friendship with their near and dear ones as they give more priority to their economic status in society. Therefore, it is sensible to live in a serene environment such as in the countryside, where people show respect and gratitude towards each other. Furthermore, this helps them to develop stronger bonding among themselves and to help one another during emergencies. To illustrate, since my parents lived in a small town, they believed in simplicity of life and valued their relationships with others. Moreover, they learned to be contented in their lives, and not to become money-minded. Secondly, adopting a calm and peaceful lifestyle helps individuals and society to be healthy in terms of their physical and mental well-being, and to enjoy a long-lasting life. In my understanding, it is better to live a stress-free life because stress, and anxiety are the two main factors for all types of health-related problems namely heart attacks, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels. For example, a recent study by Times has revealed that 70% of youth living in the metropolitan areas are suffering from hypertension due to their intense and busy lifestyle. Thus, it is important for people to adopt a passive lifestyle, which is beneficial for their health, and life. To conclude, as a complex and intense lifestyle could lead to several detrimental effects such as health and social problems in society, therefore, it is prudent to adopt a passive lifestyle to safeguard the interest of human race.

Obesity is a big headache for public health and it is necessary to educate people about this matter. However, forcing people to do exercise could be counterproductive. First of all, we must encourage a more active lifestyle and introduce a subject in school and Universities seem to be the right choice. Younger generations will be more educated about their health and, as a consequence, could raise awareness among their family members and everyone will benefit. But, at the same time, forcing young people to do exercise when they do not want to, or feel embarrassed about it, could create a different impact: generate distance on physical activity. Kids and young people are ruthless and not everyone is good at sports. We must be careful because bullying is also a big public issue in our schools. We do not want to create another issue in our schools. I think we should encourage a healthier lifestyle for children and university students, but this cannot be done by forcing sports activity. We should find different ways to transform sport into an attractive activity and, as a consequence, have a healthy lifestyle. Increasing college credits for those who do sports in schools could be a great advantage, for example. Another example could be to change the type of food we give to children in school casinos for a healthier one, this would help to change habits in children, try and get to know new foods. As for college students, I can think of having healthy casinos and restaurants on campus, offer a variety of cheap and fast healthy food for them. Another idea that comes to my mind is reducing college debt fees for those who have played some kind of sport during their college years, that could motivate sports activity among students. There are many ways to awareness of a more healthy lifestyle for young people, forcing sports shouldn't be one of them.

What I most enjoyed about the trip it was when the teacher, who have it in for me, fell off the canoe, It was so funny and they all laughed it.

My reasons for learning English are first to obtain an international job where I could speak English full time because my current job is a joke, they require a bilingual engineer but you never talked in English and my manager, I guess, really doesn't talk in English. Second, English is talk around the world and when I travelled to Europe I used my English and I felt confident and learned some words to use in the correct way. Three English is Simple and you can learn faster. Four When you understand English you can expand your entertainment for example right now I could watch movies and series in English because Netflix does not post in Colombia only in the USA or launches series in other countries and not Colombia.

Computers and tablets could be implemented at school. Nowadays, teaching at university and school is been changing. In my view It had better implementing new forms that manteinning traditional methods. Educators have to implement mesuares in order to adapt to our present. In addition, if studyents are using computers and tablets at home in order to learn, why couldn't they use at class? Furthermore, it isn't worth memorizing a lot of knowledge that you can find on the internet. It is high time educators takled this problem, and they would have to change their mind. As a result, it would meant to invest more money in new desvices, although it would be cheap in the future. But on the other hand, eductors would have more work in class if they had to control the use of the internet at class. To sum up, in my view is vital to renew some rules at school.

Autumn is my favourite season of the year. And it's not only because my birthday is in September! I always had a deep connexion with nature. It's the beginning of the end, the start of the cold days, the opening of the Christmas days season and the new things to come. In Autumn, in France, we begin the new academic year, so it's the moment to think about your future, and your dreams, and prepare to achieve your goals and ambitions. Autumn means the fall of golden and brown leaves, the tiredness of animals preparing for the hard season coming, the world slowing down, the trees revealing their naked trunks the leafy clothes which fly away. It's the time to spleen, to dream, to walk alone and play in the wind. Memories of past years come harder in this period, often memories from our childhood or our young teenage years. For me, autumn is deeply linked to faeries and the magic world. These days I dream of being a fox or a wolf, and wandering in a forest, in search of a little door from the magic land.

Dear Chris, It was overwhelming to hear that you could come along with my family to the museum. We will get transported there by car. Be aware that the car ride will be 50-60 minutes long. You can find plenty of interesting things at the museum. For example, you can see ancient fossils, learn about animals and their life cycles, guess if they are mammels or reptiles. Additionally, you can also find out if they are warm-blooded animals or cold-blooded animals. You will need to bring a plastic bag, your jacket, a notebook along with a pencil. That would be everything that will come in handy. I predict that we will have such a brilliant day spending time with each other! Kind regards, George Dishwasher

All-time is important to learn to speak a foreign language no matter whether it was in the past, present, or future. If you had a second language, you had had a different perspective on life, because when you learn a new language you really need involved in culture to understand idioms, know people, the village customs and other advantages. I guess in the past learning a new language maybe was difficult because only the high elite class of the king have professors or classes to learn things, but if you were poor maybe you acquire a new language escape of your town and face the life in a place where you did not have any idea or how you communicate, but when you learn thing for you own way almost all case you have more knowledge to face a test or improve your quality of life and open new opportunities

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I don’t think so. Of course, tablets and computers are very useful. Think about it, all your notes and your information are in the cloud or on your computer. All our data one way or another is partially or completely in the computer’s memory. But they will completely replace books made paper I doubt it. Because the books you can read any time, any place include without electrical energy. You can make your notes in your books, so simple, just write. The advantage no one can see your notes and your notebook does not need upgrade constantly. Anyway, in my opinion, the best of reading books is that they don’t hurt your eyes. If you read the screen after a few hours your eyes will hurt. Never do my eyes hurt when I read a book, obviously with adequate light.

My reasons for learning English I have three reasons for learning English. First of all, there are many authors whose works are not translated into Spanish but into English. Especially Greek, Roman, and European. For another hand, American doctrinal authors are very important to read. Secondly, I love travelling to United Stated and hearing the people speak, answering the questions of the migrations police, going to McDonald’s and asking for an order of hamburgers, potato chips, and cold Coke, and walking, walking seeing the advertising. I forget, I like to watch a tv shows in English. For some reason, I like that. In third place, I hope someday in the future to work for a foreign university online. I know a lot about Kelsen’s theory of law. I know maybe is a silly idea, but who knows. I hope one day to teach online about this author.

write and improve is a fantastic application to improve my English I have been used for 4 mounts this time I completed one workbook at the beginner level and that was enjoyable because I remember all my grammar classes and now I do workbooks at the intermediate level and I can say my confidence when I talk and write English content more fluent and not use a dictionary every time. However, write and improve application could improve its functions and feedback to users because no native speaker can identify the differences between American or British English, and this platform only has British English maybe the student could select which language the application show menus and IA to correct activities. for lack of money I don't use a PRO mode or VIP mode maybe when you have a guide like a teacher feedback will have more information but in my opinion, it's not necessary if you have classes, Obviously I recommend write and improve it's free and really you can feel and watch your progress

Hey Sammie! What is your favourite movie? Mine is "Pirates of the Caribbean"! I know, it is a really famous one. But everything in the first opus is so amazing! The costumes, for the beginning! Have you seen their costumes? Since I've watched this movie, I have had an obsession with the 18e period! Especially the costume of Jack, the main character - and so far my favourite -! Secondly, the story plot! It's basic but so entertaining! There are puns and jokes at every single moment. And, last but not least, the actors and actresses! The casting is so wonderful! Orlando Bloom as a young dumb smith. Keira Knightley as a brave and fighting aristocrat. Johnny Deep as... himself, but in a pirate way! A bunch of marvellous actors for a marvellous movie ! (I didn't like the next opuses !) I'm sure you will like this movie, dude. You like action and history, adventure tales and all that pirate stuff, and above all, you're in love with Keira!

Hey Jimmy! Last week, I went to a concert. And, believe me, it was fantastic! It was Indochine who performed, and they were marvellous! When I saw, three months ago, that they have to produce near to my town, I didn't wait a minute more and rushed to their website to buy tickets! It was pretty expensive, but as they're an old group, I think it will be one of their last tours, and as they're my favourite band, I have to see them before. Do you know Indochine? I'm sure you do! It's a French pop-rock band. They are old because they debuted in the 80s. Nikola Sirkis is the leader, the creator and the main singer-composer of the band. He mostly writes about political and controversial topics, like sex, racism, homophobia, and non-binarity... It's why I'm such a fan! So, during the concert, I was a little disappointed by Nikola's voice (the singer and leader.). But, as he's 65, I forgive him easily. The other members were so good, and the show was incredible. They are known in France to be stage animals, and now I can confirm this!

There is no shortage of opinion on educational methods. Some people believe digital devices, such as computers or tablets, should be used instead of paper books in schools and universities. As far as my perspective is concerned, I agree with this statement. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. In this regard, I will discuss how new educational instruments could contribute to a better educational comprehension; and also, how it would have significant impacts on protection of the environment. The aforementioned justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, technology have constructive results on quality of education. By using new devices, like tablets, students can have a great access to various databases whilst they are attended in a class room. These databases can provide students with holistic information on every possible topic that could be presented by a lecturer at a class room. If they had not had this possibility to use such useful appliances at a classroom, they would have been deprived of an opportunity to gain deep and asymmetric knowledge of issues. Besides, these instruments make the teaching process more accurate and comprehensive. In other words, learning through new tools presents better pedagogical outcomes. Secondly, a shift from using traditional books to take advantages of new digital devices means that the number of tree should be cut every year to produce books, will be lessen dramatically. In other words, if we increased the number of the electronic devices in schools or universities, it would result in a fact in which we will consume less papers. This fact reveals that there is a negative correlation between this two things: more digital devices, less tree should be eradicated. Therefore, this policy has a positive environmental effect in itself. To put in a nutshell, any replacement between paper books and digital devices should be considered as a fruitful decision. As I explained above, I fully support this idea. In this regard, I discussed how this measure would make teaching more easy and learning more beneficial. Moreover, I stated that this policy would have environmental impacts which is indispensable. Consequently, in my personal point of view, books should be replaced with new tablets and computers.

It goes without saying that the impact of video games on children's lifestyle has been significant, and it is something parents need to learn how to deal with. My thoughts about that matter are going to be displayed in this writing. When it comes to new technology, there is no doubt it has a great impact on our current lifestyle. For better or worse, we all live in a technological world, where video games have an important role, especially among children. No wonders, there must be some beneficial effects on children the fact that they get to control such devices. However, the negative impact, in my humble opinion, should not be underestimated. To start with, I would like to mention some positive aspects of that matter. The way I see it, video games can provide children with technological knowledge. For instance, video games set in a specific historical moment can teach them how life was at that moment, and all the events that occurred. Nevertheless, it is a fact that other topics less productive are normally chosen when it comes to playing, such as war or racing. On the other hand, the overuse of video games and technological devices, in general, is making children lose their social skills and, what is more, it creates addiction. Besides, in accordance with some studies, playing video games is replacing face to face contact. Had it not been for that last point, it would not be wrong to think that video games can be productive for children. Nevertheless, the reality is very different. Children spend more time on their own and playing video games than they actually do with real people like their parents or friends. Last but by no means least, I would end up by bringing focus to the fact that, even though we cannot live refusing technology and how relevant it is in the current world, parents ought to control what their kids do and how much time they spend doing so.

There is no debate on the utmost importance of practical knowledge in different languages. Almost all persons believe that nowadays, the ability to communicate in at least on language other than the native language is indispensable. From my personal perspective, I agree with this statement. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. Speaking foreign languages is essential to find a prestigious job; and also, it is a useful mean to converse with people all around the world. These aforementioned justifications will be elaborated more in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, the world business is an inter-related phenomenon and should you thought to have a world-class market, you would have to interact with foreigners. In addition, no one can dismiss the fact that the current level of import or export, in an international sphere, requires actors to command multi-languages. On the other hand, when it comes to individuals, the same is true. It has been shown by the scientific statistics that those who know more than two languages, have a significant opportunity to find jobs with higher wages. Hence, ability to speak different languages seems to be inevitable. Secondly, there are numerous languages in the world. Should you knew more, you would be able to make more bond and friendships. Besides, knowing various languages, other than a maternal tongue, contributes to your ability to travel all around the world and discover things and gain unbelievable unprecedented experiences. Therefore, by speaking to a second or third language, you will be able to discover many new places by your own. Otherwise, if one does not consider it as an impossible, it would be so hard to travel abroad. To put in a nutshell, language has become a necessary instrument to make relations, to find a better job, and even enjoy your life. With the current trajectory in international relations among States and nations, capability to have a high degree of proficiency in different languages, such as English, is vital. In this essay, I delineated two explanations in which the necessity of foreign languages is proven. Not only job prospects make it as a prerequisite for a professional career, but also, ordinary communication with people around the world, through social networks for instance, will not be possible without.

There is no shortage of opinion on prosperity or happiness. In this regard, there is a famous dilemma on whether health or wealth has a priority over the other. From my personal perspective, I invariably opt for health. This is my firm belief based on two plausible reasons. In this essay I will explain how health is important; and also, I will draw attention to drawbacks of wealth. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, health, either mental or physical, is the most valuable gift in a life. Without having a healthy body, no one can enjoy his or her life. In addition, to the extent that you benefit from health, you can flourish other aspects of your life. Should you had a healthy life, then you would be able to foster your talents, including in sport or even in your academic career. Therefore, health has a great contribution in life and will be resulted in a better performance in any other field. Without health, you probably have to consume a considerable amount of energy, financially or mentally, to regain your favourable condition. Secondly, wealth is important but there is always a limit. Money has its own negative and positive consequences. Although its positive impacts are prevailing the cons, still there are some disadvantages. For instance, a great amount of money will lead to anxiety. The scientists have been scrutinizing the repercussions of wealth on mental health. The result of their survey was significant and unbelievable. It has been observed by the psychological experts that money has ramifications on mental health as it contributes to higher degree of distress. Thus, money or financial independence is something that everyone try to reach at. Nevertheless, it is not impeccable and may raise unintended problems. To put in a nutshell, Health is more important than wealth. If you have money without a healthy mind or body, you will have no choice but to spend your money to recuperate yourself. In this essay, I tried to demonstrate certain issues that prove the significance of health vis-a-vis wealth. I discussed the effects of health, as a general, to enjoy a happy life and to flourish a vast range of traits. Moreover, I delineated some ramifications of wealth on human's health. For sake of a conclusion, I would like to emphasize that health is the vital to benefit from life.

There is no shortage of opinion on negative or positive impacts of television. In this regard, many people are of the opinion that TV programs can be useful to learn new things, alongside the fact that it is mostly for entertainment. From my personal perspective, I agree with this statement. In this essay, I will discuss that TV programs can deliver shows in which pedagogical units of schools could be covered. Also, I will delineate that the television has a great influence on children who can learn many new things from its programs. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, the great majority of television's audiences are youngsters who are students at schools. In addition, it has been reckoned that pupils pass three hours per day to watch TV programs. Thus, there is a significant opportunity available to authorities in order to take the most possible advantage of this situation. Should pedagogical complementary multimedia units had been delivered through TV programs, students would have been encouraged to spend their times more on fruitful programs. Therefore, television could be employed as a mean to broadcast certain teaching courses in an intricate and effective manner. Secondly, pupils are fascinated by TV. The scientists have been pondering the influence of TV broadcasting programs on youngsters, and the result reveals that materials broadcasted by television lingers for more period of time vis-a-vis those which were presented through traditional schools' classes. In this regard, if TV used as a mean to develop students' knowledge on matters related to their course, they would face with a situation in which they can deepen their understandings about relevant issues that could not be developed at schools. Hence, we can exploit kid's interests toward television, to provide them with comprehensive and conclusive information related to their courses. To put in a nutshell, TV can provide amusement, as well as, education. In this essay, I examined the possibility to use TV as an instrument to teach kids in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, I articulated the fact that young people who are attending schools can have a profound enthusiasm to follow certain teaching lessons through TV programs. Consequently, the utmost effectiveness of television should not be neglected. TV could crack open an opportunity to provide young people with essential pedagogical programs in a manner that appears to be more favorable to them.

Which is more important: health or assets? This is a very difficult question. In the first place, are the two comparable? I cannot choose one or the other. I need both. I am greedy. On one hand, even if I alone am healthy, I will not be happy. I have a family and I want to protect their health. To do that, I need some assets. In today's society, it costs money just to go to the hospital. On the other hand, even if I have assets, I cannot enjoy them if I am not healthy. For example, if I was bedridden, it would make no difference whether I have assets or not. Health cannot be bought with money. After all, health and assets are probably not two separate issues. Health is a prerequisite for utilising assets and assets are a prerequisite for a healthy life. Hence I want both health and wealth.

When I was taking a technical course, me and other students were in charge of choosing a place for us to go and dog rescue center, which we called a kennel. After the choice we had to get there on foot, because we didn't have a car that would allow us to get there quickly. After a long walk we warrived at the kennel, which was near a hill, when we arrived at the place we delivered rations and cleaning materials to clean the kennel. The part that I liked the most was the walk, even though it was very tiring, it was also a lot of fun.

Hello Alex! Thank you so much for inviting me to your party this Saturday! I really appreciate it, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go this time, I know you were excited about this party so please accept my apologies, The reason why I can't go is because, I have to leave to the airport to catch a flight to Canada to visit my grandmother for her birthday, I haven't visited her for 3 years, so I figured I could make it to her birthday this year, to finally be able to get her a prsent and celebrate with her, and since the flight is really early I won't be able to go since your party is in the Afternoon, and not earlier. I'm very sorry I can't make it to your party, and I want to make it up to you, so I suggest another day when we could meet, a day when we are both free and able to talk properly to each other without any events in the way. I hope you can forgive me for not going to your party, and that you take into consideration my suggestion. I hope to see you very soon, bye!

Hi Alex how are you? Hope you are great! I'm sorry to say I won't be able to go to the party we arranged this Saturday afternoon because I already have an appointment with my mother. As you probability known, I lived with my family in Ipatinga, Minas Gerais before moving to Campinas, São Paulo. It's been a long time since I arrived in this city, about 6 months, and I miss my family so much. For that reason, I'm going to visit my family this Friday and I'll stay there for about 14 days. In Minas Gerais there are many typical dishes, such as hominy, rice pudding and beans with pork. If you want I can bring some of these foods, I'm sure you'll like Minas Gerais food. I plan to come back in two weeks on Monday, if you don't have any commitments why don't we go to the movies?

Hi, Alex, I'm so sorry but I'm not going to make it to your party this Saturday. My flight was set up for Fiday but the company canceled and I had everything sorted out but I couldn't book another flight on time, the other ones available are on Sunday. There is another company which has a flight on Friday at 8 AM but it's way too expensive for me, I can't afford it. Recently, I've been in a car accident and I was feeling a lot of pain in my back and I went to a doctor's appointment and it happened to be a severe injury and I need to rest for my full recovery, that means no parties for me for a really long time, I hope you accept my sincere apologies. However, when all this ends, I would love to meet and catch up with you, we could meet on July 18th, by then I would probably be feeling way better than right now, I hope you understand, see you soon!

Hi Alex, I really appreciated your invitation to next Saturday party and I know how much you care about it, but I have to decline it. I am very sorry but I had a hitch, so I won't come. My boyfriend's parents decided come to Pisa for the weekend and my boyfriend wants to introduce me to them, so he invited for the occasion all of us to a dinner at his place. I've never met his parents before and I don't want to give them a bad impression about me, so I can't miss that dinner. We could meet on Sunday afternoon. I'll be in the city centre to do some shopping and I'd be very pleased if you decided to join me. To apologise and be forgiven, may I promise I will offer to you an ice cream? I know you can't resist an ice cream, you love them. Plus it's so hot outside these days, isn'it? Let me know, Lovely Susy

From: me To: Alex Subject: Party on Saturday My dear friend, I am sending this e-mail to you only to thank you for the invitation to the party next Saturday. You are a great friend, we know ourselves there are many, many years, and I also know that you would never forget to invite me to this important moment. We are almost brothers, and I know that this event is important to you. Although this, I am using this virtual space to say that I will not stay present at this important moment of your life. Please, forgive me, because I even would like to participate in this moment by your side. I'm so sorry for this, and I will explain the reason I will not be there, and I hope you understand me... During this year, in almost weekends, I had been in several parties (including four or five with you, right?). However, since last month I decided to dedicate part of my life in learning about money. I am learning financial education, and now this is my passion. I have demonstrated a great interest in it. I have classes on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, usually at night (two hours each class, at 7:00 p.m.). So, it will be impossible to stay in your party. These classes are very important, because they are changing my point of view on money, finances, emotional intelligence, personal growing and several other essays which can change our lives forever. I bought classes for an entire year, and their prices were so high. We can say that it was an investment to my life. My focus at this moment is acquiring my financial freedom, because I intend to retire when I will be 45. I know this may not justify my absence in your event, but I hope you forgive me. Soon, I will be free again to stay in other events, and I want you comprehend me. It means that, for a while, I don't have any idea about what will be the next opportunity to stay in this kind of event. Please, forgive me, my friend. I sincerely hope that you might be successful in your event next Saturday. Best regards,

Dear Alex: About that meeting, Umm, I'm sorry I couldn't come. Because my mom doesn't want to play outside, she said that this is the time of the year I graduate, and I must stay at home to learn more to be ready for the graduational task. We are all sixth graders, and this task is necessary our whole lives. My mom doesn't want me out; if I come out, she'll kill me! So, I'm so sorry, but I can't come. Would you like it if we had a party later? My mom said that when we finish our task, she'll be happy to welcome all of you to our house to have a party! But it has to be after the lesson. Would you mind coming? I'll get all our classmates and teachers. Maybe on June 17th? Are you ok with that? If so, just please let me know. Reply soon! your friend

It is of the utmost importance to be a trustworthy person. The majority of people believe that on no account should someone tell a lie. From my personal perspective, I confirm the aforementioned statement. This is my firm belief, based on two plausible reasons. In this essay, I will explore the main advantages of telling truth. Furthermore, I will denote how a lie could ruin credibility of an individual. These justifications will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, honesty is one of the significant traits. In all cultures, religious and cults, being honest is robustly recommended. Furthermore, all poets, social thinkers, as well as philosophers highlights the necessity of telling truth. Importantly, they delineate that this general rule has no exception. In other words, under no circumstances, should the truth be dismissed. If someone had concealed a truth, they would have continued to add lies in order to prove the primary fallacious statement. Therefore, as it has been mentioned in Quran, the holy book of Muslims. Salvation is nothing but in truth. Hence, by telling truth, you may help yourself to go through difficult situations. Secondly, lies can destroy the reliability of a person. It is highly accepted as a social norm that decent people, who are eagerly believe in their integrity, avoid telling something groundless. To make it less grandly, if an individual deliberately made an erroneous claim or distorted a fact, or intentionally tried to cover an act up, whatever it could be, his or her authenticity would be damaged, as the truth will finally reveal itself. If it is the case, on the similar situations, even with insisting on truth, barely it will be feasible for audiences to trust an infamous liar. Thus, never do we have to invoke to misinformation. To conclude, truth will invariably prevail in all possible conditions. It is like a shed light which eradicate the darkness of lies. Accordingly, no one can hide a lie for a long period. Consequently, we will always adhere to truth in order to be an honest person and to keep ourselves credible in the eyes of our relatives.

Hey Alex, Thank you for your invitation. I wish I could come to this party to meet our friends. It's very long since graduating day we have not had any opportunities to meet each other.

First crucial business is the making process for closing my company in Vietnam because finally, I decided to settle down for my family in America. Although I will be unable to come there, I still want to contribute some money for our class's fund and thank you to say 'hi' to everyone and talk to them about my absence.

Dear Alex, Thank you very much for inviting me to your birthday party. I still recall your last birthday celebration, and this was a mesmerizing occasion to meet your friends and family. I wish you a pleased birthday. Unfortunately, due to an important official meeting, I won’t be able to make it. I cannot believe how fast time goes by. Your last birthday occasion seems to have been just a few months ago! I wish I could have also been present to wish you your birthday in person this year. Unfortunately, my office will hold an annual board meeting that usually takes the whole day. We invite some key personnel to the discussion; my presence is significant considering my role. There is no way I can skip the meeting or leave early. Regrettably, your birthday is on the same day. However, I would like to meet you next Saturday and give you your birthday gift. So save my birthday cake until then. I look forward to meeting you soon and wish you a delightful birthday. Yours, Mahtab

So, I am writing this email because I am sorry about my absence in this party and,I am not able to be present in this day. As well as, the main reason I can't attend the gathering is that I will accompany a patient in the hospital at the same day and time and it is a huge coincidence. Finally, I know it is important this party for you and, I am not able to be present, other than I would like to suggest meet each other next week to keep up to date our lives and having some drink.

There is no shortage of opinion on negative lifestyles. Many people believe that due to the harmful impacts of sedentary on mankind well-beings, all educational institutions, including universities and schools, must make physical exercise compulsory. The proponents of this idea recommend that these sportive activities should be taken on every other day. From a personal point of view, I agree with the above-mentioned statements. In fact, this is my firm belief, which I will provide two plausible reasons to prove my perspective. Firstly, I will address the negative ramifications of inactive lifestyles on health from a scientific context. Secondly, I will explore the benefits of an active lifestyle on mental robustness. All the aforementioned will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. To begin with, undoubtedly, there are severe consequences on health which are driven from a sedentary lifestyle. In other words, our methods of living will directly affect our medical conditions. It has been established through certain empirical researches that people who are not active during day, are at stake of chronical physical conditions. For instance, if exercise has been eliminated from your daily schedule, you would plague with heart diseases. These medical disorders are in negative correlation with the extent of physical activates. Thus, if someone had been seated for a long time, in a long run, he would have gotten physical abnormalities. Therefore, doing sport and dedication to have an active lifestyle is associated with health-strength. Secondly, on no account should we consider the impacts of sedentary limited to medical health. Its effect and consequences are beyond. Apparently, sedentary lifestyle has significant effects on mental health. The statistic findings delineate that those who benefit from vacancies in which they have to be active, for example police officers or doctors who should invariably be rush on their foot, feel happier than others with sitting jobs. In other words, you will feel more enthusiasm in your life if you allocate more time on physical activities, regardless of the purpose and nature of the activity. In this regard, one may accentuate on the relations between physical and mental health and well-beings. It should be noted, however, we do not know a great deal about the exact interaction between body and mental health. Nevertheless, their importance and their mutual effects are undeniable. In conclusion, having a healthy life is rooted in our approach towards our life. One of the predominant examples is the effect of sport, physical activities and exercise on both mental robustness and medical condition. According to this fact and based on the presented justifications, which has been explained in the paragraphs above, relevant authorities should take all necessary measure in order to mitigate severe outcomes of a hectic but inactive lifestyle. In this regard, educational complexes, such as universities, could provide certain measures to adequately address this problem.

Hi Alex, Thanks so much for the party invitation! I am pretty sure it will be a huge atmosphere and a lot of fun! Sadly, I will not be able to come, thus, please accept my apologies beforehand. I already booked accommodation for this Saturday night, in Brașov, as me and my work colleagues are participating in a 30 km. Marathon, over the small Jepi mountains. You know I am a big fan of such outdoor activities, I couldn't miss the chance to take part in such a challenging event. Since this weekend is fully booked, I cannot make up for my absence, but... how about Friday evening? Do you have anything planned for? I heard there will be settling down a vintage clothes exhibition at the Friends shop, near to the main square. Why not going to have a look, maybe we'll find something attractive through all those pieces. Afterwards, we can catch up while having a long walk, along the city centre. Can't wait to hear how the party went and what presents did you get. Let me know if my proposal suits you, or we shall arrange another time to see us. Big kisses!

I almost support that computers should replace books in schools and universities. At the present time, information technology and computers are increasing highly. Scientists and inventors always make attempt of learning more about technology due to its excitement and change of the world. In terms of laziness, nowadays humans are being couch potato and don't want to go outdoors. Neither people have a drink nor read books in the library. However, they decide to put their feet up, go to the Internet and read books online instead. As far as I know, it's an advantage of not have to pay any charge when we read books in the internet at home. That's extremely comfortable and convenient for people who aren't diligent! In addition to this problem, it's tremendously bad for humans' health as long as they'll be harmful to their eyes to take lots of time only to look at the computer screen. Come to the end, try to read books online only if you're extremely busy with work. You should spend more time on library to relax your mind and change of scenery to read books.

Hey, Alex, how are you doing? Unfortunately, I will not be able to go to your party on Saturday. My boss called me this morning to a business trip. I told him that I had other important things to do, but he insisted that I was the only one who is really prepared for the trip, since I am the chief of my department. I tried many times to argue with him; however, my boss did not fall for my arguments. I am really sorry for not going to your party, but I will be back from the trip next Wednesday, so we can meet next week in case you have some free time. I am also thinking of throwing a party to make it up to you, it will be amazing, I am sure of it! I hope you have a great time at the party, see you around!

Hi Alex! How are you? I'm sending you a message to prevent you I will not be able to go to your party this Saturday afternoon. I'm sorry. I apologize. Please, don't be mad at me, and let me explain why: Firstly, I have some important school work to do for Monday, and it will take me all the weekend to achieve it, trust me! Secondly, my mother is sick these days. She can't take care of my siblings correctly, so it's why I prefer to stay home and help them. (And it will not be an easy task !) I know we're all expecting this party for weeks, and I pray you forgive me for this unexpected cancellation from me. But, you know, I always have a solution: In two weeks, it will be the summer holiday. Do you want us to organize a big party to celebrate the end of the year? We can plan to do it after our last classes. Are you free on Friday, the 22nd of June ? What do you think about it? Will you forgive me for this Saturday? Have a good week, Your dear friend, Sammie

Dear Alex Thank you for your invitaion to your party this Saturday. But I apologise to you that I can't go to the party. In fact, I will move house in that day. I didn't tell you and also my all friends, I had planned to move from the house I'm living now to a house that is next to five houses. I didn't say because it's too close moving. We will start to move from 9:00 AM the day and plan to finish that at around 18:00 PM. It's short moving but there are lots of furniture, so it would take so long time. Besides, we don't ask moving company to move for this time. So we have to finish moving house by power of only our family. You know, my family has many women. Mothe, my big sister and two small sisters. In the other hand, men are onlyl my father and me. So my father and I will carry veavy furniture like beds, desks, and refrige and so on over the day. If you are OK, can I go to your home next Sunday? I will bring you a present to make up this time.

My suggestions are that when you are writing whatever it is you cannot indentify what you have wrong, that is, when you are reviewing your report once you get your errors you can see some suggestions but more accurately you could not see what your errors are, that is something I would like to change in the system. I also have to say the system is very good for those who are not native English speakers and want to spend their time improving his grammar skill and discovering new ways of writing and vocabulary. In my recommendation I would like to encourage you to complete all the tasks you can do, there are many exercises about many cases.

In my view, requiring volunteers as mandatory work that student have to complete to graduate is a great idea and must be carried out in high schools. I will give three reasons to prove my opinion. First, volunteer work suits with student. Almost student have a lot of free time, and volunteering can make this free time into a meaningful time so they can dedicate their time and work for the community. The next reason, student can gain plenty of soft skills during doing as a volunteer. Because volunteer work requires the volunteer to work with people to make something for other people, student can prove some skills in teamwork, communication, time-management, planning, event organizing, and so on. And the last one, doing volunteer help students aware of life more clearly. During volunteer work, meeting miserable people make them feel sympathetic with the unlucky, so they will regard to what they have and want to give more for the social. In conclusion, it is good for students if their high school turn volunteering into compulsory work for graduation because it benefits to both community and student.

The number of people who always use computers and tablets is increasing day by day. Because of that technological tools always in our lives. We can manage our works with these tools easily. While many people prefer to use computers and tablets, other people choose to use books in their school life. In my opinion, using techonological tools sometimes can be efficient but we should use books instead of computers and tablets. Computers and tablets can be a distraction in our school lives. So many people using these tools to take notes and study. I believe that this can be affect our distraction. Our focus time is decreasing.

Author admired four seasons, and said “Shiki” in Japanese. In my mother town, there are many kinds of festival association with “Shiki”. I have been affected by them. My emotion was grown by loving “Shiki”. By the way, what's your favorite season? My favorite is Autumn. Do you know why? I love the whisper of “Suzumushi”. And the full moon in Autumn is the most beautiful one in the year. If you have never seen that, you should get an airplane ticket to Japan. It will be an experience that you can never forget. I am sure of it. Please tell me your memory about seasons. I am looking forward to happening to meet your letter!

I can only sleep in a dark and quiet place because I am a very light sleeper. I am easily awoken by a thin shred of light or a small voice. I may awake once or twice in the early morning by my parents' voices. If the curtains are not closed, the morning sunlight usually awakes me. Moreover, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room because I believe that it is better for my health, and that is supported by science. Sleeping in the dark and quiet is really helpful to my brain and body.

Someone, he said, required urgent dental surgery. My folks concurred, but if I had the alternative, I wouldn't do that.

Music is something exclusive recreational but totally necessary for our lives. I couldn't live without music because I really love music. I love going to a concert, I love discover a new good artist a read about him and his career. Unfortunately I couldn't play the guitar because I am not talented but it don't care, I love music in the same way. I like to follow local artists and I think that in my country we have excellent music but it is not appreciated by local people. I love music because it can make us feeling better or badder about our feelings. Life without music would be sadder, all people would be sad every moment without the possibility to get better because we wouldn't have music. But also I think this would be impossible because music is the same to be human. It is like a natural ability of humanity.

Due to advancement of electronic books, the question of if computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities is discussed widely. Fortunately, renowned experts have a precise answer for this query. In their view, this suggestion shouldn't carried out due to the fact that e-books are quite vulnerable to power outages and corruption. To illustrate, all digital textbooks could be hacked in a matter of seconds, disabling education hazardously for a couple of weeks. Therefore, this kind of data should be always backed up, no matter how bulky the backups are. However, it doesn't mean that we must discard traditional books entirely. After all, they have numerous advantages: First and foremost, they don't use up much space. Furthermore, they efficiently fight deforestation. And last but not least, they are easier to carry around. In conclusion, I would argue that computers and tablets should be combined with traditional books instead of replacing them completely in schools and universities.

The more the gap between the rich and the poor grows, the more alluring wealth becomes. This state of affairs reminds us of the old saying: It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. With the aim of solving this dilemma, the relationship between health and money will be covered in the essay. Obviously, money can't cure all of the diseases. To illustrate, in spite of being heavily funded, oncologysts haven't found an effective treatment for cancer yet. Furthermore, there is a plethora of fatal rare diseases waiting to be cured. And as expected, they don't care about the patients' bank accounts. On the other hand, it can't be denied that money possesses a profound effect on our health. That is to say, maintaning health requires costly needs such as a clean and secure shelter, hygen and healthcare infrafracture, balanced diet etc. Besides, some research suggest that wealthier patients usually receive more efficient treatments. In conclusion, I would argue that wealth is superior to health due to the fact that it maintains health, though it isn't always the case.

That means we have a hot weather most of the time. That pleases me a lot! It is almost impossible to like this winter. Therefore, my favourite season of the year is the summer. Especially at the beginning, it is warm but not so much. I like this part. During this part of summer, it is perfect to go out any time of the day. You can really enjoy your life whatever the time. It is up to you. I also like the fact we can dress less clothes, which makes our bodies are freer. At the peak of summer, it is really hot and not so enjoyable. We sweat much more in that hot weather. We have to be careful to not get stinky. Also, you need to stay in the shadows, in order to not get burned.

Dear town council, I am currently writing to you concerning your thoughts about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in other facilities. As far as I am concerned, removing the right to use phones during a trip or from a direction to another is a bit tough. As a matter of fact, everyone feel the need to go checking their notifications on social media, looking at the daily news on the Internet or even sending messages to a relative. Phones are now common in our society, banning the use of them would be seen as constraints. However, you could reconsider other possibilities to, at least, decrease the issue of always using phones on public places. On the one hand, I truly agree with you with the idea of reducing the use of phones but not completely. For example, I advise you to set up an accurate schedule in order to show animation in shops or restaurants to catch people' eyes: and they may not be on their phones again. On the other hand, you cannot oblige people not to use their phones. So, let them use it when they need them. To sum up, reducing the use of phones, and not banning them is the best option, according to me. It would finally let people free from their phone's screens and make them realise in what a wonderful and gorgeous society they are living in. I would be delighted if you take my opinion into consideration. If you need a further thought on your request, send me a letter. All the best

I agree whit this sentence that health is more important than being rich . In my opinion when we are health we can try to arriving wealth . But opposite if we don't be health we probably can't gain wealth . We sometimes might spend our health for money or money for health . When we are health we can work and try better. I think health is a kind of wealth and we must be grateful for having it in every moment . In the moments you have a pain and an injury , nothing makes happy you and you are ready to give all of your wealth to achieve your health . so health also effects on our spirit .

Learning English English is the most popular language on Earth. And people can't live without English unless they have a translator or don't learn other things. Many people learn English just because English is used all over the world, and it will seem that they're good at studying. But they don't have too many things to do with English. I learn English just because I want to go to one of America's best universities to learn. Just like Harford or Oxford. I have to speak English very well if I want to go there to learn. United Kindom also speaks English, only that their pronunciation is slightly British. But it's the same language, English! Another reason I am learning English is that I love traveling to all places, a large number of people can speak English, and if I learn English, I can communicate with them. These are the reasons that I am learning English. Thanks for reading!

Sleeping is important in our lives, so we need to sleep very well for at least six hours per day. Some people are comfortable in a dark and quiet room and some people prefer pale light and noise is not a problem for them. In my opinion, it is not important because each person has their prefer sleeping type. The most important point is we should sleep enough per day. I can't sleep very well in bright spaces and but pale light or dark spaces are not affected by me. I don't like noises because if someone is make a noise I can't sleep very well . So if I need to choose between them, I will choose a small light and a quiet space, because I can't sleep in the day light.

I'm working with data wrangling and programming, so the Python conference will be very important to me because I will be able to share my knowledge with people from different places outside of my city. I worked with Python programming for about one year and I love this language programming, and I believe that I have so much yet to learn. My co-workers also will participate in the event and we hope to get ideas to improve our projects. Case your party is postponed, I can come to your party on the date you set after this Saturday. I will define your party as a priority in my schedule. If your party actually happens this Saturday, I wish you a lively and fun party. You deserve the best. I love you, my friend.

I thinkg that it depends in the quality of the teacher and the topic that we are learning. For example is the teacher is good then maybe it will be better if we have only one for many years but if he is a bad teacher it will be badder if we change this teacher quickly. Other important thing is the topic. I think that English is beneficied if we studying that with many teacher because with that we can learn differences vacabularies and accents. We have to listen and understand many accent and with that we will learn the ability to understand anyone. But to answer the questions about having different teachers I prefer to have different teachers. We can take the best of each one and with that learning so much. Another fact to have account is that with several teacher we also develop our social skills and this always is a great plus.

Everybody has relaxing activities in their spare time. Some people prefer indoor activities while others prefer outdoot activities. I'm a private person so my favourite activity is indoor cooking with my wife. My world is tiny and my wife is everything to me. Cooking has been my favourite activity since I was 15 years old.

My opinion is based in my own experience and I have to say that I love the video games. I keep playing video games newadays and I enjoy and learn so much with the video games. You can learn about several topics like history, empathy, logic thought, and so on. Then I think that video games can do good things to our children improving their intelligence and also their knowledge about the whole world. An important topic that is improved with video games is the English. It is comprobed that in countries where English is not the main language this hobby helps children to have a good vocabulary in the future because the most of games are not doubled to other languages then the kids have to play the game in English and with that they are learning new words while they are having fun and passing the time. This is an amazing hobby.

I think that if the zoo have quality then it is better to the animals because people in the zoo always take care of animals with great devices and gadgets. Even I think that some animals are alive because of that for example pandas. Pandas are animals that are in danger but one for the reasons for that is that they can't process their own food by themselves. They have to wait to a person that process the food for them. And I am sure that must exist more animals in the same situation, namely, animals who are depending on the people to live correctly. We don't have to go to the extreme situation with the animals, even the animals who don't need humans to survive they receive a great treat and they are so happy in the facilities in the zoo. Of course that I am talking about great zoos with great invesment.

I went to Madrid, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris and we spent close to 2 days per city. All cities were spectacular and each one had their own amazing things. My favorite city was Barcelona because it has a lot of thing that I like. The city has a football culture because it has one of the biggest teams in the world and they really love their team. Also it has a great sea with a beautiful beach. In the second place I enjoyed Amsterdam because it was the most different city compared with my city Bogotá. Their architecture was so interesting, and the rivers across the city are so beautiful. Also it has the coffee shops where you can smoke weed without a problem because it is legal in Nederlands.

I think that all of that are advantages. Maybe it has only one disadvantages that it could be a little expensive but the advantages are very much huge. If you have the possibility to study abroad then I recommend you to take this option because travelling abroad is one of the most enriching activities that you can do. You will live amazing experiences with many people. You will understand other cultures and you will grow as human being. Also if you don't have English as your native language you could learn a lot of English by travelling. I am sure that in a year we can learn a lot of English living in a city where everyone speak in English. And as the last thing but not less importance stuying abroad will give you a lot of experience that you will remember years after as you will realize that you have had a good life.

I think that every count when we are talking about our health. I mean, it exists a lot of factors that could intervine in our health. First is exercise or physical activity. I think that is not necessary to do exercise all days and more than one hour or something like that. We can just do a little of physical activity and with other factor we could live healthily. Other importance factor is the food. We must eat healthy the most of the time, obbiously we can eat junk food but not every day. Another thing that I think is so importance is the mind. You have to mantein your mind healthy. It depends how you can mantein your mind healthy because the activities change between each one of us. If meditation works for you then do it, or maybe you like tolearn new things then do it or something that works for everyone is travelling.

Dear Alex, I hope you're well. Your routine may have been busy due to the upcoming party on Saturday. I assume you are overwhelmed by the preparations and arrangements . Rather than calling you and bothering you, I've decided to write to you. I also know how important this party is to you. It's one of the biggest events you've ever organized in your career. You are an exceptional professional in this area, and I have no doubt that you will nail it! The main director of my company has decided to change the whole sector. It is what he calls "reshape." For this reason, he've demanded additional tasks and adjustments to our protocols. As you can imagine, I'm completely stressed out. In face of these unforeseen circumstances, unfortunately, I will not be able to attend your party. I am deeply sorry for missing out! You know I've been waiting for this event for over 2 months, and I had already planned my outfit. I hope I'll have the opportunity to participate in your future parties and see in reality the greatness of your work. Best wishes Barbara

Travelling is a curious topic because I think that we as a society are getting stuck with it. In others topic like internet, computers, mobiles, vehicles, medicine, and so on, humanity are developing new advances every day but travelling remains with the same fastest way to travel what is the airplane. What I am trying to say is that we can't improve the speed what we can travel to other part of the world. For the last 3 decades we can't go faster and we spend the same hours to go between America and Europe for example. All advances are with the small distances. Land vehicles are advancing everyday, they are changing and maybe in the future all of that will have electric supply. To sum up, I think that in the furute to travel long distance we will manage the same periods of time but to travel short distances we will improve that more and more each day.

How will be the school of the future? This is a question really hard to get a correct answer because school are changing every day and more with the last pademic when school had to implement online courses or something different because student and people couldn't go out. Then now schools have new way to teach and more resources. Maybe in the furute schools could be hybrid, a presential half and online half. Or also it could be only presential lessons and online lessons as a plus to the students who want to keep learning and studying. But to answer I think that schools will remain practically the same. We have a way to teach, we as society have used it for many years and now this is very difficult to change. The easiest way to teach is keep teaching in the same way.

I think that any devices are bad or useless the problem is how we use them. Television could be educative but it depends in the way we use it. It exists many educational show like documentaries. Also television could be a great tool to learn some language. For example I use it to learn English. I watch a chapter per day totally in English to practise my listening and vocabulary and also I enjoy the chapter that I am watching. It is the most important example that I can give you to show how television can be an educational device. It's like video games. It also could be an educational way to learn something. Or even music. All depend on how you use the thing and what do you want to learn with that device or activity. I enjoy a lot my routine of practising English with a tv show.

May to reach happiness we must earn money and buy things, or maybe it could be reached practicing sports or reading many books. The method to reach happiness could be so different to each one of us but something is traversal without taking account who we are. We have to be healthy. If we don't have health then we can't reach or do anything of the activities that a name before or any other activity.

It's communly saying that you are learning English because you want to travel around the world or because you want to get a better job but for me the main reason to learn English it's because I want to be able of read, listen or watch a lot ofinformation in their original language. English is the language of the world then if you want to learn about one topic or read an interesting book you maybe have to read it in English. A lot interesting books or funny series are in English or get more quality if you see that in English.

All sales department staff had an dicussion about what style of the new room will be replaced in yesterday. Two styles of business room are traditional rooms with enclosed workstations or cubicles and modern rooms with open design, which will be decided by staff. In my opinion, I think modern rooms with open design are better than others. First, the most of company rent offices to working in the present. The open design saves workspace by eliminating thick walls between rooms. Rooms are sperated by glass walls, mezzanine partition or panels. We do not much money for renting. Besides, the open design mean that one room for all staff, we do not need to buy a lot of equipment for each staff, all equipment are shared by all staff. Secondly, the open design creates a dynamic working environment. Employees can see each other so they can easily communication together, which make them feel like a team. Finally, the open design enhances work efficiency. Managers can easily check what staff are working on. In addition, employees will limit personal work during working time. So staff will work more effectively.

Learning to speak a foreign language is more important these days than it was in the past. This is because nowadays we can communicate with any person around the world with our cellphones or computer. Then we can work, play, write and more with other people and to do that we need to speak with them. In the past we didn't have this possibility then we just had to speak our native language. And of all foreign languages the most important is English. You must know English nowadays if you want to have a great job or travel around the world in any country because with English you will be able to talk with any person. If other country don't have English as their native language then some people will learn English and you will be able to communicate with them.

I don't believe that computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities. Books are a beautiful way to touch knowledge. With a book you can feel the knowledge as an object isntead in a computer when you only see letters in a screen. With a book you are owner of a part of knowledge. Another thing is that with a book you will take care of your eyes instead in a computer or tables the screen will hurt your eyes with the time. Also I like more reading in book that in a screen. I read in screens because I don't have some book or because I don't find the information in a book but in general I prefer reading in a book, real papers. I don't have any more to say about the topic. I prefer books but I know that computer are more needed that books.

I have a dicussion with my parents about students should live with family while they are studying at university or they should move away and live alone yesterday. In my opinions, I think students should live with their family until they graduate from university. Firstly, students who are studying at university, aged from 18 to 22, are still young and do not have enough life experience, do not understand well about social life, they are easily gullible to strangers. A lot of people are tricked about money by scammers or their friends when they were students in the present. Secondly, students live with their family when they study at university which is a way to decrease burden about money for their family. Students must pay a lot of money for four years studying at university. Besides, if students want to move away and live alone, they must pay money for cost of living every month. However, most students depend on family financies , so most of the money is paid by their family. It is a great burden of each family. They do not have knowledge about value of money in life and how hard to have it. Finally, if students want to have independence about financial when they move away and live alone, they must find a part-time job to have money, they must spend most of their time for it, so they have not enough time for studying and voluteer work. Part-time work will affect their academic performance at university.

What can you say to meet another day such as next Saturday? I have a perfect idea! If you will available, we can hang out at the Yedigöller camping area which was chosen as the best place among all camping areas last year. People who went there had a good time last year and enjoyed their camps. That is why I consider that it might be nice to assess our weekend. Although I have a car to go there, we should rent an off-road car. I have some camping stuff like a tent, a thermos, and a camping bag. However, we have to buy some materials that are not. I will write to make a plan about camping in more detail soon. Do not forget to send photos from the party. I would like to hope you enjoy the party, have a nice day and take care.

To the council office, I have recently heard that you have any idea to ban the mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. I hope that this news may be wrong, and you, whom I have recognized as the wiser council that we have had ever, do not have any crazy view about banning mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. For me, you are the best policy maker that never want to involve yourself in batty things, and you are a man who always want to make a wonderful change to society, and build a delighted community. If that is a right news, I suggest that, please, do not take this plan because the mobile phone is a handy and hefty today instrument. We do not even imagine any person without this handy tool. I admit that this useful tool makes many problems through society for example it makes noisy environment, and may be the cause of many traffic accidents. For solation, we must not prevent the use of phone on public place, but we must limit the use of this fragile tool for many individuals for example bus and taxi drivers and waiters. It seems very crazy why you want to ban the use of mobile phone in shops. I do not know exactly what the reason is, and for what purpose people do not have permission to use their mobile phones in shops. If there exists a hidden reason, please, reveal it as soon as possible. In my opinion, that decision must be cancelled.

Music is probably one of the best things that people once begun interested in. I think that almost everybody around the globe really enjoys time listening to music. Listening to music started being a common thing throughout people's lives. Whatever people are doing, if there is a chance to listen to music while doing it, they usually do it. People are listening to music while they are cooking or working out or just commuting to their destinations. The fantastic thing about music is that it somehow can change people's mood. Depending on what kind of music a person is listening to, it can make them fell happy, excited, energetic and also sad. So even though people might be in a bad mood one day, music can change it completely. There are certainly times when music is very important. And that times is when people are depressed and needed to be made happier. And in some ways music could do it. Another thing about music is that in lyrics of music, there could be a lot of hidden sense that you could realize while listening to it and that could affect on you as well. I think that our lives would be entirely different without music. It would probably be a lot more boring and not exciting to do things without music. People who make music would not be able to freely express themselves as they could do it in music, and so they would likely be more closed to others. Also, they would not be able to make money from music. If there would not be music at all, the bad thing about it is that every moment of the live that contained music in it would not be remembered as good as it might. Just listening to music could remind you a lot of things from the past, either it would be happy moments or sad moments. I personally extremely enjoy these feeling when you get to listen to music that was playing at that concrete time in your life. It is incredible. From my perspective, the world without music would be definitely not as good as it is now..

But when I was in the school my favorite season was obbiously the chrismats because I received gifts and I got out to the vacations at the same time. But nowadays I work all the year and I have to request my holidays then I can't choose a season for the holidays. The other reason doesn't matter either because as I am an adult now then I don't receive gift anymore. Maybe one or two but not the number that I received in the past. Then I don't have a good reason to choose a season with my current style of life. Maybe could keep being the christmasts because I enjoy this season.

Dear Sir/Madam, I read your announcement about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shop and restaurants at the government website yesterday. I have some opinions want to share to you. First, the mobile phone is a great envention of mankind, we use it to contact with other people around the world, search the information on the internet, play games, have a character like a camera which help taking and storage nice memories by pictures. The mobile phone is very popular, most people around the world have one of it in the present. You want to ban it that mean you refuse the development of mankind from the past to the present. Second, mobile phones become a part of people's life in now, people use it to read the newspaper online when they come back home by public transport, they use it to take some photos with friends or just themselves when they come a new store or new restaurant. People couldn't use mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants mean that they put a part of their life at home when they come here. I think they couldn't do that instead them will leave there. It will make a big damage for the economy of our city. Thirdly, people use mobile phones to contact each other like friends, member of their family, employees. If they couldn't use it in public, it will become a big problem for daily life. For example, when you are on your way home, your wife wants you to buy meat and vegetables at a convenient store, usually she will call you by mobile phone. However, the government promulgate a law about banning the use of the mobile phone in public, she only talk to you when you stay at home. So you waste a lot of time for buying food. I think banning mobile phones is impossible at the present.

Everybody lies and that's okay When we are children, our parents always say that lying is wrong, however one common strategy to convince the kid that this is something wrong, is saying phrases like: "if you lie your nose will grow up" and it is obviously not true. Based on a cartoon of Pinochio, a story about a doll made of wood by a carpenter, this doll has life and they usually lie a lot, and always he does that his nose grow more and more. The adults always tell lies, for example: "Santa exists" and in reality it is just Santa's fantasy, worn by the daddy or other family to give gifts on Christmas. We need to explain for the children that if they lie a lot the people won't believe more, besides, some lies could be several consequences and show some of examples and risks, but it's important not to create an image of lie as the worst thing in the world, sometimes there are not a problem in say some white lies, for create magic, in examples of cartoons and fairy tale stories in general, for not hurt someone or teach that sometimes you cannot answer with your point of view, and gives a pattern answer as "beauty is relative"

I had a dicussion with my parents about people must always tell the truth or people is sometimes acceptable to tell a lie. In my opinions, I think people is sometimes acceptable to tell a lie. When you tell the true to some one, they can be shameful or harmful so we use the white lie in situations. White lie is a term which is used to tell some things not true but useless and harmless to anyone. In the medical area, when patients have incurable disease, doctor, who take care of patients, often don't tell the truth about medical condition for them. In contrast, doctor will say their medical condition is very good and they are recovering to normal, they just say the truth for patients' family. If doctor tell the truth about medical condition for patients, they could feel nervous, anxiety about it. It has bad effective for treatment or make sicknes is more worst. In addition, the truth is sometimes unacceptable for some one, people usually want to hear something good about themselves instead of bad. For example, when your staff, who work together with you in a company, asked you about how do you feel about her new dress which is worn on her body today. In your mind, you feel it so urgly, terrible and unsuit for her. However, if you tell the truth about your emotion about her dress to her, she could feel uncomfortable, shameful, or angry. It can make a broken in bond between you and her in working and communication. Instead of you will say it is so beautiful and suitable for her. In the present, if you say the truth, you would have enemy. If you say the lie, you have friends.

In recent times, the rumor has been spreading all over the world of replacing books with electronic devices, such as tablets and computers. Many agree, but others do not and the two "factions" express their opinion through pros and cons. One of the pros is that it would reduce the risk of deforestation without cutting down the trees that are used to make paper. Another pro is that it would greatly reduce the weight of the backpack which is a problem for students who are far from school. One of the cons, however, is that, in my opinion, those who cannot afford a tablet or computer will not be able to attend school lessons. Another cons is that, in my opinion, electronic devices will never be able to replace paper books because even from the standpoint of touch it would change badly. In the end, if the books are really replaced by tablets and computers, we will make a decision.

Hi, Billal I'm happy to tell you about my trip I did last week with my class. We went to Maritime Museum of Quebec. It was really interesting. There was 2 boats to visit. The visit of boats was absolutely extraordinary. The guide's explanations throughout the tour of all floors from the engine room to the upper deck, were clear. On the deck of the boat, the view was beautiful. The St-Lawrence River extended as far as the eye could see. For me, this trip has been very instructive. I learnt a lot about the boats. I learnt a lot about the work of sailors. See you soon.

There are four seasons in a year. These are spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasons are just the opposite in Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. For instance, if you are in Northern Hemisphere, summers are hot, but the other Hemisphere is cold. The seasons affect the psychology of people. People feel sad and depressed in winter and fall. They drink their coffee under their blankets by looking out the window. During spring and summer, people become more active and full of life than in other seasons. I like being active therefore my favorite season is spring. There are two reasons why I like it. The first reason is that the weather is neither cold nor hot. The mild weather does not make you sweat or shiver. The second reason is that nature renews itself in spring. For example, animals migrate from cold countries to warm areas, and trees and flowers bloom. All this change makes people energetic. Therefore I like spring.

I have a discussion with my parents about does all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week in the present. In my opnions, I agree with that ideal. Firstly, the stroke is tending to be younger, the main cause of stroke is an inactive lifestyle. A new study in the journal Sport shows that anyone, who doesn't get enough or less than 150 minutes of exercise a week, has a rate getting stroke higher than normal, so people should get at least 150 minutes of exercise every week. In the present, the amount of young adult, who are students, have an inactive lifestyle increase more than in the past. Almost time of them are just for using the smart phone, internet and social online. The rate of stroke at young adult increases every year. Secondly, taking exercise make people have a nice body, good strength and good mental. Scientists, whose main research is on sport, have show that people, who take exercise daily, live longer and are healthier than people don't do it. If you want to long life and healthful, you must take exercise every day. In addition, exercise also helps people relax after a hard working day, increasing concentration and intelligence. Finally, students, who take exercise at school, have many opportunities to practise soft skills such as teamwork, communication, planning. The taking exercise at school has a lot of participants so students can talk and have fun together, they have opportunities to practise communication and teamwork. In addition, some sports have win-lose nature, forcing participants to have a plan to determine victory or defeat, so students have opportunities to practise planning skill. The ideal that students must have physically active at least 3 times a week is a good decision.

Hi, I hope you're doing well ! I wanted to let you know about a movie I've watched recently with friends. I really had fun watching it, that's why I think you should watch it too. It is named "Johny English" and relates the story of a rather naive British spy. He wants to be as good as the best agents of the MI6, but he achieves only the greatest mistakes. The story in itself is quite simple: a French guy tries to become King of England in a view to transform it in a huge prison. But Johny English and his partner will try to stop him, which leads to a chaining of hilarious mistakes. I hope you'll have fun watching it ! Have a nice week end. John

Nowadays, most of the people seem to be obsessed with their mobile phones, and it is crucially awful. And that will be outstanding to make people less immersed into their social lives. And I appreciate any town council's attempts to prompt it, but the idea of banning the use of mobile phone on public transport and in shops and restaurants altogether seems to me too bad decision. And that type of measures needs to be rethought and replaced by less strong and more pleasure. And for that, there are a couple of reasons. The first one is that some people do need to use mobile phones due to the important messages or calls, and they just couldn't wait until a receiver would go out and answer to it. The second reason why people might need to use a mobile phone in those cases is that they might need to look something up on the internet or write a note. However, in multitude ways, people just use their phones to entertain themselves during the boring parts when they are at that places. And I think that the best that the council may do is that they will redesign the council's banning. The council should place a rule at that places that will declare that people must just turn off the volume of the phones and use it in a way that don't interrupt others. And in addition to the rule, the council should create an environment at these places that will get visitors immersed and make them forget about phones. That will be a gorgeous action from the council's side for most of the people.

The reason for the problem that rural areas don't have enough doctor to their people is that a doctor can earn more money working in big cities. If you would be a doctor and you would have the possibility to work in a city or in a rural area and you will earn more money in the city then what election you would choose. I can be sure that the most of the times people will choose work in the city without thinking about the benefits that people can get if they work in a rural area. First of all if you work in a rural area then you will have a more relaxing life that if you work in the city. Also it is true that you will earn more money in the city but also you will spend more money in the city then at the finish you will earn close the same money in both places.

Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? I think it is not possible. Books were the most important source of information for centuries. In our day still like this. But the Internet replaces books on some issues. Books are still important sources of information but the internet is more accessible and easier to use. If you want to access some information you don't have to go to the library, just sit and write to google whatever you want. So computers and tablets can be useful. But I think they do not replace to book. İ t can't be. Yes, the Internet is very useful but also has a lot of wrong information. Sometimes you can't distinguish between wrong or right information. Also, reading book is a culture. The opinion computers are tablets replaced by books scares me. Everything transforms into a technological thing. Sometimes the old is just something to need.

Its true that exists two different types of office that companies manage. One type is an office with cubicles where people only see their screens and no more and the other type is an office that don't have any cubicle and all people can see the others because there don't have so many walls. I think and I can be closely sure that the best option is an open office because with that people are happier and if people are happier then they will work efficiently. I can't believe that many companies nowadays keep managing their employees with close offices. That kind of offices are really awful and maybe it was very popular in the past but now are other times. Now people need open offices to work comfortable. If you casually are a boss with employees in one of this close office please change that inmediatelly and improve your company with an open office.

Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my country and specifically in my school this practice is implemented. I had to do a volunteer with the buses of my school helping the most little children to carry their backpacks and open the doors to the buses. I think that it is a good practice because with that many people can get some help that maybe it volunteer work in the schools doesn't exists then these people wouldn't have this appreciated help. I know that this volunteer work could be helping children with their homework or simply helping to study some hard topic like maths or a language. I consider volunteer work like a good practice because with that we use the time of our teenagers and we teach them that helping is a good thing and maybe we must help people frequenly.

I think that studying music in the school is an enormeus plus to school that implement these classes. If I would have a child I would prefer that his school will have music classes. I think that it is a good thing because it could be a great practice to entertainment the children with a good and healthy thing. And in the future they will thank us to have taught to play an instrument. Playing an instrument could be a really difficult activity but if they start to study that since they are children then they will learn to play a guitat for example easier that an adult. It something similar to learn English or another language. If you learn this when you are a child it is better that learning it when you already are an adult. Other important thing is that I think that music is happiness and with that we are giving happiness to our children.

Books have been important since the invention of paper. Knowledge, feelings, and ideas were transferred with books for ages. With computers and tablets becoming popular, recently the use of books has been decreasing. Computers have taken the place of books in many fields. In my opinion, computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities due to ease of use, easier portability, and environmental reasons. First of all, tablets provide easy access to information. We can find any information we want with one click of a button. Students buy their textbooks on the internet, and they can read them on tablets. Most of my classmates use tablets instead of books. Another reason is that tablets are more portable than books. We can fit billions of books in a computer. A tablet weighs approximately 500 grams while an average book weighs about one kilogram. Considering that a student carries more than three books a day makes a huge difference. Lastly, millions of trees are being cut down to make books every year. On the other hand, tablets and computers never use trees. So they don't cause any damage to forests.

Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family while they are students. I think that the better choice is go to another place and living the complete experience of being a university student but if you don't have the opportunity to do that you don't have to regret that because you can have a great experience also living with your parents. And this choice have other benefits. If you live with your parents while you are studying at university then you will be able to focus on the exams and projects of the university because you won't have to think about house things like cleaning or cooking. You only will have to think about exams and no more. And if you choose living at another place you will have total independence and this is one of the greatest thing in the world.

Hi Alex, Thank you for inviting me to the party this Saturday afternoon. But I am so sorry to you that I can't join. I booked an appointment with my dentist. I've had a toothache for a few weeks now.

This letter is headed addressed to the town council and it is regarding about the new idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transportation and in shops and restaurants. I really think that it is a really bad idea. I couldn't find a reasonable reason to think that this new idea could be a great idea. We can't simply don't use our phones. People spend a lot of time in public transportation or waiting something in a shop, even we have to wait our food in a restaurant and we use our mobile phones to make time better. We use our phones that times when you don't have anything to do because you have to wait for something. I think that it isn't a bad practice and we need to use our phones. Also another reason to not realize the idea is that maybe people could need their phones because an emergency. We don't know when we could need our phone because our mom or any relatives had an accident or maybe if a relative need some money right now then we could need the phone to communicate to them. It exists a lot of situations when people could need their celphones and the town council can't forbit the use of mobile cellphones. I think that it will be like a dictatorship or something similar.

I think that the world could be a great place if all os us would be a good person but it is impossible because exists bad people. It occurs something similar about the lies. Maybe the world would be a better place if people don't say lies or few lies. I think that in some cases we can say some lies but this is only aceptable when the lies don't do any bad thing to the other person. I think that big lies are unaceptable. Big lies like infidelity, robbery or something that could make something bad to other person. I am sure that if people would be more worried about the situation of other people we can have a better place to live because we could be sure that anyone wants to make something bad to us. We could go outside without the fear of being stolen or something badder like a rape. We all know that people around the world could be very evil and we always have to prevent that and keep save ourselves. It would be wonderful if we could walk without worries. This is the world that I dream. I know that many times people do these things because they are in bad economic situations but I think that it is not an excuse to do bad things to others. All of us have our own problems.

In my opinion, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room than sleeping with a small light on with some noise. I prefer that over the ladder option because of two main reasons: The first reasoning is that I had gone to school for over five years. That matters a lot because my teacher does not allow us to make noise and she turns off all the lights and closes the curtains while we sleep. Also, the majority of time in the day is spent at school so our eyes will be more used to darkness. The second reasoning of that is when you sleep at night, virtually nothing makes noise then. Your body will soon adapt to those circumstances and then at some point, you would have to sleep in a dark and quiet room to sleep quickly. Mainly for the two above reasons, I prefer to sleep in a dark and quiet room than sleeping with a small light on with some noise.

Hello everyone, I was asked to write an article about the question what my favourite season of the year is. It is easy to say it is the autumn but it would not be an article when I only answer the question in one sentence. So I would describe in the following text why I like the autumn so much. One reason for it would be the colorful trees. It is really special in no other season you have this and I like it so much, when the leafs turn from green to yellow or red. And the best of it is when you have a blowing of the wind and the colorful leafs fallig like rain to the ground. It is difficult to describe how beautiful it is. Another reason why I like the autumn so much is the weather. I would say it is the perfect mix between cold and warm. You have a warm rainfall sometimes or you have low temptures but a sun where warms you up. It is really perfect.

Some scientists argue that computers and tablets are beneficial to the students at school and at the universities . Such devices combine are great tools to learn hard topics. However, I strongly disagree with these scientists and believe that tablets and computers can not replace books at school or university. My believe is that electornic devices are not helpful to learn hard topics since their main objective is to advertise people. For ewample, I owned a tablet when I was younger and I had never used it to learn anything related to any lectures I had. Before the invention of tablets and computers, students did not have any computers or tablets and they were as clever as we are. They did not have any access to wikipedia or any websites to ease their learning. It's important to teach students how to find the information by themselves. With tablets and computers, it easy for them to do some research on the internet and get an answer under a microseconde. To sum up, I do not believe that such electronic devics are helpful and have a positive impact on student way of learning. I even think the opposite.

People nowadays tend to be less active and consume more unhealthy food than they used to back in the days. And as many researchers show that the fewer a person have activity during the day the worse their health become. And there is a huge problem with young population who are spending hours and hours a day siting at home and playing video games which have a negative impact on their health. It is crucial to be active during the day and spend more time outside rather than inside. Because human's organism didn't use to spend that much time inactive. It used to have lots of activity and work during the day. And now we need to find the ways to get people realized and encouraged to work out at least three times per week and spend more time being active. But it is bad idea to force that people into doing sports activities because it may cause a big problem: they will be discouraged and obligated to do it. And eventually, that may end up in them being fed up with, and they will give it up. It is essential to show them that it may be not only good for their mental and cognitive health but also fascinating and worth-spending time. The best way to do it is to build up more developed sports sphere that will provide people with lots of opportunities to be active and spend time beneficially. For instance, the government may open up more gyms in the cities and provide them with brand-new appliances and good staff with lots of knowledge to train and encourage people to work out. It is extremely essential to not force anybody to do sports activities. They need to get encouraged and get willingness to do it themselves. Otherwise, it may end up with bad results.

Otherwise, my parents allowed me to have a party at home the week after we return to the country. If you'd like, we could do it and we could invite all our school friends. Tell me what you feel about me and let me know as soon as possible so we can start planning everything. Your friend, Iva.

When our parents went to school they could only use the book as a tool to study and follow lessons. However, in our current society, all it's changed thanks to technology. Indeed, computers and tablets get more accessible to everyone and as a consequence, a large percentage of students should have one or both of them in their respective houses. There is useful since you can browse the Internet with words or processes you don't catch it. I did it, especially when I had to understand the main steps of a biochemical process. On the other hand, it's considered by many parents that these devices could have been a distraction during the study. It occurred because these devices permit us to do other activities such as watching videos and listening to music. In each thing, they are pros and cons but we make the most to do it correctly. From my perspective, computers and tablets won't be replacing books in school and university in the following years. The explanation is they should raise our inattention inevitably, getting worse marks compared to with books.

In people's life, what they do and what they achieve defines their whole life. People always talk about what has recently happened to them or what they have done when there is a get together. Joyful and fulfilled occasions always stay with people. As for starters, personally I believe shorter but more intense life is better than a very long and calm life. Of course I want to live long but if my only choice for a long life is living "calm" and doing nothing it is a dealbreaker. Furthermore, I want to do lots of things such as travelling, getting out most nights instead of sitting at home doing nothing, trying out new things. I want to make most out of my life, I want to make significant memories. As long as I am happy with my life and think that I have achieved what I have wanted to it does not matter at what age I will die. To move on, for me calm life means stable but a dull time-spending as well as intense life means busy but a joyful journey. For example just like most people I want to have some kind of stable life like having a big comfortable house but I do not want to spend my whole life in that house. I want to travel, work hard, try out new things. I want to have a good, intense life. In conclusion, how much you've lived does not define the quality of your life. However, how much you've achieved does. Live fast, die young.

The program that is Write and Improve is very helpful because of these main reasons: It is very helpful because of these main reasons: The first reasoning is that it gives learners at any skill level the ability to greatly improve their English writing skills with some practice. After writing, you can test your writing level with official tests to see if you are at the skill level you think. Also, you can change your writing and it does not permanently stay there after you write once. There are at the bare minimum one hundred lessons for any skill level which is a lot of lessons to improve your writing. It also gives feedback for wrong words, forgotten words, wrong forms, tenses and whole sentences if there are any wrongly used words or misspelled words in that sentence. In the case of wrong words, it gives the correct word in a text box next to that wrong word that you can click on and see. You can even make your own tests in the program and give other people the ability to do your tests and share their results to you, as long as that person has already joined your workbook. There are classes you can make and join and view results of the students' lessons in your class. You can track your own writing, your activity and awards. You have a personal progress graph for the last ten checks in the program and a writing timer to keep track of your writing skills and the amount of time you need to do your writing. There is feedback, which is automatic, to say: "You have done great" or if you are wrong than it will say to look back at your writing time and skill level both in the past and present. You can also just write for fun in the program as well. There are all kinds of writings: essays, reviews, articles, reports and emails to study for the test in real life. In the program, you can see your writing and find your writings in a list without needing to search through every single one of your writings. Those writings have automatic grading that you and any outsiders can see. Also, you have a calendar of your amount of checks per day and your awards so your teacher can check what you are capable of doing and have done. You can't exploit the system by just repeating checks for a task lots of times. That is a very good aspect of that programme. The things that are worse about this program are: If you pass a certain word threshold that changes based on difficulty of your writing by pretty much any means, it will just add some points to your total score even if your phrasing is worse or your sentences end with a gap. The only difficulty that I have with this tool is the scores are not very accurate. I would highly suggest this program, Write and Improve to every English learner, whether you are a complete beginner or you have almost mastered English. There are a lot of great things in the program but sometimes things are a bit worse than expected. Overall, it is very good for learning writing.

Without following a proper diet, our body can't work properly, as the diet provide the nutrients, and energy necessary, for our body execute their daily activities. Also, most people don't realise how important our sleeping is. Usually, to be considered a good night's sleep, a person needs to sleep between 6 to 8 ours a night. Furthermore, not only quantitity, but the quality of our sleep is really important, so make sure to eat healthy, do exercises, and being emotionally stable is so important. The conclusion we need to have here is, isn't about the more important factor, but it is about doing the whole picture together like, spleep, exercises, and diet.

I think that I would prefer the shorter life if this intensity is for good things. Because this could be an intensity for the problem or bad situation. If this is the situation I prefer a calm life until 100 years old but if it is an intensity about good things like a wonderful travel or a gorgeous couple then I prefer the shorter life. This could be an easy answer for me because I don't plan or expect to life over 60 o 65 years. I think that I will live enough time to live a good life with my close people with many situation to remember. I could resume this thought saying that is better to have quality against having quantity. You have nothing if you life until 100 years old but without any important thing to remember or to tell. Until now I think that I have lived a good life with some bad things but the most of the time I have lived good things that give me amazing memories to tell to my children in the futuro. Now I found the love of my life and I hope to live many with her. And I think that a life of 65 years could be perfect to share with my love. I hope the life could give this and also many good moments with her.

To begin with, Travel, is one of my favourite hobbies, if not the most important one. Great part of my personality, was built because of my travelling. Everything started when I move to Australia for an exchange semester abroad. There, I could learn a new language, and explore a totally different word, and culture. Furthermore, in Australia, since it is a multicultural place, you can learn a lot about many other cultures. Also, with the advance of technology, travel is getting more accurate, and accessible to more people, since the ways of transportation are getting more efficient, and travelling is becoming cheaper, and quicker at the same time. At the same time, people working from home, or remotely, creates a whole new category of travellers, where countries who want to get benefits of this long term tourists, will have to create new places, and entertainment for those called digital nomads. And not only for those, researchers are showing that in the future, people will work fewer hours, due to the automation, and new tools it will be created. Consequentely, more time to consume goods, services, and of course do tourism. To me, this will be most significant change.

People sleep on a daily basis, but everyone has their own sleeping preferences regarding things like the amount of light and noise. Although some people do not mind light and noise while they sleep, I personally need a quiet and dark place to sleep. Otherwise, not only do I find it difficult to fall asleep, it is most likely to wake up frequently during the night. Indeed, I'd like to go to bed early and fall asleep immediately. Although I prefer to sleep with a little bit of light and in a quiet place, I have no problem with nature sounds like bird songs. Also, it would be great for me to have enough room to roll over while I'm sleeping.

On the one hand, zapping books at schools and colleges is an unreasonable scenario. It is a matter of fact that we are in the heyday of the information highway, but this does not mean the demise of the physical book. It is necessary to remember that not each school in the country is in the high echelons of richness. There are thousands and thousands of students unable to have proper facilities conducive to learning. The underdog lives on the edge of society. There are people unable to purchase either top-notch tablets, cutting-edge computers, or expensive technologies. What is more, many cannot even afford proper food or necessities. On the other hand, if society is able to provide the proper conditions to live to all people, it would be a conducive scenario to change physical books to digital ones. Nevertheless, it does not mean that all physical books will disappear, so only textbooks are due to make it. Lots of individuals are attached to having the real thing and enjoying deluxe and hardcover editions. Colleges would benefit from format changes because they would have access to updated information.

Telling the truth is obviously essential. When we were children,we have been taught not to tell lies, because it is wrong. Besides, we find hard to trust someone we caught telling a lie once. Therefore, it seems that always telling the truth is important. But I don't quite agree with this idea. In my opinion, telling the truth should always be preferred to tell a lie. However, there are a few situations, where telling a lie enables us to preserve a good relationship, or the sensibility of a person. For instance, telling someone who is asking you whether his son died in an accident or not that indeed, the son is dead is maybe not the best way to proceed. Rather than saying a brutal, violent truth which may shock or deseperate someone, a soft lie which leads to the truth could help this person to cope with this event when she'll learn about it . To lie should never be accepted, except in the occasions where it is in a view to conceal a hard, shocking truth, or when it leads in a softer way to the truth . To conclude, it is essential to always tell the truth, except in the few situations where it is better to make a small concealment of a shocking truth .

That's a fact, the school that we know today, is about to disappear. Most of the recent research have concluded that our current way of schooling, was created in the industrial era, where people need to be guided all the steps, with passive way of learning, which is basic absorbing content a source. The content, in this case, is defined by an educational curriculum, and is passed by a figure of a teacher or professor depending what environment you are based in. With the advance of technology, other skills, and abilities are demand from people to being able to perform, and pursue a working career. But how to prepare people from this new world? In my opinion, the School of the future, needs to focus on teach people to learn how to learn. Today, with the internet, we no longer need a figure of a teacher as we know, but instead a mentor, who will guide a student what to learn, and how to learn. We need to teach our kids to be self-learners, who independently will search for knowledge, adapting their own needs.

In my opinion, students should prefer to use computers and tablets,but these shouldn't completely books in school and universities because books are necessary for education. There are several students prefer to use technological equipment, such as faster, it includes a lot of informations and more useful. The first reason, students want to have information quickly.

The straight forward anwser for your question is yes, television can also educate people, especially if we're talking about children. Furthermore, television isn't considered the best tool to educate, because it could compromise your concentration skills. Also, is very limited, it could be used as one resources to search, and absorb content, but you can't do much more than that. In my opinion, television could be a smart way to educate your children, as it can be funny, and could focus the kid's attention to the television programs. Today, there's many education channels for children, and if they're not used in exaggerated way, I guess, it can help in the education. For adults in another hand, I can't find very useful for education purposes, maybe when you are studying languages, it's nice to get used to the accent, and some more real world vocabulary. To sum up, television is just a tool, like internet, books, etc. The secret for a good education is a dedicated mentor, who analysed, and reflects about what kind of information, is being consumed. The mentor, in case of adults, can be yourself.

"The unknown need: music..." A lot of people think that music is just a composition of sounds, but there are more things in what music is, in my opinion, music can be some kind of mood stabilizer, or a mood enhacer because it has the power to make us feel happy in hard moments, and vice versa. It's something that goes beyond our understanding, so we can ask ourselves the next question: what would life be like without music? I'd say that life would be so monotonous, there wouldn't be that happiness in every reunion, actually, a party is not a party without music. It's hard to think on a world without music, it'd be just like a soundless world, since this is another type of art that has had a lot of influence a long the years in different topics.

In my opinion, I agree with the statement below: 'Computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities.' because of the three main reasons below: Firstly, there is the effectiveness of the computers and tablets. For example, by using computers and tablets, students could access almost all books in a computer so books won't be effective anymore. Also, you can make presentations which you can't make on paper and that's going to help students understand better the lesson that the teacher is teaching. Also, there are plenty of books in libraries of all the schools, which could be replaced by computers. And that brings us to the second reason to agree with the statement above. Secondly, there is the library of schools. There are a lot of books in a library and you could easily make libraries more compact by having all the books in one computer and let the reader select the book they want on a computer and automatically borrowing it. That would be a great idea for replacing books with computers in schools and universities. Also, you wouldn't need a receptionist at the library front desk so it would be more efficient. Lastly, there is the efficiency of the learning and reading. The efficiency is pretty high because you can access pretty much everything from just computers and tablets. For the three main reasons above, I agree with the statement: 'Computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities.'

Music in our lives The music is incredible things. It's like magic. Music means a friend to me, a thinking tool used to clear your mind, and another form of communication. What I mean by this is that whenever I feel like I need to release any emotion, I hear music or make music, emotion is removed from my body, and the happiness I got takes it over. Music is significant. People love music, and music is a great thing. It let me know myself. To us, music is a second life. It is essential. Without music, Earth is a quiet place without any happiness. Only war, fighting, and killing. Every night, have you ever dreamt of your mother singing you a lullaby? It's beautiful. With all the emotion spread away, you'll have a new life with more good things.
