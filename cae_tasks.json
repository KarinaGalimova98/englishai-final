    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about identity theft. For questions 31–36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Identity theft – cases where thieves steal your personal data to rip through your bank or credit card accounts – is a fast-growing crime. Home office statistics estimate a £1.7bn loss over the past 12 months, which, in cash terms, is far ahead of mugging. In the US, where the crime is even more rampant, figures point to a staggering $50bn (about £28bn) a year. The government believes that there are at least 100,000 identity theft victims every year. Others put the figure significantly higher, as some people may not even know their accounts have been raided: identity thieves often stop short of clearing out an account to keep their crime profile low. Identity theft flourishes today because many financial transactions are not face to face. Once criminals get hold of data such as your bank account number and address, they can go on a spending spree. Terrifyingly, they do not need all your details; just a few will do. ‘It’s easy,’ says Glen Hastings, a reformed identity thief and founder of Identity Theft Inc. ‘The only prerequisite is the ability to read and write. It certainly helps to be computer literate, but it’s far from essential. I stole several hundred identities in my career.’ Hastings’ modus operandi was to discover individuals with excellent credit records, the very people banks adore. By impersonating these pillars of financial rectitude, he borrowed large amounts in their name – money that he never, of course, repaid. Even your home could be at risk. Last year, a schoolteacher, who was renting out his unmortgaged Brighton home while he was working in the Far East, was the victim of an audacious identity fraud. A new ‘tenant’ paid six months’ rent in advance but was never to spend a night there, instead, assuming the teacher’s identity using documents and items received through the post at the house. The fraudster managed to remortgage the property for £210,000, which he then took out of the country. It took the unfortunate schoolteacher months of trauma to get his house back. The mortgage company, meanwhile, has never seen a penny of its money back. In the US, one identity victim had her details so closely associated with a $50,000 criminal spending spree that a warrant was put out in her name. The real criminal – who was also a drug dealer – never stopped using the victim’s name, even when caught and imprisoned, which led to further problems. Hastings states that he only stole from ‘banks, casinos, credit card companies, airlines and big stores – never the little guy.’ But we all pay for that, and in any case, most ID thieves are not so selective. And even if you get your money back – most banks and credit card companies treat victims sympathetically – you will still have weeks of worry when you may be unable to access your money and may have to prove that you did not spend £10,000 on internet poker. As an actor, Carolyn Tomkinson is used to taking other people’s identities. But when someone impersonated her and cleaned out her Nationwide account, she knew it wasn’t play-acting. ‘When I found out, I burst into tears,’ she says. ‘It was all my money gone overnight. Colleagues clubbed together and lent some cash, but it was awful – I felt stunned, upset and violated.’ Carolyn had taken £20 from a cash machine the night before, but somehow – probably watching her enter her PIN and clone the card – thieves took £570 from other machines in London, showing a typical fraud pattern in the way they tested her daily limit, then hit her again just after midnight. ‘I discovered it the next day when I wanted to take out a further £20. The machine said I had no further credit available. I then discovered what had happened from the mini-statement. I rang Nationwide, who said they would cancel my card and asked me to report it to the police. The building society was very sympathetic, but said it could take up to six weeks before I got my money back. In the event, it only took a week. ‘I’ve always been very careful, but now I try to avoid ATMs by getting cashback at the supermarket checkout.’ Architectural librarian Claudia Mernick has been ‘cloned’ three times. The third attack was on her credit card. ‘I’d been out buying food one lunchtime. Almost as soon as I got home, the credit card company called me to see how I could have used my card in two places that were far from each other, at the same time. It was an obvious fraud. I was really impressed with their speed. My credit card was cancelled and it took a week or so before I had a new one. But I would like to know what happened and how to avoid it. The thieves didn’t cost me a lot of money but a lot of hassle.’ 31. What is said about identity theft in the first two paragraphs? A. It has caused many criminals to stop mugging people. B. Compared to the US, there is not a serious problem in Britain. C. It can be done so discreetly that the victim is unaware of the crime. D. If an account is not emptied, the victim will probably never realise that they have lost money. 32. According to Glen Hastings A. his computer skills made him exceptionally good as an identity thief. B. banks are only willing to lend money to people who already have a lot of money. C. he had always intended to repay the money he borrowed. D. almost anyone is capable of identity theft. 33. What did the tenant who rented a house from a schoolteacher do? A. He didn’t pay the rent that he’d promised to pay in advance. B. He used the house as security to borrow a large amount of money. C. He sold the house to another individual and then fled the country. D. He pretended to be the schoolteacher and spent all the money in his account. 34. What was the immediate effect of identity theft on Carolyn Tomkinson? A. She was shocked. B. She was angry. C. She felt physically ill. D. She pretended to be more upset than she actually was. 35. What was the situation with Carolyn Tomkinson? A. Her cash card had been stolen. B. The thieves had used her card too many times on the same day. C. The building society managed to stop her card before the thieves could empty her account. D. Her card had been copied. 36. Claudia Mernick’s experience A. shows that the finance company is usually to blame. B. proves that vigilance by the credit card company is crucial when it comes to identity fraud. C. illustrates that only the finance company can detect when a card is being used in a fraudulent way. D. proves that finance companies solve identity fraud cases very quickly."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Bridge under troubled water Sitting at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, the ancient city of Istanbul has seen thousands of years of trade, battles and invasions. Now it is the scene of one of the most audacious engineering projects in the world. 41 Istanbul is divided by the Bosporus strait that connects the Black Sea to the north of the city with the Sea of Marmara to the south. Part of the city lies in Europe, on the western side of the strait, while the rest is in Asia. 42 Recently, a mix of technical expertise, foreign investment and national pride finally came together to make the sultan's dream a reality. This time the plan is not so much to unite an empire as to deliver modern Turks from traffic hell. 43 The plan is first to improve the existing railways on both sides of the strait and then extend them to the coast via tunnels bored through the bedrock. The centre section, under the Bosporus, will be a 1.4-kilometre tube made up of several shorter sections that will be built on land, floated into position and sunk into place. End to end, the tunnel will be 12 kilometres long. 44 The result is what geologists refer to as a right-lateral strike-slip fault, similar in size and type to the San Andreas fault in California. The NAF runs for 1600 kilometres across northern Turkey, and the abutting plates move about 2 to 3 centimetres relative to each other every year. 45 Almost every quake along the NAF in the past 100 years seems to have set up a larger one, to the west. The process appears cyclic: quakes march along the fault in sequence until stress falls below a certain threshold, and then start again after a period of quiet. In 1997, geologists studying the most recent cycle predicted that the next shock would hit near the port city of Izmit, 80 kilometres east of Istanbul. Sure enough, a major quake of magnitude 7.4 struck close to Izmit in August 1999, followed by another in Duzce in December, together killing over 18,000 people and causing $10 to $25 billion of damage. 46 Recent estimates by the US Geological Survey, the University of Tokyo and Istanbul Technical University estimate that the probability of a strong quake hitting Istanbul is up to 44 per cent in the next decade and as much as 77 per cent in the next 30 years. A major earthquake and accompanying tsunami are considered inevitable within a generation. A) Earthquakes along the NAF are common. In the past seven decades, Turkey has endured seven earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. While some earthquakes release the stress that has built up on a fault, seismologists have come to realise that others simply shift it along the fault, leaving it even more prone to slip.B) Two road bridges cross the strait and there are plans for a third, but ever since the Ottoman sultan Abdul Mecit suggested it in 1860, city leaders have dreamed of building a tunnel to link the two halves of the city.C) Seismologists agree that the most recent quakes on the NAF have shifted the stress steadily closer to Istanbul. Now the question isn’t if a major earthquake will strike the city, but when.D) Today, crossing the Bosporus means either a 3-hour trip by rail and ferry, or braving grid lock in narrow, 2000-year-old streets and the two overcrowded road bridges. The Marmaray project, which takes its name from the Sea of Marmara and “ray”, the Turkish word for rail, aims to ease the strain by replacing car traffic with an upgraded rail service that will whisk commuters between Europe and Asia.E) The crucial factor that lets the tunnels withstand quakes of this magnitude is the fact that both are “immersed tubes”. In this design, engineers dig a channel into the seabed and float the fabricated sections into position above it before sinking them and covering them over. The Marmaray tunnel will use a similar approach.F) The Marmaray Rail Tube Tunnel, the first stage of which opened on October 29th, 2013, will not only be the deepest underwater tunnel ever constructed. It will also pass within 16 kilometres of one of the most active geological faults in the world. A major earthquake is not only expected, but also imminent. No wonder the Turkish government is calling it the project of the century.G) It might sound straightforward, but the project engineers face a major geological hurdle. Twenty kilometres south of Istanbul lies the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), where the Anatolian plate that underlies Turkey, Greece and the north Aegean is being squeezed to the south and south-west by the surrounding Arabian, Eurasia and African plates."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of an art exhibition. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Matisse Retrospective Four critics comment on an exhibition of the artist Henri Matisse. A Midway through the museum's retrospective on Matisse, I bumped into the painter Alex Katz. He looked at me, agog, and said , \"I thought I was going to faint when I saw these paintings.\" He gestured at two Matisse still life works from the mid 1940s. Already in a stunned state of my own , I followed his lead and gulped at the revolutionary pictorial power and radical colour radiating off these two powerhouses, one dominated by a celestial red and an arrangement on a table. In the foreground , were either a dog and cat chasing each other, or a pair of animal-skin rugs. Then I looked at the painting next to it, which also showed Matisse's inherent ability to depict form and colour, with stupendous results. I saw the same still life depicted on the same table with the same vase, goblet, and fruit. But this version was totally different. Where the dog and cat were, there's an ultra flat still life within the still life. it's so categorically compressed that it looks less than twodimensional; maybe, one-half-dimensional. I thought I, like Katz, might pass out. B The great French modernist painter Henri Matisse was not a joiner. In the early 20th century, he refused to join any of the popular art movements of the time. He communed with artists of the distant or not-so-distant past, from Giotto to Cezanne, and periodically brushed shoulders with Cubism and the work of his chief rival , Pablo Picasso, from Spain. But his main desire was, as he stated , to \" push further and deeper into true painting\". His evolution, a result of studied attempts to master his art, is the subject of the exhibition at the museum and one of the most thrillingly instructive shows about this painter, or painting in general, that you may ever see. As ravishing as it is succinct, it skims across this French master's long, productive career with a mere 49 paintings, but nearly all are stellar if not pivotal works. c The exhibition at the museum should dispel any doubts about how hard this father of modern art laboured to create the colourful and seemingly insouciant paintings and works on paper that have become so well-known and loved. As the wall texts in the show point out, \"Painting did not, and never had, come easily to Matisse. Throughout his career, he constantly hesitated, questioned, repainted and re-evaluated his work.\" Today it seems clearer than ever that Matisse was, first and foremost, a supreme colourist. His use of pinks and purples, clarets, oranges and crimsons, is more surprising and electric, than any other European's of that generation. Even when you compare him to that other 20th-century giant Picasso, Matisse wins the colour wars hands down (even Picasso admitted it, once). Far from the intuitive, child-like genius that some have imagined him to be, Matisse was someone who turned himself into a major artist through years of prodigious effort. In that respect, he's no different from the vast majority of artists throughout history. D Ravishing colours, flowing lines, sinuous bodies: Henri Matisse made it all look effortless. But it wasn't. Throughout his career Matisse wrestled with the fundamentals of painting; he revisited the same subjects over and over, and he often used completed canvases as models for later ones. Extraordinary insights into his process of creation are laid bare in the eye-opening new exhibition at the museum. The nearly 50 paintings on display reveal how Matisse used older works to generate new ideas. Sometimes the differences are subtle, and sometimes the works are shockingly unalike. But Matisse was using repeated images to push his art further. Later in his career, Matisse hired a photographer to capture his work in the studio. He used photographs of his own paintings to judge whether he was making progress, or whether he'd gone off track. Ultimately, the show reveals Matisse as an artist who made the act of painting into something as important, and as inspiring, as his finished works.37 - Which reviewer unlike the other three reviewers, makes no reference to Matisse’s use of colour in his work?  38 - disagrees with the other three reviewers, in saying that Matisse's ability was innate?  39 - explores some of the techniques Matisse used in his artistic process? 40 - makes comparisons between Matisse and a Spanish artist like reviewer B?"

In which review is the following mentioned? 47) A cheap way to learn how to do an activity. 48) An event opened by young people. 49) Art reflecting life. 50) Watching a film in the fresh air. 51) Watching professionals fighting. 52) The chance to make a long-term investment. 53) Someone who did quite well in a competition. 54) Spending time with contemporary literary celebrities. 55) Music in a religious building. 56) People pretending to be dolls. A) The Brighton festival runs from 1st–23rd May this year, and some 300,000 visitors are expected. More than 700 dance, theatre, music, art and literature events will take place throughout the city, ranging from outdoor events in the Lanes and by the seafront, to theatre and dance in the Dome auditorium. The festival kicks off on May Day in Sydney Street with the \"Children’s Classics\" parade of 4,000 children; they’ll be dressed as characters from the books of authors such as one-time Brighton resident Lewis Carroll. Other events include exhibitions and street performances. There will be a special exhibition of work by recent graduates of the University of Brighton Fine Art Department. All the work will be for sale so it’s a good chance to pick up a potential masterpiece. B) This year’s offerings combine tradition with modern events such as a comedy evening. To help warm up for the festival, which runs from May 5th to the 23rd, a free street festival will take place on 24th April, with human mannequin window displays at Jarrod’s department store, acrobatic skateboarders and life-size garden gnomes. There will also be a beer festival with over 100 real ales and wine tasting offering a selection of British wines. For those people who are more adventurous there will be the opportunity to have a ride in a hot air balloon, weather permitting. There will also be a book exhibition in the park and special storytelling afternoons for children by some of Britain’s leading authors. Or your child can borrow a book and read for himself or herself. C) Promoting its status as one of England’s newest cities, Preston’s International City Festival takes place 11th–20th June. The festival will have an international flavour because this year the Preston Caribbean Festival will be incorporated into the proceedings with a lively carnival and Preston’s Asian community will stage dance, art and music events. The festival will have a gastronomic theme, with demonstrations from some of Europe’s top chefs and cookery workshops given by the city’s Indian and Chinese communities. There will also be a “proms in the park”, an open-air cinema in Avenham Park and a street theatre. D) The Mersey River Festival is the largest maritime event in England this year and will take place around Albert Dock and Pier Head on 18th–21st June. Visiting tall ships will be open to the public. Blue Badge guides will lead tours around Liverpool landmarks such as the Cunard building, and voices will unite for the International Sea Shanty festival. Get into the festival spirit by trying out kayaking, water polo and a variety of other water sports for free at the Watersports Centre. If you sign up for a course of watersports lessons which start after the festival, you will receive a 50% discount. There will also be unarmed combat displays by the Royal Marines to raise money for charity, a river parade, an illuminated narrow boat parade through the docks, and an historic diving exhibition. E) This year’s festival, 21st June – 13th July, celebrates the 10th anniversary of democratic elections in South Africa. Events include a performance by Ladysmith Black Mambazo at St Paul’s Cathedral, a varied programme of South African music at the Spitz Club and a range of free dance events in Guildhall Yard. There will also be performances of Beethoven’s string quartets by the Borodin Quartet at various concert halls, as well as many other classical offerings, dance, theatre and literary events. There will also be an exhibition of art by local youths. The images all illustrate life in the city of London and provide some interesting insights into how London is viewed by its young inhabitants. F) The summer festival in Devon’s principal city takes place 2nd–18th July. Hot tickets are likely to be the audiences with Joan Bakewell and director Ken Russell at the Northcott Theatre and a concert given by Mercury music Prize 2000 nominee Nitin Sawhney. Theatrical offerings include hit comedy Art, directed by Nigel Havers at Escot House, and a world premiere of the English Chamber Theatre’s production of Chekov’s Leading Lady. The 4th of July will also resound to a Latin beat, with dance performances from the Jaleo Flamenco Dance Company taking place around Exeter Quay. The London Community Gospel Choir, the Brodsky Quartet and the New Berlin Chamber Orchestra will also perform during the festival."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about someone who set up their own business. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Starting up your own business My earliest memory is one of incredible trauma. When I was five, my older brother and I crept downstairs on Christmas morning to light candles on the tree, and his pyjamas caught fire. As he ran around the room in flames, I knew I had to fetch a bucket of water, but shock rooted me to the spot and I could do nothing. He's still scarred, and the incident had a lasting impact on me, too. Ever since, I've been driven by a need to help heal other people. When I was 18, I started studying medicine, but I never really got into it. The course wasn't what I'd expected and I took some time out to think about what I really wanted to do. But before I had a chance to start a new course, I'd fallen in love and was married. I was sad to give up my studies but I put our marriage first. We had three children, but by the time the third was born, our relationship was falling apart. After nearly five years, I realised nothing was going to change unless I made it happen myself, so I persuaded my husband to leave. lt was the hardest thing I'd ever done. So there I was, 29, on my own, with three young children to bring up and very little money. Things were bleak. I knew I had to get on with bringing up the children, but there were times I felt I couldn't cope and then I'd go outside, lie on the grass and cry. My salvation was living in such a lovely place - it was so beautiful that just looking at the landscape was a form of therapy. But back then, nature also supported us on a practical level. I realised that if I saved a few potatoes and planted them, I could grow my own. I taught myself as I went along, and learned how to use birch leaves and nettles from the garden to make soups. The children and I would go to the woods to pick blackberries and collect mushrooms and firewood. I also kept bees for honey. I'd always loved the outdoors, but for the first time I found myself looking at plants and thinking about what I could use them for. The children still remember those times as idyllic, but I knew I couldn't go on living like that forever. After a few years, as I built up my confidence, I decided I had to start using my brain again. I considered resurrecting my medical ambitions, but in the end I turned down a place to study medicine in Dundee as it would have meant studying 70 hours a week, which was unfair on the children. Then I heard about a homeopathy course, which was held one weekend a month in Newcastle. it was the midEighties, when homeopathy wasn't so widely accepted, but I had faith in it because my parents had used it. Suddenly I had an energy I hadn't felt for years because I had regained control of my life. Healing people with homeopathy made perfect sense because it is based on the relationship between nature and ourselves, rather than being about automatically prescribing drugs. For the first few years after I qualified, my surgery was a room in my house. lt was exciting - people told their friends about me, so I never had to advertise, but it wasn't easy working from home. The children were very good but I felt guilty telling them they had to be quiet, so I started working from treatment rooms at clinics alongside other complimentary therapists. But before long I found I was working six days a week. it was exhausting travelling between clinics and it dawned on me that with the money I was paying in rent I might as well have my own place. Eight years ago, I opened my own clinic in the centre of Edinburgh. I was totally out of my depth in the beginning and simply looked around until I found premises and took on the lease. I had no savings; I just planned to pay the rent with the money as it came in. I had no idea how to run a business back then. I was so naive I didn't even know you had to pay rates, until I received a huge bill! But I began to realise that running a business is a creative process, too. I was determined that my lack of business skills wouldn't let me down, so I taught myself the basics, kept things simple and, when things went wrong, I learned from my mistakes. Running the clinic was my dream. I have three treatment rooms and I treat my patients in one of them, while the other two are rented to other therapists. There's also a shop where I sell natural healthcare products and natural beauty products that I've made. These days I work six days a week - three days spent treating people and the other three in the shop doing the accounts and making products. I've learned you have to accept the negative things in life and use them to move on. You can't hide from them. it's hard when things go wrong, but it does help to clear out all the things that don't matter and lets you focus on what does. But more than anything, I've realised that it's worth pushing for what you want, because if you are lucky enough to find work you believe in, it can totally transform you. 31.

There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Up, up and away! So you think you're inconvenienced by having to put your personal belongings in a clear plastic bag and arrive at the airport three hours before departure? Imagine how recent security changes are affecting aviation personnel. You don't need to be a regular viewer of 'Airport' to know that commercial airport staff are accountable for all sorts of situations both within and outside of their control. 41._____ Balpa, which has over 9,000 of Britain's airl ine pi lots in membership, wants safety recommendations from pilots to be taken much more seriously. Many pilots feel that the system is making their jobs more difficult rather than improving security. And, of course, with the recent increase in the terrorist threat, a career in aviation might not be the first thing on the mind of the nation's graduates.42._____ North, from Cambridge, is a first officer with KLM. Her job involves fl ying from Amsterdam to various European destinations, checking flight planning and fuel measures. She has wanted to be a pilot since she was very young. \"I went on holiday with my family and was allowed a flight deck visit,\" she says. \"When I saw all the screens and dials I thought, Wow, I want to do that!\"43.________ She says one of the best things about being a pilot is \"the feeling you get when it's pouring with rain and freezing cold on the ground, then when you go flying and pop up through the clouds and it's warm and sunny.\" She continues: \"Sometimes, you have to get up at 2.30 a.m. to get to work and if you are rea lly unlucky you'll get that scheduled six days in a row. There are rules about how long you can work, but after 14 hours on day six ... it's exhausting.\" 44._______ However, despite the cost of training, competition for training positions at flight schools is normal ly fierce. The RAF offers university and sixth form sponsorship for certain RAF careers, and you can receive up to £4,000 a year as an undergraduate. 45._______ Thirty-two-year-old Zoe Goldspink is a senior flight attendant for Virgin Airways. She trained for 6 weeks at the Horley Flight Centre near Gatwick Airport, learning safety, security, customer service and medical training. it's a comprehensive training programme and entry requirements vary from airline to airline. None require a degree but some prefer a European language, most have minimum GCSE requirements and some like experience in a customer service role. 46.______ She believes that since 9/11 there are more security measures in place and she doesn't feel personally threatened. \"There's passenger profiling, baggage screening at the airports, and preventative measures onboard like cockpit CCTV and strengthened cockpit doors. The safety and security of the crew and passengers is the number one priority of all airl ines today. A. Training as a pilot can be a pretty pricey exercise. Costs vary but potential flyers need to have around £60,000 in sponsorship or private wealth. Some airlines offer sponsorship, and some offer methods for borrowing and repaying this money that may be linked to a starting salary. B. One of the most annoying things is delays at check-in. In high season these can be unacceptably long and many people get irate at having to hang around. Terrorist threats have added to this problem of course and I appreciate that, but I still don't see why it takes quite so long. lt drives me mad and so I never fly anywhere unless I really have to. I'm also slightly nervous of flying, so for me it's just a necessary evil. C. Brunei University is offering a BA and MA in aviation engineering and pilot studies. There are also several aviation school s, such as Oxford Aviation Training, which offer full flight training as well as post-qualification selection preparation. All of these courses offer qualifications which are recognised worldwide. D. North won a flying scholarship with the Air Training Corps (Air Cadets) when she was seventeen and used it to get her private pilot's licence. She left the RAF when she won a sponsorship with civilian commercial flying school, Cabair, before joining KLM as a first officer on the Fokker 50. E. Goldspink says the benefits are obvious. \"One minute you can be in New York and then the following week in Hong Kong or on a beach in Barbados. lt does disrupt your social life and sometimes it can be a bit tiring, but there are far more pluses to the job. I love being cabin crew. it's the endless variety that appeals so much to me.\" F. But it's not all terrifying, says Kate North. \"Exciting, perhaps. Thankfully, confidence in the industry remains strong and it seems more people are flying than ever before. Obviously, there is increased security at UK airports but that is necessary for the safety and wellbeing of all passengers. I think most passengers appreciate that.\" G. Other than doctors and nurses, there are few people whose hands we put our lives in so readily. We are not in control of our fate when we are passengers on a plane. Travelling 30,000 feet in the air with nothing for company except an in-flight magazine, tensions can run high."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a film. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. The King's Speech Four critics comment on the film A History and fi lm buffs wi ll delight in Seidler's The King's Speech . Its strong historical context might deter those not falling within these two categories, however. The film largely involves the actors Colin Firth, formal and decent, and Geoffrey Rush, large and expansive, in psychological struggle. Helena Bonham Carter, who can be merciless, is here fi lled with mercy, tact and love for her husband; this is the woman who became the much-loved Queen Mother of our lifetimes, dying in 2002 at I 0 I. As the men have a struggle of wills, she tries to smooth things and raise her girls Elizabeth and Margaret. In the wider sphere, Hitler takes power, war comes closer, and the dreaded day approaches when Bertie (Firth), as George VI, will have to speak to the world and declare war. The director's handling of that fraught scene is masterful. Firth internalises his tension and keeps the required stiff upper lip, but his staff and household are terrified on his behalf as he marches towards a microphone as if it is a guillotine. At the end, what we have here is a superior historical drama and a powerful personal one. B Some films turn out to be unexpectedly good. Not that you've written them off, only they ply their craft on the hush-hush. Tom Hooper's The King's Speech, looked no more than a well-spoken costume drama, optimistically promoted for Sunday tea-time: decent cast, nice costumes and posh carpets. That was until the film finished a sneak-peak at a festival in deepest America and the standing ovations began. Tweeters, bloggers and Internet spokespeople of various levels of elocution, announced it the Oscar favourite, so it arrives in our cinemas with a fanfare of trumpets. But for all its pageantry, it isn't a film of grandiose pretensions. Much better than that, it is an honest-to-goodness crowd pleaser. Rocky with dysfunctional royalty. Good Will Hunting set amongst the staid pageantry and fussy social mores of the late 30s. A film that will play and play. A prequel to The Queen . Where lies its success? Let's start with the script, by playwright David Seidler, a model for transforming history into an approachable blend of drama and wit. For a film about being horrendously tongue-tied, Seidler's words are exquisitely measured, his insight as deep as it is softly spoken . c W. H. Auden wrote his poem \"September I, 1939\" while sitting in a New York bar: \"Uncertain and afraid I As the clever hopes expire I Of a low dishonest decade.\" The King's Speech takes a rather different view of Britain and the 1930s, though it's not entirely inconsistent with Auden's judgment and isn't in any sense what is sneeringly called, 'heritage cinema'. lt is the work of a highly talented group of artists who might be regarded as British realists. The film is the private story of a famous public man, King George VI (known in his family circle as Bertie), the woman who loved him and became his queen and the innovative Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, who helped him control and come to terms with the stammer that had tortured him since childhood. Although the film involves a man overcoming a serious disability, it is neither triumphalist nor sentimental. Its themes, which are of universal appeal, are courage, where it comes from, how it is used, responsibility, and the necessity to place duty above personal pleasure or contentment -the subjects, in fact, of such enduringly popular movies as Casablanca. D lt could have been a bunch of pip-pip, stiff-upper-lip Brit blather about a stuttering king who learns to stop worrying and love the microphone. Instead, The King's Speech, a crowning achievement powered by a dream cast, digs vibrant human drama out of the dry dust of human history making it a real crowd-puller. King George VI (Col in Firth), father of the present Queen Elizabeth, found his own Dr. Strangelove in Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a wildly eccentric Australian speech therapist who made it possible for the stammering monarch to go on radio in 1939 and rally his subjects to support the declaration of war on Hitler's Germany. The King's Speech plays out on the battlefield of words, not action. Writer David Seidler breathes fresh, urgent life into every frame of this powerhouse. The film's director Tom Hooper, 37, is a prodigious talent. The emotion this film produces is staggering. Which reviewer 37.does not make a comparison between The King 's Speech and another film? 38. highlights the work of the film's writer like reviewer D? 39. like reviewer D, was forced to re-assess any preconceptions they had had about the film? 40.disagrees with the other three reviewers, in saying The King's Speech does not have popular appeal?"

JOBS A. The writer I'm often accused of living in a parallel universe. The nature of my job demands a natural inclination to all things weird and wonderful. After all, I'm creating an unreal world based on what I see, feel, and experience. I don't remember a time when I didn't write, but I never had aspirations to earn a living from it until a cousin of mine entered a short story I'd written into a national competition — and I won! It was a bolt out of the blue, seeing as I knew nothing about the competition. The cash prize was substantial, so I shared it with my enterprising cousin. Now she tries to claim commission on royalties of every book I have published — not that she has any luck! B. The postal worker I love the freedom of my job. You are out on the streets delivering, and there is no one to bother you — well, with the exception of the local wildlife, of course. I've had a few close encounters with a canine jaw or two, but no actual bites. I'm a fast runner when need be. I'm not so sure that some of the letters I deliver survive some of the cuddly dogs that rip them out of my hand as they go through the letter box. In some houses I can hear great snarling and ripping noises as I walk away from the door. Still, once they are through that box, they're no longer my responsibility. Seriously though, it can give you a warm feeling inside sometimes when someone is waiting for something special, and they look so happy when you deliver it. Exam results — now that's an emotional one. Poor kids, you see them looking out of a window or even hanging around outside their house, just waiting for me to come along with that dreaded envelope that will affect their whole future. C. The teacher It's not a job for the fainthearted, that's for sure. But on the other hand, I think people make it out to be worse than it is. The majority of the time, things run very smoothly — well, as smoothly as they can with a building containing over a thousand kids. It's a fascinating job when you think about it, all those little personalities developing in front of your eyes. The wonderful thing is when they stay in touch and come back on regular visits to keep you up to date on how their life is panning out. And then you feel really old as their children come along, and you end up teaching the next generation. D. The actor My brothers always say that I've never had a proper job in my life. That's just because they are jealous, since they are stuck in nine-to-five jobs. We were always competitive with each other as kids, and I guess we still are in some ways. They crave my freedom, but I admire their skills as fathers. I love acting, but I sometimes wonder if I've missed out on the traditional way of life. Maybe the stability of a 'proper' job would be more rewarding in the long run. It must be great to have workmates that you've known for years and joked with day in, day out. And office Christmas parties — now they sound like fun. E. The au pair My job is quite strange if you think about it. I move into the home of complete strangers, and overnight I become an integral part of the family. It can often be hard for the children to adjust to a new au pair. Sometimes they are a bit resentful because they want more of their parents' attention, and the au pair is considered, at best, a poor substitute, and at worst, an invader in the family home. We are trained to deal with such issues, though, and have techniques to help us win the trust of the children and to make them see that having an au pair is a positive thing in their life. Usually things turn out well in the end, and it can be a real wrench when you leave a family. I've stayed in touch with all the families that I've worked for. F. The bus driver I wouldn't say my job is particularly stressful. Some of the other drivers grumble about traffic and rude passengers, but I think that you get what you give — and if I give people a cheery \"good morning\", they are going to respond in a positive way towards me. That's not to say there aren't a fair few idiots on the road. Some drivers think they have a divine right to go wherever they want without paying any attention to fellow road users, and others have a thing about buses and feel obliged to overtake them at all costs and in any situation, whether it is safe or not. There's a real sense of camaraderie among the drivers, and we have a good laugh together in the depot canteen. With this job, you've got to keep a smile on your face."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about two women who walked up mount Kilimanjaro. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. We climbed a mountain When I set off to climb Kilimanjaro, I was 45, overweight, stressed out and trapped in an unhappy marriage. My best friend, Siobhan, had heard about a fundrai sing trip, organised by the charity Whiz Kidz, on the radio. As we were pounding the treadmill in the gym, she said, \"Hey Tracey, let's cl imb a mountain.\" I said, \"You must be mad,\" but the idea was firmly planted in our minds from that moment. Like so many women in my situation, I felt I had no time for me, and no time to make choices. I worked full time for an advertising agency; a stimulating but stressful job that left me mentally exhausted. My husband David was, and is, a fantastic father but, like many men, he has no idea about tidying up and day-to-day chores like washing and cleaning. So I ran our home almost single-handedly. When I wasn't at work I was rushing about trying to get everything sorted out, and weekends were spent ferrying my two daughters to all their activities - trying to make up for not being there during the week. Siobhan set the ball rolling on the trip, and our fir st hurdle was raising £3000 each. We had a fantastic time doing it, because it was so different from the rest of our lives - organising a ball for 150 people, going carol singing and running a school disco. When we started training for the trip I was about three stone overweight, so we hired a personal trainer, went to the gym and took long walks in the hills. There were 35 of us on the trip, and Siobhan and I were the only middle-aged women. There were young guys who'd run marathons and girls in their 20s, but the age gap didn't matter. In fact, we were the practical ones, the leaders. The climb took four days going up, two days coming down. After just two days we were filthy. Sometimes the young girls would be in tears because they couldn't get anything clean and Siobhan became like a mother hen. lt was hot during the day and freezing at night, and we slept six to a hut. My lips blistered so badly I could hardly speak, and my feet were in agony. I kept up with the others until the very last climb, which you had to do at night because otherwise the sun was too strong. We pitched camp at about 18,000ft - just a thousand feet from the summit. But the going was very tough, over loose scree, and you literally had to scramble hand over hand. We set off in the dark wearing head torches, in a long straggling line. A full moon lit our path, but as we climbed I felt worse and worse. it was so cold, I couldn't feel my fingers, and I felt so dizzy I was staggering about like a drunk. After six hours I passed out. I had altitude sickness really badly and a porter had to lead me back down gently. They wanted to put me in a decompression chamber, but I refused - I didn't think I was that ill. it was only later I realised I could have died from a cerebral oedema, where excess fluid collects on the brain, making it swell up. The walk back to the hut should have taken two hours but it took four - possibly the hardest four hours of my life. When I got back I collapsed on my sleeping bag and slept. Siobhan, meanwhile was making her way up to the top. When I woke I was crying because I hadn't made it and she wa s up there. I was determined to be on my feet to welcome her back. Against the guide's wishes, I managed to climb back up the trail for an hour and stand on the side of the trail, crying and emotional as she came back. Even though I hadn't made it to the top, I didn't feel like I'd failed. I realised that I had achieved something just for me. We ended up raising £9,000 for Whiz Kidz which was fantastic and the personal achievement put everything else into perspective. lt made me realise you don't have to put up with situations - you do have a choice. There are infinite opportunities out there, and women are brilliant at seizing them. You don't have to have a man by your side to feel complete. I now feel that I'm really li ving, and getting what I want out of life. And next year Siobhan and I are planning to walk the Inca Trail together. 31. Tracey and Siobhan’s decision to climb Kilimanjaro can be described as A. practical, B. desperate, C. unrealistic, D. impulsive. 32. In order to prepare for the trip Tracey and Siobhan A. had to be a specific weight, B. had to tackle new challenges, C. did a lot of socialising with the people they were about to travel with, D. joined a choir. 33. How did Tracey and Siobhan fit into the group dynamics? A. They were outsiders because they were so much older than the others, B. They were envious of the younger girls, C. Their maternal instincts led them to support the younger members, D. They had to make a big effort to be accepted into the group. 34. What happened to Tracey towards the end of the trip? A. She refused to give up even though she was very ill, B. She was forced to admit defeat due to ill health, C. She was too emotional to carry on to the top, D. The others refused to help her to the summit. 35. When Tracey didn’t reach the summit she A. accepted that the experience had been of value, B. was envious of Siobhan, C. could not get over her sense of failure, D. felt relieved that the experience was at last over. 36. The writer seems to intend this piece to be A. cautionary, B. pretentious, C. inspirational, D. cultural."

There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Alexandria Smoke and the fragrance of roasting quail float up from long charcoal grills lining the perimeter of Suq ei-Attarine, the Market of Scents, in Alexandria, Egypt. lt is October, the season when quail fly south from Europe, tire over the Mediterranean Sea, land on beaches, and are easily trapped . Along pavements men sit on benches and puff apple-cured tobacco through water pipes. Some play dominoes. Above us hang the purple flowers of jacaranda trees. 41.______ Nearly half the world's population lives in cities. The number of megacities - those with populations of more than ten million -will exceed two dozen by 20 IS, up from fourteen in 1995. But what is it that draws people to cities like bees to pollen? 42._____ I decided to commence my investigations here because this was one of the few international cities in the world. lt was part of Africa, close to Arabia, and home to Europeans from Greece and Rome. Alexandria was a crossroads for trade that ranged from China to Britain. Strabo, a geographer in the first century A. D . called Alexandria \"the greatest emporium in the inhabited world.\" After Alexandria, I will visit Cordoba, Spain, western Europe's largest city in A. D. I 000, now a modest town supported mainly by agriculture. In its prime Cordoba was, in the words of one observer, \"the mother of towns, the abode of the good and godly, the homeland of wisdom.\" My travels will end in New York City, a modern epicentre of finance and culture. New York, writes Joan Did ion, is \"an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power.\" 43._________ Alexander's engineers realised that Mediterranean currents running west to east would keep the port navigable and free of Nile River silt. They also knew that the Island of Pharos, if joined to the mainland by the construction of a pier, would offer an effective wave breaker. 44._________ In the 14th century it collapsed during an earthquake, and the Egyptians built a fortress here using. some accounts say, stones from the lighthouse. From my waterside cafe table I can see the fortress where team members from the Alexandria-based Centre d'Etudes Alexandrines are easing into wet suits. They will dive down 20 feet where they are cataloguing statues, columns, and other architectural elements near the lighthouse site. 45.________ The idea of a place of records was not new. A building was constructed in 3200 B.C. to house a collection of Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and Athens had a simi lar building in the fourth century B.C. But Alexandria's library was on a scale new to the Mediterranean world, and the city was notorious for its aggressive pursuit of texts. Mohen Zahran the project manager talks about reviving \"the lighthouse of knowledge\". The new library, he says, \"will encourage the peace and exchange of ideas throughout the region and provide a place for scholars of diverse backgrounds to meet.\" 46.________ Scholarly pursuits had immediate commercial applications. Translations helped Alexandrians to better understand their trading partners, and new maps enabled traders to calculate distances more accurately. lt was this wealth of knowledge that helped Alexandria to establish itself as one of the richest cities of its day. A The city grew steadily as a centre for trade. About four decades after Alexander's death in 323 B.C. Ptolemy 11 built a lighthouse, known as one of the seven wonders of the world. lt rivalled the Pyramids in height at about 400 feet and had as many as 300 rooms. Fires, reflected in mirrors on top of the lighthouse, could be seen for some 35 miles, alerting ships to Egypt's reefs and shifting coastline. B l.Jttle is known about how the ancient Mouseion operated because so few written records have been found. But we do know that it was a place for scholars to meet. From throughout their known world Alexandria's rulers invited nearly a hundred learned men to the Mouseion where they lived in a communal residence and ate together in a dining hall. From these scholars came Euclidean geometry, the first scientific dissections of human bodies, a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek and a compilation of Homer's epic poems. C The tranquil scene recalls earlier times in the city that Alexander the Great founded more than 2,300 years ago. But as I stroll from the marketplace toward the harbour, I am clearly in a modern city. Apartment buildings, home to nearly three and a half million people, surround me. Traffic jams the street s. Supermarkets, cell phones, motorcycles, and teenagers in baseball caps are everywhere. D But, back to Egypt and the hustle and bustle of Alexandria. Dodging cars speeding along EIHorreyah Avenue, Alexandria's busiest street, I arrive at the waterfront. I see small fi shing boats at anchor, young boys jumping off rocks into the water, and, beyond, the natural harbour that Alexander the Great saw in 331 B.C .. E The past - and the answers it might hold - feel s impossibly distant as I wander up the coast near where Cleopatra's palace once stood. Somewhere in this area, perhaps beneath my feet, lies the sarcophagus holding Alexander the Great. lt disappeared from recorded history in the third century A.D. Also buried here in a site yet to be located is the famous Alexandria library, founded early in the third century B.C. as part of the Mouseion, the great research centre of its day. F All cities share certain characteristics. They are places to buy and sell, to worship, to share companionship.

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a novel. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Atonement Four critics comment on the novel A. Atonement does not feel, at first, like a book by McEwan. The opening is almost perversely ungripping. Instead of the expected sharpness of focus , t he first 70 or so pages are a lengthy summary of shifting impressions. One longs for a cinematic clarity and concentration of dialogue and action, but such interludes dissolve before our - and the participants' - eyes. Unlike Martin Amis, say, or Salman Rushdie, McEwan is an invisible rather than a flamboyant stylist. Even so, the pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs (a 'gently rocking sheet of water, the 'coyly drooping' head of a nettle) come as a surprise. The language used to distil the scene - a gathering of the Tallis family at their country house on a sweltering day in 1935 - serves also as a wash that partially obscures it. B. lan McEwan's remarkable novel Atonement is a love story, a war story and a story about the destructive powers of the imagination. lt is also a novel that takes all of the author's perennial themes - dealing with the hazards of innocence, the hold of time past over time present and the intrusion of evil into ordinary lives - and orchestrates them into a symphonic work that is every bit as affecting as it is gripping. lt is, in short, a tour de force. The story t hat Atonement recounts. concerns a monstrous lie told by a I 3-year-old girl. a lie that will send her older sister's lover away to jail and that will shatter the family's staid , upper-middle-class existence. As in so many earlier McEwan's novels, this shocking event will expose psychological fault lines running through his characters' lives and force them to confront a series of moral choices. lt will also underscore the class tensions that existed in England of the 1930s and the social changes wrought by World War 11. C. If you knew for a fact that you'd ruined someone's life - two lives, really- how would you make amends? That's the question the stark title of lan McEwan's beautiful but wrenching, well-paced new novel refers to. Atonement is about a crime and its consequences over the course of six decades: In the mid-thirties, a precocious young girl with an overactive imagination helps to wrongly accuse an innocent man , and it is not until 1999 that she finds a kind of absolution. But this book, McEwan's grandest and most ambitious yet, is much more than the story of a single act of atonement. In his compact and clockwork-precise earlier fictions, McEwan, whose previous novel Amsterdam won the Booker in 1998, liked to show how relationships and people can disintegrate in ways that manage to seem both shocking and inevitable. D. Minor resemblances between this novel by lan McEwan and Henry James's What Maisie Knew have already been noticed and are of some interest. McEwan's new novel , which strikes me as easi ly his finest, has a frame that is properly hinged and jointed and apt for the conduct of the 'march of action', which James described as 'the only thing that really, for me, at least, w ill produce L'Oeuvre.' Not quite how McEwan would put it, perhaps. but still t he substance of his method, especial ly if one adds a keen technical interest in another Jamesian obsession , the point of view. H is central character is a 13-year-old girl called Briony, already a maker of stories and plays and so already a writer of fict ions that have only their own kind of truth and are dependent on fantasies which readers are invited to share. with whatever measure of scepticism or credulity they can muster. Which reviewer 37. like reviewer A, makes comparisons between McEwan and other writers? 38. disagrees with the other three reviewers, by finding the novel's structure  unsatisfactory? 39. believes this to be the author’s best work to date? 40. examines the question of morality in the piece like reviewer C?"

    "text": "You are going to read some extracts from a travel magazine about places to visit. For questions 47-56, choose from the extracts (A-F). The extracts may be chosen more than once. In which extract is the following mentioned?  47 People of different social classes are working together to improve the community. 48 There are no buildings to spoil this area. 49 There are specific things that you must take with you on this trip. 50 There is a slight risk of serious injury or even death on this trip. 51 Different eras can be compared in this place. 52 A political change had an unexpectedly good outcome. 53 A place used by several monarchs. 54 A remarkable form of transport. 55 The near total destruction of a population in one area. 56 A trip for artistic people. Places to visit around the world A Preah Vihear, Cambodia This enigmatic temple/ fortress near the Thai/ Cambodian border welcomed tourists until, in 1993, the Khmer Rouge settled here. Though they soon left, it was ten years before Preah Vihear was completely reopened - Cambodia finally finished the access road in 2003. The original temple was started in the 9th century, although it was subsequently maintained and enlarged by many different kings. For the makers, the cracking views were incidental: building the temple on a mountain was designed to encourage religious meditation. The best way to reach Preah Vihear is to hire a driver or join a coach party from Siem Reap. If you go under your own steam you might want to stay overnight in the basic accommodation at the foot of the mountain or the even more primitive accommodation atop the 550m peak. The area has been largely cleared of land mines but it's probably best to stick to the main paths. B Gorgongosa National Park Ten years ago, thi s magnificent wildlife park in central Mozambique was an environmental disaster area. In 1971, 12,000 visitors came here, attracted by the greatest lion population in Africa. From 1983 to 1992, the park was the stage for many battles in Mozambique's civil war. By 1992, when peace arrived, the park's stock of large mammals had fallen by 95%. The park, a day's drive from the capital Maputo, was partially reopened in 1998. Gorgongosa's recovery has gathered momentum this year. Buffalo have been reintroduced and the park has received donations from internet mogul Greg Carr and rock star Ronnie Wood. lt may be a while before the cheetah and rhino return but 1,862mhigh Mount Gorgongosa is still an unforgettable hike. C Johannesburg Johannesburg is a bustling modern city set against the grandeur of African horizons. lt was here Nelson Mandela began the revolution that destroyed apartheid, and today the same spirit lives on in the diverse population - they are now living the new South African dream. After the end of Apartheid in 1994, many felt the change to democratic government would spell decline. That simply hasn't happened - instead, the negative image of the city has taken a turn for the better. Johannesburg has an edge, no-one can deny that, but recently it has shaken off its reputation for grime and crime. The centre of town is beginning a hesitant renaissance - restaurants are multiplying, the theatre is booming - while its outer suburbs are flourishing. This is a city where, against all odds, people from all walks of life are coming together and forging something new. D Northern India Palanquin Traveller has a new programme of cultural studies on location, designed to satisfy the seriously inquisitive traveller. Origins of the Buddha is a journey across northern India travelling in the Buddha's footsteps. Visiting important sites in Buddha's life is not just for pilgrims - this expedition stays in rural villages and homes to get a better understanding of how modern and traditional India strive to co-exist. The tour is led by scholar Shantum Seth, who is not only a charismatic companion and fascinating guide, but also an adviser to the UN and Unesco. This thirteen-day trip involves some challenging trekking and basic mountain climbing so appropriate clothing and footwear is essential. Accommodation and all food included in holiday price. E Estonia Would you like to spend your next holiday in an Eastern European bog? This may seem like a daft idea, until you realise 50% of Estonia is made up of virgin forest, including some of the most glorious and pristine bogs in Europe. The landscape is unmarred by human construction, save the boardwalks that penetrate this soggy countryside as shown on 'Light and Land's' new photography trip to Estonia. Mineral islands amongst the murky pools provide a haven for wildlife - bears, lynx, flying squirrels and elk - and denning sites for Estonia's thriving wolf population. Point your lens upwards to the peaks of the ancient pines and you'll find an array of birdlife from golden eagles to white-backed woodpeckers. On the ground, there's a host of curious flora and wild flowers including orchids, bittercress and lady's slipper. Led by wildlife enthusiast and photographer Niall Benvie, this is an unusual and rewarding trip to a wilderness in Europe. F Sail the Galapagos This really is the trip of a lifetime. This seven-day expedition is in association with the Galapagos Conservation Trust. Sailing on the Sagitta is an experience in itself - three masts tower above this handsome tall ship and sails ripple into action as she sets off around the archipelago to mingle with the world's friendliest wildlife. This trip is led by Galapagos naturalist, author and photographer David Horwell. Pick his brains on the local fauna and flora over the scrumptious Ecuadorian food on board. Help collect data for the Trust and be part of a team of select scientists for a fortnight. Contribute to the effort to conserve this magical part of the world. This truly is a 'green holiday' where tourist becomes conservationist rather than destroyer of the planet"

A week of letters This week I've been showered with accolades. it's been a week of extremely strange, wonderful letters. One letter I received was from the University of Kent, inviting me to accept an honorary PhD, to be made a Doctor of Letters this summer. I was really chuffed and quite taken aback. I kept having to explain to people: \"But you're not a real doctor. People don't actually call you a doctor.\" The other week I was on a plane where they actually asked: \"Is there a doctor on board?\" And then quickly followed with the words: \"Medical doctor\". I said to my friend: \"Lucky they got that in quick or half the plane would be on their feet.\" A few years ago, I was made an Honorary Fellow by Kent Institute of Art and Design. My gown and puffy hat really suited me and I was quite proud of them. Once when I was a guest speaker at the Oxford Union, I said to the union President, about half-an-hour before the talk: \"Is there somewhere where I can change into my gown?\" At which he just presumed I meant a dress by some top fashion designer. When I appeared in my university gown and hat he said: \"Where did you get that from?\" I replied: \"What? Do you think I stole it?\" and I remember, when I walked into the grand hall, I'd never heard so many wolf whistles. But it is odd that if you are a little bit rough around the edges, and you have a good education, let's say you went to a good university, people somehow think that your dad must have pulled a few strings to get you there. I must admit it really winds me up the way that people make assumptions about you just from the way that you speak. it's not so much about a regional accent, it's more a class thing. I try to take people as I find them. You never know what you might miss out on if you dismiss somebody from the first moment you meet them. I like being a doctor of letters. I think it suits me. And people who know me really well know that I like sending all manner of missives and notes through the post. I like it in an old-fashioned kind of way. it's how I imagine myself being when I am old and happy, sitting cosy by the fire with a cat who has broken the Guinness Book of Records for being the oldest cat on the planet. Happily sitting there, writing letters and sending them out into the ether. I love that familiar plop as a letter or package lands on the floor by my front door. There's always the excitement of the unknown as you go to open it. I guess I'm just like a kid at Christmas wondering what's inside the sparkling parcel. I have received some cracking letters this week. One from Africa - an ex-mercenary putting me straight. it's a fascinating letter that describes the whole history of the mercenaries. it was a very thoughtful, sophisticated letter - something which would be quite hard to achieve in conversation. That's what is so amazing about letters, there's a timelessness about them, where the thoughts hang in space and then you have time to deal with these thoughts. Especially in terms of an argument which, for the record, I am absolutely useless at. I have no chance of ever winning an argument. I am too emotional and react very immaturely to certain situations. Back to the letters. I had a lovely one from the NSPCC who want to induct me into the third NSPCC Hall of Fa me for the support I have given them over the last few years. I became all teary when I read the letter. When you speak on behalf of people or children who don't have a voice, that's the reward in doing it, hoping that you are making a difference somewhere. But to be honoured for doing it is really lovely. Even my cat received a letter today with a big pack of cat food. The letter was really cute and put a smile on my face. But not as half as big a smile as the letter I received last Friday. \"May I offer my sincere apologies that you did not receive the letter of 28th November. I have the greatest pleasure in inviting you, on behalf of the Council and Senate of the College, to accept an Honorary Doctorate of the Royal College of Art\" - a double doctorate! Now who shall I write to tell them my news? 31.How did the writer feel about receiving the letter from the University of Kent? A. She had been expecting to receive something like that. B. She was quite arrogant about it. C. She wasn’t quite sure what it entailed. D. It came out of the blue. 32. The President of the Oxford Union A. assumed that she only wore fashionable clothes. B. deliberately offended her. C. thought she looked ridiculous in her gown. D. had preconceptions about her. 33. The writer believes that A. too many people rely on their parents to help them out in life. B. she lives in a generally classist society. C. her father could have done more to help her. D. she has missed out on a lot of opportunities in the past. 34. Why did the ex-mercenary write to her? A. To introduce her to his particular field of interest. B. To inform her on a subject that she had misunderstood. C. To try to persuade her to support a particular cause. D. To help her with an educational study. 35. The writer believes that letters A. are the most sophisticated form of modern communication. B. will remain when all other forms of communication no longer exist. C. let the reader absorb information and formulate a response. D. incite argument more than speech does. 36. Why is the writer so pleased in the final paragraph? A. Because she has gained more public recognition. B. Because she has finally received an apology from The Royal College of Art. C. Because she finds the idea of her cat getting a letter very amusing. D. Because she doesn’t know if she should write lots of letters."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a newspaper article. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Bad moods aren’t necessarily bad for you. A two-minute film of penguins is a sure-fire way to improve a person's mood. There's something about penguins slip-sliding on the ice that seems to make everyone smile, a fact that psychologists have put to good use in their laboratory investigations of mood. 41 Moods, and bad moods in particular, often appear to come from nowhere. We all have a tendency to notice the negative feelings rather than the positive feelings, but the good news is that we are happier than we tend to think. When a leading Canadian psychologist asked people to keep a diary of every mood they experienced throughout the day, it was the negative moods that predominated. But when he paged the people at random intervals and asked them how they were feeling at that exact moment, it was clear that they felt good most of the time. 42 Moods are not just feelings we experience; they affect the way our minds work. When we are feeling happy we notice a lot of what's going on around us, but the moment anxiety strikes our attention narrows. If you're phobic about spiders, once you realise you're in a room with a spider, you focus on that and disregard almost everything else. 43 Moods even influence the way we retrieve memories. A person feeling sad finds it easier to remember other sad occasions, while a happy person remembers other happy times. This can make it hard to shake off a bad mood. While you sit fuming with anger that a friend of yours has upset you, happy events do not tend to pop into your head. Instead you are more likely to think of other times when friends have let you down. 44 Hope – the feeling that good things might happen in the future – is so powerful that it can even affect our health. Hope gives us energy, and research has shown that hopeful people are more likely to succeed in work, in sport, in academia and in politics. They are also happier and better at both persevering with a task and solving problems. 45 Positive emotions have clear and tangible benefits – hope can even make you live longer. But however destructive they seem, even temper tantrums and sulks have their uses. Emotions are all about communication. They give us information about the way other people feel. If no one ever got angry with you or stopped talking to you, you might never know you had upset them. 46 Looking at the research on moods, it is clear that we don't need to be afraid of our negative emotions. We imagine that it's essential to get control of our bad moods, and it's true that emotional management is a crucial part of our personal development and relationships. But there is another aspect to our emotional ups and downs: our feelings have important things to tell us, and we do well to listen to them. A In one study, which shows just what sort of ramifications this could have, job interviewers who were feeling happy (because they'd just been told they had done well on a test) rated applicants more positively and were more likely to say they would hire them. Meanwhile, the interviewers who were told they had done badly on the test viewed applicants less favourably. B Now, it could be argued that this is all a media stunt. Following a thoroughly frustrating half hour listening to unbearable music while you wait to get through to a call centre, only to find that they cannot solve your problem, you might well feel pretty angry. But eventually, and probably without consciously thinking about it, you will distract. You are employing coping strategies to help to change your mood. C If words are flashed up on a computer screen it takes us longer to read a word associated with our anxieties than other words. So people with eating disorders take a fraction of a second longer to read words such as 'food' and 'meal' than everyone else. Because these words make a person anxious, they actually slow down their thinking. D Also, anger readies our bodies for attack, giving us extra vigour that might prove essential in a fight. No other emotion is able to keep the body at a high pitch for such long periods. Energy is directed towards the muscles, a feature that many sports people use to their advantage, deliberately stoking up their anger towards their opponent. E One reason why hopeful people succeed is that they set themselves higher goals and more goals at a time, which buffers them against disappointment if one plan does not work out. In one extraordinary study, students' feelings of hope when they started college were a better predictor of their final results six years later than their entrance exam marks. Levels of hope even foretold the students who were later to drop out. F Indeed we are far more likely to notice and remember negative moods. Whether it's anger, fear or pure joy, moods can feel overwhelming and beyond our control. Just one careless comment or email can trigger a new mood. They change very fast. G Take part in an experiment on mood and the chances are that you will be shown a video of penguins. Over the past decades, in particular, psychologists have been using such laboratory experiments to investigate what moods are and why it is that they can fire us up one moment and drain us of energy the next."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of visiting Venice during Christmas time. For questions 37–40, choose from reviews A–D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Venice for Christmas. Four critics comment on the experience. A I first saw Venice in June 1984. It was a sewer. I had arrived in Rome with an insane man (a misanthropic friend with all the composure of a bag of cats), his new wife, and an image of myself sitting in a white suit in the Piazza San Marco listening to violins while pigeons flew. Lord knows where this image came from. I had never read Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice nor seen Katharine Hepburn in Summertime. I picked up the suit in Rome, ditched my friends and drove to Florence and on to Venice. At a mediocre trattoria on my first evening, I met a photographer, a young woman from Mexico travelling through Italy. After snapping a picture of me in the suit, standing among the pigeons in the Piazza San Marco while violins whined the Beatles, she skipped town. Following a quick tour of the Doge's Palace, I also fled Tyrol. B My dream has always been to spend Christmas in Venice, during the off-peak season. This was brought on by reading a travel article about a writer who did just that years ago – it sounded just magical. This year my dream came true. I have always had a real passion for Venice and with my love of photography, it’s a totally unique destination. My husband Brian and I spent 12 days in Venice for Christmas and New Year and we revelled in the absence of ostentatious decorations that are unfortunately so common back home. We left home on the 21st of December arriving in glorious sunshine that lasted for the whole holiday. There is nothing more pleasurable than arriving by water taxi, especially with the light streaming onto the palazzi of the Grand Canal, turning them to burnished gold with the light once again reflected back into the canal streaked gold and blue; just divine, and the thing of Venice legends. Speeding along towards the Grand Canal it’s the light that seduces you every time and makes you feel so very alive. C Venice at Christmas time is truly magical. The misty grey weather makes Venice hauntingly beautiful and absolutely enchanting. Canals seem to belong, once again, to those long-lost centuries; past and ancient palaces seem to float upon white clouds. Ancient history and magical kingdoms meet in a delightful experience you'll never forget. Venice at Christmas is surprisingly lacking the tourist crowds. Instead, you'll find it full of locals and Christmas markets. Most of the main squares or campos have a market. Plenty of delightful Christmas concerts are held throughout Venice. They are easily discovered by reading the posters around the city or asking your hotel for advice. La Pietà church on the Riva degli Schiavoni, where Vivaldi was once choir master, hosts some of the best. If you would like to experience Venice in all its magnificence and you have a big budget for sumptuous luxury, then the following hotels are the ones I can recommend. D True to its authentic nature, Christmas is not a big commercial event in Venice. Typical Christmas decorations such as lights, garlands and trees are confined to the busiest parts of the city: the Merceria, the Rialto and San Marco – mercifully not thronged with masses of tourists at this time of year. Occasionally, one can see a window or a balcony timidly decorated. Nativity scenes, or presepi, on the other hand, are much dearer to the Italians. After all, the first Nativity scene is said to have been the creation of Saint Francis. It was a living one and took place in Greccio, a small town south of Assisi, in 1223. Christmas trees, Germanic in origin, came to Italy, and the rest of the world, via England and the United States and much later than the presepi. You can find Christmas trees in Venice, even natural ones, but only rarely in public areas. Which reviewer 37 disagrees with the other three reviewers, finding Venice over-crowded and unpleasant?  38  like D, refers to the understated way that Venetians celebrate Christmas? 39 like C, refers to the captivating nature of Venice?  40  comments on the lack of tourists at Christmas time in the city?

    "text": "You are going to read some horoscopes. For questions 47–56, choose from the horoscopes (A–F). The horoscopes may be chosen more than once. In which horoscope is the following mentioned?  47 There's a hidden side to something someone says. 48 Boring people seem to have featured in your life lately. 49 More is less in some situations. 50 Don’t let someone force you to make a hasty decision. 51 Your finances are your own business. 52 Someone special needs your undivided attention. 53 To take advantage of a situation you need to be adaptable. 54 Don’t get carried away by your positive feelings. 55 People tend to be cautious of positive things. 56 It’s time to recharge your batteries. Horoscopes A At times you'll wonder how many major roles you're meant to play in the lives of others. Instead of trying to keep everybody happy, focus on a4 one-to-one relationship that's suffering from neglect. Do whatever it takes to rejuvenate it. A close relationship is about to go through a magical phase, and although you should relax and enjoy it, there will still be tricky topics to tackle. Remember: too many words can weaken even the strongest argument. As a certain situation becomes untenable, it's not your job to make everything perfect for everybody. You could try detaching yourself, as long as those concerned don't start wondering why they're being given the cold shoulder. Be tactful. It may not be until you look back on this week that you realise it was a watershed. That's mostly because you'll be so absorbed by sudden offers and the dilemmas left over from recent events. With things moving so swiftly, you'll have to leave details for later. But you'll soon realise that developments are only the first stage in a series of brilliant ideas and changing situations that lasts until the end of the month. Knowing that, you can afford to aim higher than you would otherwise. Be sure to get to grips with minor problems now - you're in line for one or two wonderful experiences and mustn't be preoccupied with mundane concerns. And certainly don't allow anyone to question how much you're spending on yourself. C Most people are wary of offers that seem too good to be true. However, by now you've probably realised that what came your way last week could change your life. This fantastic trend continues this week, the only problem being that you must respond swiftly, probably before midweek. From that point onwards the mood changes. This might not be much fun but it gives you a chance to investigate what you've got yourself involved in and undertake the first of many sessions of fine-tuning future arrangements. Don't be unnerved by unexpected developments - you'll find strengths you never knew you had. You'll develop an air of optimism. Just remember to take a reality check once in a while. D ] You don't regard yourself as a control freak, or you | didn't, until recently, when numerous decisions were | taken out of your hands. Things haven't been that | bad. You've just been cornered into dealing with tedious people, being dutiful and doing what you dis- | like. However, as you're now discovering, each cleared up a potential obstacle. By the end of the month, not only will the tide turn your way, some of what you have learnt dealing with those loathsome tasks will prove to be unexpectedly handy. If others | tell you something serious, don't freak out, and cer- | tainly don't feel you have to provide instant solutions if you're suddenly offered an ultimatum. You're } sometimes seen as a bit of a pushover - prove that | you're anything but. E Exciting developments earlier this month made you realise that to make the most of what's coming your way, you'll have to be flexible about existing arrangements and future plans. Exhausting as the resulting juggling of plans is, you can't help but be intrigued by what - and who - has come your way. Taking advantage of this requires a serious rethink of elements of your life you'd regarded as set in stone. This takes you in new directions that shake things up. If this seems too much trouble, think of times in the past when you gave similar things a go | and, ultimately, were relieved you did. Try to build into your routine regular intervals during which you can be as light-hearted as you want. You may feel that others are trying to make you work non-stop. They're not. F You'll feel on top of the world at times, but if certain colleagues or associates swear they're on your side, watch out. Some people will try to use words that disguise their true motives, rather than reveal them, don't fall for it. This might be a good time to take a well-earned break and | don't just mean a day or two off work to catch up with the housework. Why not book yourself a last-minute cheap flight to somewhere that you've never been to before. Experience something new and put something back into your creative system instead of giv- | ing out all the time. We all need inspiration every now and again and you are well overdue a refuelling session. You'll bounce back with a strength that you haven't felt for years."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about a woman who looks after orphaned gorillas and monkeys. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) wh ich you think fits best according to the text. A day in the life of a wildlife conservationist At half five, bangl I'm awake. I hear the chimps calling outside. If I'm hand-rearing an infant gorilla or chimpanzee then it's the first thing I see, sprawled across my chest or in the crook of my arm. I splash water on my face, scrape my hair back and get dressed - though putting jeans on with a gorilla holding on to your leg is difficult. I make milk for the baby monkeys and walk to the village where the rest of the staff live. The gorillas in the trees look down at me and beat their chests; that gives me such a buzz in the morning. I was about five when my mum first took me to the zoo, and there was a huge silverback gorilla behind a glass pane, just sitting there, staring. Even as a child, my heart stopped, I was so sad. Flying into Cameroon for the first time, I had this unbelievable feeling: I'm in the same country as wild gorillas. I was overwhelmed. lt felt like coming home. In Cameroon, gorilla and chimpanzee meat sells for anything from £15 a piece. The infants are too small to sell for meat, so, if they survive, the hunters tie them up and drag them through the forest and sell them into the pet trade. In town they get more than £100 each. In Cameroon you see chimpanzees on chains everywhere. In captivity they can live up to 50 years. But infant gorillas usually don't survive seeing their family slaughtered. They die of a broken heart. When I get to the village, I'll have a cup of tea and half a stick of bread and Marmite and join the staff meeting. Around 11, I check with the head keeper that trees aren't overhanging the fences and the electric current is on. it's a constant battle between us and the chimps to keep them in. I look at the chimpanzee groups: how they work together, how they start an argument - they're exactly the same as us. The first time I heard a gorilla laugh I couldn't believe it. Lots of people believe that if you eat gorilla it gives you strength, and the meat is very sweet. But there is a 0.6% difference in DNA between us and them: we're eating our kin. As far as I'm concerned, it's cannibalism. More countries need to take Spain's example and propose human rights for primates. Sometimes I'll come back to my room and have a cup of tea and a plate of rice and beans for lunch. Food is really basic - we haven't the money to buy luxuries. I've eaten just about every type of leaf in this forest, just to show infants how to survive. Often infants come in with frac- I':JJ.iP.J tured legs and arms from gunshot wounds. When the mother's shot, they get the bullet too. W haven't got a vet in camp: we need one. If we're lucky we'll find a hospital willing for us to bring a chimp in to be x-rayed, but sometimes it's days before they are seen. Years ago, locals would hunt gorillas and chimpanzees to feed their family. Now the bushmeat trade has gone commercial. it's huge. The timber companies have opened up the forest, putting roads in areas hunters could never have reached. We're just a plaster over the problem. The only way to stop this slaughter is to stop the people at the top. it's no good telling Cameroonians to stop killing chimpanzees and gorillas when you've got huge western companies raping the whole forest. As the sun goes down at about six, I like to go outside and sit on my chair and think about my family. I miss them. I don't even consider having a relationship: this is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But I'll make that sacrifice: I made a promise when I arrived that I wasn't going to let my babies down. But don't think of them as child substitutes, this is serious conservation. I've had malaria eight or nine times. it's horrendous but you carry on. Our director is a huge support. I never cry in front of the infants. Once I did, and this seven-monthold-gorilla looked into my face and wiped the tears away. You have to be the one to give them support so they get strong. it's humbling that humans have done this to them and they'll turn around and put trust in us again. Normally at half seven I'll grab a packet of crackers and a banana and talk the head keeper through tomorrow's meeting. Sometimes I'm too tired to shower and just fall on my bed. I do the accounts and write my list of things to be done. I'll hear the chimps calling, or one of the monkeys having a shout at something. My eyes just close and that's it. 31 From the opening paragraph we can deduce that the writer A. is slightly nervous of the wild gorillas. B. often finds that baby gorillas or chimpanzees manage to break into her hut. C. tends to keep infant gorillas or chimpanzees as pets. D. has a natural empathy with the animals. 32 Why did the writer feel like she was ‘coming home’ in paragraph two? A. Because it had been such a long time since she had last been there. B. Because she was fulfilling a dream to live in the gorilla’s natural habitat. C. Because she had so many relatives there. D. Because she’d never felt at home anywhere else. 33 According to the writer A. eating gorilla meat can only be justified if the person needs it for medical reasons. B. there is no difference between a gorilla and a human. C. the Spanish are the only nation that have researched primate genetics properly. D. it is as bad to eat gorilla meat as it is to eat human meat. 34 The writer’s diet seems to be A. the same as the diet of the infant gorillas and chimpanzees. B. deliberately modest in order to stay fit and healthy. C. dictated by what limited means are available to her at any time. D. very unhealthy and making her ill. 35 What does the writer mean when she says they are ‘just a plaster over the problem’? A. What they are doing is pointless. B. In the future they will be able to do a lot more than they can now. C. They can’t dramatically improve the situation. D. They are eliminating the worst problems but they could do more. 36 The story of the infant gorilla that wiped away her tears reflects the writer’s A. determination not to get too involved with the animals. B. belief that the animals have human-like feelings. C. desire for revenge on the people who kill the animals. D. depression that has been brought on by doing such a difficult job."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a wildlife book. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. The Big Game of Africa We all know, in an academic sense, that man as a species has existed for a very long time and that we have onl y emerged with our present dominance in the comparatively recent past. The game country of Kenya puts thi s piece of knowledge into context and enables us to experience it at the deep, intuitive level where all knowledge is felt as well as known. When something is learnt in this deep sense the knowledge becomes part of ourselves and enriches our lives. 41)_______ Today this area is a network of roads and tracks and is almost entirely under cultivation. True, it contains the remnants of the Nandi and Kakamega forests but even these are rapidly being turned into charcoal and paper. I have driven over many roads in the area and walked the Nandi Hills without seeing any game. There are a few giraffe left on the high land between Kitale and Eldoret; the remaining antelope are rare and shy; the rhino and the lion have definitely gone. it is the same over vast tract s of Kenya; where seventy years ago there was an abundance of animals, today you will find almost nothing. I was hoping to see elephants.42)_________ A number of cases of elephants aiding an injured comrade have been recorded by hunters and mother elephants have been seen to carry a dead baby around for several days. it has been known for a hunter to track a wounded elephant only to come on the corp se minus the valuable tusks, these hav ing been broken off and smashed by his companions. it is common knowledge that wild elephants coming upon a skeleton of one of their own kind will examine the bones, carry them away, and scatter them far and wide, although they will ignore the remnants of other animals. 43)___________ But now pressure on the elephants' land is increasing. New strains of maize now make it feasible to grow crops in areas where only five years ago there was virtually no human population. The Masai, who until now have grazed their cattle alongside the plains game are beginning to plough their lands for wheat and corn. Other threat s are posed by the increased use of insecticides; the expansion of cities and towns; and most worrying of all, the increase in the human population. Things must change. 44)______________ Above all the pace at which we disturb the natural environment must slow down. Our startling success with the physical sciences has convinced us that we can solve problems quickly by pushing the right buttons. But in nature, problems are not solved quickly, although they can be created overnight. A disturbance of the established order is a wound, quickly inflicted but slow to heal, with the ever-present possibility that the wound may cause a fatal infection. Even a carefully thought -out and well-controlled change is still a form of surgery from which the environment must recover by adjusting its complex mechanisms and balances to the new situation. 45)________ Now, we humans and our greed are out of control all over the world; and in the same sense that a city child must vi sit a farm to find that milk comes from cows, not bottles, so most of us need to visit Africa to find where mankind came from. Even here there is a danger of losing touch with the past. Today the parks and reserves are last-ditch defences for Kenya' s wildlife. The long-term outcome is far from certain, but meanwhile it is our privilege that enough remains for us to glimpse the original glory first hand. 46)_________ Try to stay longer with each group of animals. They will reward you in their time not yours - remember they are making the decisions. There is so much to see one is tempted to rush; more than one hundred species of mammals in Kenya, ninety-five in the Masai Mara Reserve alone. But these animals are not postage stamps or locomotive numbers to be ticked off on a list. Each of them has an individual character and fit s into its own place in thi s complex system. A. The men who started Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries were men of vision. They worked against heavy odds often with inadequate resources. What is now needed is a sense of vision in society as a whole - values which accept that man is a lesser part of a greater whole - an unfashionable idea in our rushing, modern world. We now need measures designed to preserve wildlife for centuries, conceived and administered at the international level. B. Since life began the environment has been adjusting to change; today it is the speed of change which is new and potentially disastrous. A century ago man himself was part of the established order. The elephant hunters did not threaten the survival of the elephant any more than lions. The men of the Ungula tribe - great elephant hunters who used strong bows - had a toughness and knowledge which gave them nobility, in strong contrast to the furtive moral squalor of the international racketeers involved in today's ivory trade. C. There is something inexorable about a herd like this moving across country. No browsing, no pausing to pluck branches or bunches of grass, no moving this way and that. Instead a steady marching, the young ones trotting to keep up. Other animals do not deflect them; they strid~ majestically, as though conscious they are invulnerable, and all give way before them. D. In Kenya's game country, man is not yet the dominant animal and hopefully he never will be. Here, one can come to grips with the fact that for around half a million centuries mammals have been the dominant form of life in Africa and that only in the last of these centuries has man become the dominant mammal. But things are changing. In 1905 an army captain marching from Kitale to Nandi Fort in western Kenya, counted 124 giraffes, 85 waterbucks, 4 rhinos, 62 zebras, 27 ostriches and 4 lions in around 10 miles. E. The slender security of this privilege makes it doubly sad that many visitors bring their own pace with them when they visit Kenya's wildlife. Too much dashing from one Game Park to another does not allow the visitor to attune himself. The use of a vehicle is an advantage in that it can approach the animals without alarming them. However, if it imposes a 21st-century rhythm on your visit to an area which still has the slow pulse of pre-history, you have failed to make the best of your privilege. F. As well as being the biggest and in some ways the most interesting of the animals, elephants are in a sense the most tragic. A century ago they were the masters of the land. They had the run of the continent and generally managed their own affairs. No other large animal has had such a wide range of habitat, from mountain forests through savannah and semi-desert to the coast. G. Uke me, many visitors and scientists find elephants the most interesting animals to observe. There is the constant feeling that the elephants, too, understand, make decisions, have feelings, have friends. Stories of elephants are legion. Modern hunters say elephants know the boundaries of the National Parks and will smartly step inside when hunters are around. If only the poachers knew the rules and stuck to them as carefully as their victims."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a classical music performance. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Riccardo Muti Four critics comment on the concert A At one moment during the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's performance of the Verdi Requiem on Thursday evening, conducted by Riccardo Muti and streamed live from Orchestra Hall in Chicago, viewers could see the rosin glistening on a bow during close-up shots of the violinists. The performance, which had had a relatively low-key build-up, considering it was to be held in honour of the bicentennial of Verdi's birth, was the first concert the orchestra has streamed live on its Website. lt was also viewable on Facebook and other sites and beamed to an outdoor screen at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park. Mr. Muti, widely admired as a Verdi interpreter, made his debut as the orchestra's music director designate in 2009, with the Requiem . He has also impressed with his brilliant, incisive conducting of Verdi operas. B With all the hype and media attention over Thursday 's concert of Verdi 's Requiem, by Riccardo M uti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, on the composer's 200th birthday. one wondered if there was any conceivable way the actual performance could transcend all the relentless build-up. Riccardo Muti is not a musician to fail to deliver on high expectations, especially where music of his compatriot, Giuseppe Verdi , is concerned . The concert, which was streamed live and free on the Internet to an international audience, provided a terrific exemplar to the world of the remarkable partnership of M uti and the Chicago musicians, with this riveting and combustible performance of Verdi 's Requiem mass. Muti 's skill and deep sympathy and understanding of this music, has been a constant throughout his career. He has recorded the Requiem three times, most recently the acclaimed Grammy-winning Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording; that preceded his music directorship in 2009. c Riccardo Muti often has deplored stage directors who run roughshod over the intentions of operatic composers, such as his beloved Giuseppe Verdi. There was no danger of that occurring at Saturday's long-awaited performance of Verdi 's Macbeth , by the maestro and his Chicago Symphony O rchestra, because there wasn't a stage director within miles to distract attention from the music. And the musical glories of Macbeth , one of Verdi 's early masterpieces, came across vividly in this first of four concert performances the music director is conducting at Symphony Centre to honour the composer's bicentennial. Today's foremost Verdi interpreter commanded an impressive international cast of singers, such as any major opera company would envy, most of them younger artists he has worked with in Rome and Salzburg, Austria, and trusts to realise his musical specifications. D Who needs sets or costumes? The much anticipated Chicago Symphony Orchestra concert performance of Verdi's Macbeth took place and , remarkably, exceeded even the high expectations for this event. Magnificently sung and played , and directed by Riccardo Muti, whose lifetime of Verdi experience and scholarship shone through every bar, this riveting Macbeth was one of the musical highlights of the year, and one of the great, memorable Chicago Verdi nights, even in a city with a long and rich history of Italian opera performances. lt was also a testament to the crackling partnership between Riccardo Muti and the orchestra. The hair-trigger responsiveness, whipcrack climaxes, lyric delicacy, and sheer vitality of the playing were technically faultless and , often, astounding. This roiling, powerful Macbeth marks the finest achievement yet from Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, even surpassing the Othelo performances of two years ago.Which reviewer 37. compares this Muti performance with a previous one with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra?  38. implies that the performance exceeded expectations, like reviewer D? 39. disagrees with the other three reviewers, saying that the performance was not as hotly anticipated as might be expected? 40. highlights the technology used to broadcast the performance, like reviewer A?"

    "text": "You are going to read some book reviews about earth exploration. For questions 47 - 56, choose from the reviews (A-F). The reviews may be chosen more than once.In which review is the following mentioned? 47 Someone who left almost no stone unturned around the world. 48 The surprising anonymity of someone. 49 Disappointment that flora and other fauna are not mentioned. 50 A book that is physically difficult to carry around with you. 51 Some details are inaccurate in this book. 52 Information written like an old-fashioned diary. 53 Text that adds something to the images. 54 A collaboration that produced great results. 55 A book that covers all of nature’s seasons. 56 A wide variety of subject matter. Book Reviews on Earth exploration A. A Complete Guide to Life in a Cold Climate by Richard Sale This book is packed with information and deserves to be the ultimate Arctic wildlife guide for a long time to come. It begins well, with an introduction to Arctic geology, climate and habitats, an overview of all the people living and working in the region. The oulk of the book is an extensive field guide to Arctic birds and mammals, with distribution maps and information on confusing species. Its scope is broad and generous, but | have a few niggles. It should really include Arctic plants, fish and invertebrates. This would have doubled the size of the book and made it unwieldy and impractical, but it’s fair to say that the title is misleading. But I’m being picky here, and these minor shortcomings don't detract from the overall value of the book. B. Burton Holmes Travelogues Burton Holmes was the greatest traveller not just of his own time out perhaps of all time. A pretty big claim, but there’s evidence to oack it up. Over a 60-year period, Holmes visited nearly every country on the planet, photographed all he saw, and invented the term ‘travelogue’. His pictures are stunning, both as social history and as art. Holmes photographed everything: the dead on battlefields; the running of bulls in Spain; a mule train in Death Valley. A sequence of Vesuvius erupting in 1906 includes a shot of a woman under an ash-strewn sky that is positively apocalyptic, but Holmes’ work wasn’t restricted to the large canvas - he was as capable of capturing an intimate portrait of a chicken vendor in a Bangkok market as he was revealing the vastness and intricacy of the construction of the Panama Canal. C. No More Beyond by Simon Nasht in Simon Nasht’s brilliant biography of Sir Hubert Wilkins, he says that his subject isn’t like other great explorers, primarily because most of us have never heard of him. He had no lust for fame, instead being driven by a thirst that led him to remote environments and places that cried out for exploration, rather than towards the popular challenges so desired by newspaper editors of the day. Nasht couldn't believe “a man could achieve so much and yet be so little remembered.” In 1917 Wilkins was under the command of veteran polar explorer and photographer Frank Hurley in the Australian Flying Corps. Their mutual interests were vital to the development of aerial photography as an integral part of modern geography. : D. Farmland Wildlife by James McCallum As a refuge for wildlife, British farmland has had a bad press in recent years. Fortunately, the artist's beautiful visual journey through the seasons presented in this book reveals that there is still an abundance of wildlife if you know where to look for it and what to look for. McCallum shuns detailed portraiture in favour of sketches capturing the spirit of his subjects - and hooray for that. If | need precise anatomical detail, | can look at a photograph. But if | want to grasp how a stoat rolls an egg, how a male whitethroat makes his fluttering display-flights or how long-tailed tits work together to build their nests, then | need something more - and McCallum is stunningly good at translating these complex movements and behaviours onto the page. His simple explanatory captions - taken from his field notebook - are a bonus. E. Troubled Waters by Sarah Lazarus Sometimes it seems as though the size of books on whales is led by the size of the subject matter. This, however, is a small, readable book. There are no detailed species accounts and the text is almost entirely devoted to the threats that whales and dolphins face, such as chemical and noise pollution, ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets. A careful read reveals factual errors but, on the whole, these do not affect the thoughtful and concise discussion. It is notoriously difficult to get to the bottom of the whaling issue, and here Lazarus struggles a bit. The International Whaling Commission comes in for a lot of criticism, which would perhaps have been better directed at the three of its members who have chosen not to abide by the spirit of its conservation decisions. F. The High Lowlands by Derek Ratcliffe For some, the south of Scotland is the plainer and less charismatic sibling of the breathtaking Highlands and the rugged West Coast. But it’s every bit as wild as those famed areas, but with a gentler appeal. This book describes an unexpected Eden, a place whose heart pulses to a different beat. This is an epic piece of writing, its subject matter covered in a manner more akin to the journals of a Victorian chronicler than a modern natural history book. Derek Ratcliffe’s recordings of the natural goings-ons in this lonely land spanned 50 years. His intimacy is apparent on every page. Everything is catalogued and described in meticulous detail, and few questions are left unanswered. It’s a great pity that Derek did not live to see his life’s work in print. This is a book for everyone, but it’s a huge volume that you couldn't take with you on holiday unless you've got a pretty hefty rucksack and a strong back."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about girls and their attitude to sport. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. High hurdles for girls My 10-year-old daughter's face was screwed up with determination recently, when she won a gold medal in a long-distance run against 100 others in her age group. She is just as enthusiastic about swimming, gymnastics, athletics and football, and I try hard not to be insulted when people ask, after one or other of her sporting triumphs, 'Where on earth does she get it from?' As I am not particularly overweight nor have an appalling posture I'm not quite sure why it is obvious that I have never been in the slightest bit athletic. Going round a girls' secondary school with my daughter a few weeks ago I was reminded just how dire school sport was for me. Little seems to have changed in the past 25 years - girls in the same old, ill-fitting Airtex tops, horrible kilt-like games skirts and scratchy nylon socks. On our visit, a group of girls hung about the edges of the hockey pitch trying to hide their mottled, freezing legs while the more hearty ones whacked each other with hockey sticks. lt all came back to me; the horrible cheesy smell of the changing rooms and the muddy winter horrors of traditional girls' team games, such as lacrosse, netball and hockey and, worst of all, the cross-country run through the suburban streets of Hendon. What a sight 60 of us must have made thundering down the pavements in our tiny, flapping skirts and mortadella sausage thighs. Small wonder, then, that a study released last month about young people's behaviour in relation to health found that although many girls wanted to be fit and improve their appearance they were too embarrassed to exercise. Helen Haste, a professor of psychology at Bath University and the author of the report, based her research on 687 interviews with 11- to 21-year olds. The most active youngsters did team sports and at least one other form of exercise, but Professor Haste says that fewer than half exercised once a week: 49 percent of girls said they did not feel comfortable exercising in front of other people, while 34 percent didn't like the way they looked in exercise clothes. Haste says, 'The study shows that appearance is important to both sexes, but in particular to girls under 16. We need to take this seriously. Girls feel self-conscious exercising in front of people, while boys don't feel this so much. There seems to be a real tension between teenagers wanting to be fitter to look good and worries about how they look when they are actually exercising,' says Haste. Appearance therefore, is both a driving force to exercise and a reason why girls don't actually want to do it. 'lt is a real waste of an opportunity to have fun and get fit if school sports are making girls feel so ill at ease,' Haste adds. 'We need to think about ways of exercising within the school curriculum which make sure that girls feel comfortable.' When I asked a group of 14-year-old girls at a mixed comprehensive school what they thought of the games on offer at their school, some were fairly enthusiastic. Cathy Dale is good at football, and enjoys its competitive spirit, but thinks it is hard to get sports teachers to give girls the training they need. 'They tend to concentrate on the boys' team even though I think that some of the girls are better than the boys. I think that they expect us to give up pretty soon, so there just isn't the interest. I'm not sure if it's the teachers' fault or the girls' fault.' At the girls' school where we found the unenthusiastic hockey players, the headmistress gave a speech to the parents after the tour of the school and the school grounds. She was unapologetic about the lack of sporting facilities on offer: the message was that as the school was doing well academically it didn't really matter that the girls didn't get much of a chance to succeed at sport. My daughter sneered and whispered that she would never go to a school that didn't take sport seriously, and could we please leave right away? So now the search is on for a secondary school that will nurture her sporty side, although I'm not sure that one exists in my London neighbourhood. 31 How does the writer feel about the way people react to her daughter’s successes? A. She is jealous of her daughter. B. She is put out that they don’t credit her for her daughter’s athleticism. C. She is very proud of her. D. She gets quite defensive with them. 32 How did the visit to the girls’ school make the writer feel? A. Nostalgic for her own schooldays. B. Hopeful that her daughter would like the school. C. It gave her unpleasant memories. D. It made her want to take up a sport again. 33 According to Helen Haste, A. most girls aren’t interested in exercising. B. there aren’t the facilities for girls to get exercise. C. girls tend to tease each other when they are exercising. D. girls are very aware of being watched while they exercise. 34 Haste comes to the conclusion that A. schools will never be able to make girls more comfortable with sport. B. girls will never be able to compete with boys at sport. C. teachers are mainly responsible for making girls feel uncomfortable in sports lessons. D. the schools themselves need to change their attitudes to sport. 35 The headmistress of the school that the writer visited A. regretted that she could not improve the school’s sports facilities. B. wanted the girls to excel academically and athletically. C. didn’t hold sport high in the school’s priorities. D. discouraged the girls from doing any sport at all. 36 The writer’s daughter A. was rude when she spoke to the headmistress. B. felt little respect for what the headmistress said. C. was not impressed with any aspect of the school. D. was intimidated by the headmistress."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Art in bloom. Anyone who's been to Monet’s garden at Giverny, or Derek Jarman’s garden at Dungeness, knows that artists make good gardeners. But do gardens make good art? That is the question Tate Britain poses in its summer exhibition, Art of the Garden. 41) _____. Perhaps it’s because gardening – like fishing and DIY – is generally a private pursuit. It’s not so much something you tend to do with other people. It’s a contemplative activity that induces a state of relaxation, calm and general wellbeing. So, the Tate show may be the first exhibition to examine the relationship between gardens and British art, but where are the major artworks? 42) _____. Instead, Art of the Garden quietly opens a door into the private world of the British garden – in fact, the Secret Garden would have made just as good a title for the show. What’s striking about these images is how little our attitudes towards the garden have changed in the last 200 years – from Samuel Palmer’s A Shoreham Garden of 1829 to David Rayson’s Night Garden of 2003, what we see is a quiet, dreamlike place. 43) _____. I guess it’s not surprising that painters should make fine gardens: colour and composition after all, are at the heart of both painting and gardening. Monet may be the most famous example, but his garden at Giverny was created so long ago that what we see today may bear only a vague relation to the original – gardens being, oddly, far more ephemeral than a painting of the most fleeting atmospheric effect. 44) _____. But the current artistic icon of contemporary gardening is surely the late Derek Jarman, whose tiny garden on the vast pebble beach of Dungeness in Kent has become a modern place of pilgrimage. Jarman’s garden is an inspiring example of how to create a sense of mystery and magic in apparently unpromising surroundings – in this case a bleak shingle bank dominated by a nuclear power station. 45) _____. But tourist attractions aside, it’s the more personal, intimate images of gardens that say so much about the artist. Some painters focus on a section of their garden, maybe a splash of colour in one particular corner. Or the way a single flower can fill a whole canvas making a strong statement about form, colour or detail. Or perhaps a more impressionistic interpretation may be used where shape and form are loose and sketchy but different hues blend for an overall impact. 46) _____. But it is precisely this kind of inference about an artist’s character that is so interesting in a piece of art. Art is after all, a vehicle of communication between two human beings and this too can be said about a garden. A garden is indeed a reflection of the people who own it and that is why ‘garden art’ is such a telling and yet natural phenomenon. A. What's intriguing is that unlike Monet's garden, Jarman's is, arguably, his greatest artistic creation. But then, unlike Giverney, Dungeness remains absolutely uncommercialised. Long may it remain that way! My enduring memory of Giverney is not of its lily ponds but of its electric, revolving toilet seats. Apparently they're popular with Japanese coach parties. B. Which makes perfect sense, when you come to think of it. For aren't gardens, for most of us, an escape from the rational world of work - somewhere for children to play, or for us to play at being children again? The British idea of gardens has an engaging innocence to it. C. The other extreme can be seen in the works of Sir Stanley Spencer. Full of intricate detail, almost like an illustration. Spencer would painstakingly include deli- : cate brickwork and single petals. He must have been a man of order, discipline and precision. You can't imagine him living in a messy house with an untidy garden. D. Given our well-known obsession with gardens and gardening, what's curious is how few, rather than how many depictions of gardens there are in British art. You could, of course, say the same for some of our other national pastimes: how many iconic images of fishing can you think of or DIY and home improvements? E. The curator of the gallery has a strong opinion about this show. He believes that this important work needs to be seen by a wide audience and that it has the power to transform the work of the next generation of British artists. He refuses to give in to the political pressures that have been put on him. F. More recently, lvon Hitchens and Reynolds Stone created semi-wild woodland gardens in Sussex and Dorset, while Patrick Heron made brilliant use of strong colours in both his paintings and his Cornish garden. In Scotland, lan Hamilton Finlay has updated the garden at Little Sparta, juxtaposing texts and landscape in witty and often ironic ways. G. There are some favourite paintings - John Singer Sargeant's Carnation, Lily, Rose and David Inshaw's The Badminton Game - to be sure. However, | don't think anyone would claim either as masterpieces of European art. So the question is, why would a gallery of great prestige such as the Tate have a show that is apparently so low key? Where is the razzmatazz?"

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a theatre performance. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Hamlet Four critics comment on the play A. There can rarely have been such an angry young Dane. In Michael Grandage's fast and filleted production of Hamlet , Jude Law is alight with ire. Thickened with disgust, he becomes almost ugly. He plunges in at full tilt; he jabs with each verb and gesture. At times he becomes a parody of his own vehemence: even 'and' can sound like an insult in his mouth. Yet, against the odds, by the end of the play he has found another register. Law doesn't have the sardonic wit of David Tennant, or the philosophical fluency of Jamie Ballard in Jonathan Miller's recent Tobacco Factory production, but he makes a Hamlet who truly discovers himself. He delivers his anguished 'to be or not to be' in a literal blizzard of uncertainty, speaking amid a flurry of snowflakes, but when he comes to say 'the readiness is all', he is steady: he is not merely parroting a proverb; he makes the words sound like the anchor of the play. B. T hi s w eek we had the great Hamlet bout. Could Jude Law be as good in the role as David Tennant was in last year's Royal Shakespeare Company production? And the news from the West End ringside, so far as I'm concerned, is that it's a squeaker- and that Mr Law is JUSt ahead on points . That said, the Wyndham's production is not a patch on the RSC show in several other· respects. The company has been strangely mi scast. Its Claudius , Ophelia, Laertes, Horatio, Gertrude and ghost are all disappointing. Ron Cook's Polonius is an almost embarrassingly bad stab at the part. He is more like a subservient waiter than a fruity ol d courtier. Still, the Ron Cook fan club seemed to be in attendance at Wednesday's opening night. Polonius's jokes kept getting wild laughs from one section of the audience. At times in this patchy show it is as though director Michael Grandage has not wanted to intervene on the text - or perhaps been too busy to tell his actors what to do. С. Actor Jude Law was recently quoted in a newspaper as saying Hamlet was 'a bit like a great song that's been covered by a load of different singers' . If so, judging by the cheers at the end of his Hamlet debut last night, Law has a hit on his hands, despite a few off-key notes (more notably, in the production, itself). So it was, then , that Law took to t he stage as the Prince of Denmark in the last production in the Donmar's West End season, at Wyndham's Theatre. As the second high-profile star to play the Danish prince in under a year, the comparisons with Doctor Who star, David Tennant, are inevitable. Both played Hamlet at roughly the same age and both are better known for their roles on TV and film , but it's about there the comparisons end. While Tennant was a frenetic Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), switching seamlessly between sanity and feigned madness, Law was filled with ferocious anger, snarling and squaring up during the soliloquies, making more compelling viewing than Tennant, in the end. D. 'Who's there?' The most exciting opening scene in all drama begins thus, but the phrase was lost last night as Jude Law's Hamlet waited in the wings. At the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford last year, it was Or Who's there, as David Tennant performed the role with scintillating astuteness. Jude's sexier, though the hair line's receding- at 37 years old and like Tennant, he's a bit early middle-aged for the eternal student aspect of the role - and his voice is perhaps too huskily monotonous for someone who speaks almost half a play and over three hundred speeches . But we have to give the contest on points, if not quite a knockout, to Tennant. And Michael Grandage's speedy production for the Donmar in the West End season - coming in at just over three hours with some clever cutting and hectic acceleration towards the end - is looking just a bit over repetitive in the Donmar style of black brick and musty lighting design, with portentous sound track to match. 37 Which reviewer commends the performance of Jude Law but finds the rest of the cast lacking? 38 Which reviewer disagrees with the other three reviewers, by finding no flaws in the production? 39 Which reviewer, like reviewer A, believes Law’s Hamlet is not as good as Tennant’s? 40 Which reviewer, like reviewer B, suggests that Law has the edge on Hamlet?"

Fantasy images based on a real environment ____56. Reviews of art events A. Ben Cook and Phil Whiting. Landscape, such a dominant theme in Cornwall, has the chalk and cheese treatment from two artists showing in Penzance this month. At Cornwall Contemporary Gallery Ben Cook · uses abstract vocabulary to make almost entirely conceptual references. His use of found objects and time spent surfing drew him to look at the processes involved in surfboard manufacture. Based on these, his constructions and paintings combine areas of high resist, high speed, water deflecting sheen with those tempered by wax to produce mottled, opaque, non-slip surfaces that smack of stone and solidity. Phil Whiting is a painter. His vigorous use of materials - acrylics in thick impasto inks, charcoal applied with a brush, nife and 'whatever' - recalls a terrain smarting from the brute force of man's misuse of it. This is not the celebrated, picturesque Cornwall we so often see but its dirty, rain-soaked underbelly, a landscape left bereft by voracious ining and haphazard industrial development. B. Shanti Panchal. it is almost thirty years since Shanti Panchal first came from India to study art in London, where he has lived ever since. This retrospective at Chelmsford Museum elucidates 'lis distinctive, radical water-colourist's achievement. Growing up in a Gujarati village, he decorated local houses with images of birds and animals. As a Bombay art student, cave Jaintings and images from Jain temples inspired him, and as a student in Europe, he was drawn to medieval icons. lt is erroneous to say that his work is characterised by poignant nostalgia for India. The paintings are not nostalgic. Rather hey evoke with subtle clarity what it is like to be exiled and dispossessed while at the same time rooted inalienably in nature and the cosmos. Every watercolour is multi-layered, giving a similar surface o Buddhist cave paintings. lt can take days in order to face Nhat is going to happen in a piece. Each picture takes weeks and sometimes months. Recent pictures include por- -raits and even a homage to Frida Kahlo, a painter that Shanti respects immensely. C. lwan Gwyn Parry. Iwan Gwyn Parry's first solo exhibition at Martin Tinney allery in Cardiff is a significant event. Until now the artist has shown mostly in North Wales. Now there is an opportunity to experience, further south, a coherent and powerful assemblage of his latest work. lt is clear the show will be something special. For these remarkable landscapes and seascapes appear to have emerged from deep within his psyche and are a highly imaginative response to a coastal terrain familiar to the artist. There is a strong sense of mysticism, the painting suffused with ethereal vapours and incandescent light; there are restless swathes of deep orange and yellow. The seascapes are haunting and elemenal while the landscapes are more reflective studies in grey, black and white. His oil The Irish Sea, for example is on an awesome scale, its seething waters of churning paint intensely lit by a low sun. Definitely a show not to be missed. D. Art auctions. Of the top three Modern British sales last month, it was Christie's who kicked off the proceedings, but not without controversy. Bury district council, in their wisdom, auctioned a major painting by LS. Lowry so as to cover a £10 million shortfall in their finances. The £1.2 million hammer price, less expenses, will not make all that much difference but the issue has raised the wrath of the Museums Association, who in future, could block lottery and National Arts Collection Fund resources in all aspects of museum and gallery development. Bury may well live to regret their foolhardy action as current and future donators wi ll also not be encouraged to gift works of art which could be sold on a whim. Bonhams followed ten days later with a good but not exceptional sale of which a solid 70% was sold and totalled £2.3 million. lt was then Sotheby's turn to shine which they succeeded in doing, with 80% of lots sold and an impressive total of £7.7 million, though some way behind their arch rival. Records were broken for works by Sir Winston Churchi ll, former British Prime Minister. E. Andrew Grassie. Andrew Grassie's exhibition at Maureen Paley Gallery is aptly entitled 'Installation', since it provides a look backstage at the rituals involved in hanging an exhibition before it officially opens to the public. To achieve this, Grassie devised and followed a pre-determined strategy, namely: \"Install a series of paintings at the gallery depicting last year's previous exhibitions during their installation. Each painting should hang at the very spot from which the image was taken, enabling the viewer to compare views of the space.\" The result is five jewel-like paintings, each one painstakingly copied from a mid-installation photograph taken by Grassie before the opening of the previous year's shows. The paintings are executed with such detail that it is difficult at times to uncover the illusion that these are photographs rather than paintings. F. Story Alexia Goethe. has selected fourteen artists, including six resident in the UK and four from Leipzig, for her show 'Story'. She seeks to demonstrate that whatever technique is used - painting, text, video, photograph or concept - and regardless of style, the artist is telling a story. The tales being told made me come away feeling a sense of recovery. Tales of politics, war, social unrest, personal tragedy, to name just a few, are depicted here. Jin Meng who now resides in Europe, produces exquisitely framed views from the present onto China's past. Political statues, glimpsed from a deserted bedroom, evoke the vast changes sweeping his birthplace. Jean Tinguely's kinetic assemblages illustrate how the mechanical is subverted into the amusing and the desirable. This is an eclectic mix of treasures that can't fail to shock, amuse and move."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about encouraging teenagers to keep fit. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. Get them going! Welcome to the world of the 21st century teenager - where DVDs and computer games rule and trainers are something you wear to look cool rather than run in. As a result, at a time when they should be at their peak fitness, the UK's teenagers are lagging badly behind. A national survey recently found that many 16- to 20-yearolds had less aerobic capacity and muscle strength than healthy 60-year-olds. And not surprisingly this is giving cause for concern. Roger Draper, chief executive of Sport England, agrees. 'If they want to give themselves a head start in staying healthy for life, teenagers need to get into the exercise habit now', he says. 'We want to see more teenagers channel ling their natural energy into exercise in any shape or form.' Many parents think that encouraging teenagers into sport is something schools should take responsibility for but Andrew Findley, a former PE teacher, points out that schools can only go so far. 'The majority of pupils only get two hours of PE a week so although it's better than nothing there's only so much teachers can do - parents have a major role to play too', he says. 'lt always amazed me how many pupils would come with a note from home excusing them from PE without good reason. A lot of teenagers also feel it's not cool to do well at school and that goes for PE as much as other subjects.' A recent survey of 11- to 14-year -olds revealed that sport is becoming a less popular way of spending leisure time while the number of chi ldren in that age range who say they love sport has dropped by 10 percent compared to previous years. Roger Draper puts this down to the number of other pursuits competing for teenagers' leisure hours, from playing on the computer to going out clubbing. 'That's why we're looking to support sports such as skateboarding and other street sports, which young people are increasingly interested in. We cannot just promote the old traditional sports of football, hockey and cricket - many teenagers still want to play these but many others don't and we need to broaden sport's appeal.' Membership of sports clubs drops significantly in teenage years; 71 percent of 7- to 10-year -olds belong to a club compared to 43 percent of 15- to 19-yearolds. The danger is that those who have dropped out may not take up another activity to keep them fit and will enter adulthood with a sedentary lifestyle. While for teenagers who wouldn't even dream of joining a sports club in the first place, it's particularly important that they find alternative exercise they enjoy - or at least do regularly. it's great if teenagers show an interest in competitive sport but if they don't, it's essential to realise that exercise and the health benefits it brings are more important than becoming brilliantly skilled in a particular discipline. it's all very well talking about the benefits of exercising but when you're faced with telling a sulky 16-year-old you're not driving them down the road because the walk will do them good, it's another matter. So is it really worth the effort? Bearing in mind the way a teenager's mind works can help parents to strike a balance between encouraging a more active lifestyle and what will be viewed as nagging. Dr Dawn Skelton points out that most teenagers find it hard to imagine themselves getting older and live for today not tomorrow, so the importance of keeping fit for the future may be lost on them. 'Parents need to focus on how a healthier lifestyle can help them now', she says. 'If they are studying for exams for instance, research shows that exercise can boost their concentration levels. Girls might be inspired by the fact that exercise can improve their looks in terms of their skin as well as their figures and teenage boys might like the idea of building up their muscle mass. Sport can also be useful social contact through which they can form relationships that last a lifetime.' And of course, setting a good example helps too. it's no good telling your child to get up and be active if you are slouching in front of the TV. Family trips to the swimming pool, bowling alley or nearest country park will help you all to stay active - with family harmony as an extra bonus. If they try something they aren't keen on, encourage them to give it a good go but if they are sti ll adamant it's not for them try and find an alternative rather than insisting they carry on or just give up. Many clubs provide taster sessions so you don't have to shell out for a whole course and risk your teenager dropping out after a few tries. Maybe the most important thing is to remember that whatever they choose to do, it can be challenging but it should be fun. That way they are more likely to stick at it and reap the rewards of a healthier lifestyle. 31 What is suggested in the opening paragraph? A. Teenagers don’t want to get their clothes dirty. B. Teenagers are more interested in fashion than health. C. Older people are much healthier than they used to be. D. Teenagers won’t take exercise if older people are around. 32 According to Andrew Findley A. children write false notes to excuse them from PE at school. B. parents need to be skillful at the sports that children like. C. parents are unhappy with the sports facilities in schools. D. parents sometimes aggravate the situation. 33 Roger Draper believes that the situation could be improved by A. offering a wider choice of activities. B. scrapping all traditional sports. C. banning all team sports in schools. D. introducing extreme sports to inspire teenagers. 34 One of the problems with pushing a teenager to be more active is they may A. not appreciate the wider benefits of exercise. B. become too tired to do their schoolwork. C. insist on their parents taking up a sport too. D. resent the fact that they can’t do certain sports with their friends. 35 In order to inspire a teenager, you A. should tell them about the sports you used to play when you were young. B. should stress how lucky they are to have good sports facilities. C. ought to practise what you preach. D. should ban them from watching TV in the evening. 36 When a teenager is willing to try something new, parents A. should never pay money upfront for them to take part in a sport. B. shouldn’t force the issue if things don’t turn out as expected. C. shouldn’t risk them joining a club unless it has been recommended. D. should be careful to avoid any sports that are expensive."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article about following your little passions in life. Six paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–G the one which fits each gap (41–46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. 'One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested', the author E. M. Forster once said. Some people's passion may be about winning Olympic gold, discovering a cure for cancer or sailing across the Atlantic single-handed, but passion doesn’t always have to involve amazing, earth-shattering feats or superhuman efforts. 41)_____ In 1959 Dr Robert White, an American personality psychologist, introduced the term 'effectance motivation', or the urge we all have to engage with our environment to make our influence felt, and to master tasks in a competent fashion. You can see this if you watch children when they’re transfixed with mastering a game or task. Time flies and they have no sense of anything going on outside their ‘concentration zone’: that's a slice of pure passion and emotion in action! 42)_____ Sometimes passion can be ignited by things we don’t want to happen as much as by those we do. Almost every campaign for public good, from the abolition of slavery through to women's right to vote and Live Aid for Africa, started with a spark of passionate rage that grew to a far-reaching flame. The last of these examples reflecting the growing trend for celebrities fighting for a good cause. 43)_____ The truth is that passion can ebb and flow and when we're tired, depressed or despondent it tends to be the first thing to disappear. But according to Christine Dunkley, a psychological therapist, we have a lot of control. 44)_____ This is important because being passionate may help us live longer. A study by Professor Thomas Glass examined the impact of activities we might feel passionate about on longevity. The findings were dramatic. 'Social engagement was stronger than things like blood pressure, cholesterol, or other measures of health.' So do something for your health. Ask yourself what you feel strongly about. What would you like to do, change, make, become? 45)_____ Every one of us has an interest in something, but it often gets sidelined with the demands of daily life. We may come to view it as an indulgence, or worry we will be judged for it, particularly if the thing we love isn't something we're particularly good at. But passion doesn't necessarily mean being great at something. And what if you don’t know where your passion lies? 46)_____ Whatever you settle on, the main thing is to find something. Reawaken your passionate side and appreciate the passion in others. You’ll find life becomes more fulfilling and colourful. We may not be able to live every minute of every day passionately – that would probably be exhausting! But with a bit of thought and imagination, passion is something we can enjoy experiencing at least a little of every day. A. In fact, if you're not feeling passionate, there is evidence that acting as if you are can help! 'If you jump, throw a fist in the air and shout \"Yes!\", a feedback loop in your brain will interpret this behaviour as passionate and you'll get a surge of adrenaline,' she explains. 'People who are under-emotive can increase their pleasurable hormonal responses by behaving enthusiastically.' B. If you are not sure exactly what you want to explore, try tasters in subjects you're interested in first. Get a book about it, talk to someone who's done it, find a one-day workshop. Perhaps your passion could simply be trying new things? C. Passion can be as simple as teaching children to play football or getting up early in the morning to photograph a beautiful sunrise. it's not about doing something because you think you should or because it will make you money - it's about doing something you love as well as you can, purely for the love of it. D. Whether this particular example of passion is misplaced or not is another matter. it's about people standing up for something they really believed in. lt was their 'cause', even though few people agreed with their ideals. They were prepared to fight for what they wanted and risked everything in the process. E. it's fairly easy to identify passionate people in the public eye - most people at the top of their profession have needed a hefty amount to get them there. But there's a difference between pure passion and cold, calculating ruthlessness. True passion usually involves a positive gain directed outside ourselves - towards other people or nature. But what if you're struggling to muster enthusiasm for daily life, let alone to feel passionate about anything? F. Consider what you are doing when time seems to fly. What did you love as a child or teenager? Consider anything you've felt 'naturally' drawn towards. What activity never seems like work and always boosts your energy? G. According to international coach Anthony Robbins we each need to find the emotional force that drives us. 'The most important decision we make in life', says Robbins, 'is to focus on something that will get us inspired, excited, something that will move us, something that will ignite a spark.'"

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a new restaurant. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D . The reviews may be chosen more than once. Union Street Cafe Four critics comment on the restaurant A. If any among you still doubt that David Beckham is an exceedingly smart cookie, members of the jury, allow me to submit the clinching evidence. A few weeks ago, the Daily Mirror recently reported, he withdrew as an investor in his chum Gordon Ramsay's Union Street Cafe, which opened in Southwark on Monday. The Mirror did not explain why, revealing only that the two men 'wanted different things'. We could speculate for hours about what that means, but let me posit this theory: Beckham wanted a really good restaurant and Ramsay wanted something else. This is not to suggest he wanted a really bad restaurant. Eccentric as his psycho shtick may make him appear, he is not clinically insane, and this newbie, his I Oth in Britain, is far from atrocious. lt would be more endearing, or at least more memorable, if it were. What makes it so irksome is the so-what-ishness of this rather brand new restaurant. B. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to close my eyes, stick my fingers in my ears and pretend I don't know that this big, new, shiny restaurant in Southwark has anything to do with Gordon Ramsay. Otherwise, it's impossible to approach without being blind-sided by the baggage trailed in his wake. He's the tallest of poppies, our Gordon; everybody lining up to give him a trampling. So let's make believe that Union Street Cafe is brought to us by nice, anonymous people intent on giving us fine food and a good time. You in? This is Big Sweary's first opening without his eminence grise pa-in-law, with whom he fell out in spectacular, Greek tragedian fashion. Sorry, I'll try again. it's all cheery bustle in this high-windowed and handsome room, more New York than London, in its studied mix of haute-industrial and luxury: ducting and concrete, framing well-spaced tables and designer leather chairs. The open kitchen is set on high, pulpit-style; inside is chef Davide Degiovanni, formerly of the Four Seasons. it's a telling piece of recruitment: despite the warehouse disguise, this is not about the grunge. С. Union Street Cafe is not a cafe and isn't strictly in Union Street (see address below) but it's certainly the most talked-about and 'in' new restaurant for the autumn. This, you'll doubtless know, is because it was rumoured that its owner, Gordon Ramsay, the former footballer who once had a trial with Rangers, was going into partnership with David Beckham, the wel lknown foodie. Why this macho convergence would have made for an ideal restaurant, is hard to fathom. Have we got a picture in our heads of Victoria in a lace pinny, sulkily announcing the daily specials? No? Just me, then . But it doesn't matter now, because Beckham chose not to invest any dosh. So the USC is just a new Gordon Ramsay joint, in a funny part of town. Great Suffolk Street isn't hopelessly grotty, just a bit down-at-heel. lt, and Union Street which it bisects, are in the heart of Southwark, the raffish heart of Olde South London that's now so trendy, bounded by Tate Modern, Borough Market, Guy's Hospital and the London Dungeon. I think it appealed to Gordon because it's London's version of Brooklyn; edgy, but without the West End's gleam and swagger. And there's a famous Union Street in Brooklyn. D. David Beckham pulled out at the last minute, but that hasn't stopped a rush for tables at Gordon Ramsay's new venture; and the fact that Union Street Cafe is doing brisk trade, proves that Ramsay himself retains impressive pulling power. With its casual urban setting and emphasis on Italian cooking, this venue marks a welcome departure for the megastar chef, who has drafted in Davide Degiovanni to head up the kitchen . Expect small portions of accomplished, ingredients-led dishes, ranging from intensely flavoured tagliolini with rabbit and provolone, or lamb cutlets with baked fennel and onion, to Amaretto and chocolate budino, a deliriously rich, custardy dolce. Switched-on young staff in casual garb are a good fit for the restaurant's warehouse-chic theme and there are cocktai ls aplenty in the basement bar. 'I absolutely loved the whole package,' said one fan. Which reviewer: makes inferences to New York in their review when discussing the restaurant’s décor, like reviewer B? 37___ like reviewer A, suggests that the public might lack sympathy with Ramsay’s public persona? 38___ disagrees with the other three reviewers, believing Ramsay’s new restaurant to be not particularly fashionable? 39___ like reviewer C, believes that having a famous owner, has helped the popularity of the restaurant? 40___"

Health advice magazine A There are now five times as many cases of food poison- .. 1ng as there were 20 years ago. it's partly down to the act that we eat out more often. Consider that one in •hree men and one in five women admit that they don't Nash their hands after going to the toilet or before preparing food; it's enough to put you off popping out for a quick bite on a Friday night. And before you reach for Jne of those mints sitting on the counter by the till, think 'YJW many non-hand-washers have dipped their fingers into :hat bowl. But the problem isn't restricted to grubby eateries. More than half of food poisoning infections are ntracted in the home. This may be because people are : ating more pre-prepared food and shopping less often, so ;ood is stored for longer. But most food poisoning is pre- 'entable if you know what you're doing. 8 ext time you have a headache, don't automatically reach ;or the painkillers. Using them too often could be more jangerous than you think. For a vulnerable minority, the ·oute to addiction can be alarmingly fast. it's thought :hat overusing painkillers leads to changes in the way the Jfain handles pain signals, so it becomes oversensitive to s imuli that wouldn't normally cause pain. As the pain :hreshold lowers, people seek out stronger medication ::nd increase the dosage and soon they are hooked. Somewhere along the line we have become blase about e dangers of these medicines which are available in Jetrol stations, news agents and supermarkets. People 1ust not assume that over the counter drugs are safe Jecause clearly this is not the case. C. - he basic premise of detox is that we need to clear the toxic waste from our bodies every so often in order to stay healthy. lt sounds a reasonable idea, but nutrition experts are quick to point out that there's no evidence to support it. Detoxing is a concept that underestimates the abilities of our liver and kidneys. Any toxins that do get absorbed are very efficiently dealt with and secreted by our bodies. The concept of detox diets is irrational and unscientific. Those promoting detox diets often claim that in order to detoxify, we should avoid foods such as wheat and dairy products. The reality is that these foods pro- ;ide us with important nutrients, and it is unnecessary and potentially harmful to exclude them from the diet. D. There is a lot of publicity about the dangers of having 'high cholesterol' at the moment - mainly coming from companies that make special foods that claim to lower it for you. lt is a widespread problem though: according to the British Heart Foundation around two thirds of British people have a blood cholesterol level above the suggested healthy target figure. And as there are no symptoms until it causes disease, many people with high cholesterol may not be aware that they have it. However we need some cholesterol because the body wouldn't function without it! lt is a key part of cell membranes and it is also found in bile, which is important for digestion and absorption of fat. E. Just like a real-time personal trainer (PT), an online coach discusses personal goals, tailors exercise schedules and offers advice to clients of all abilities. Instead of face-toface guidance, however, the virtual trainer gives feedback via emails and texts - perfect for the self-concious exerciser! While critics say that it is impossible to effectively train clients without meeting them, online coaches offer a valuable compromise when it comes to training. First they are a cost-effective alternative. Second, they represent a more flexible option, especially if your work takes up much of your time or makes it difficult for you to commit to regular sessions. And just because your coach is in cyberspace, it doesn't mean he won't be keeping tabs on you. The mere thought of the next email should have you racing to put on your sports kit. F. Most of us are unclear as to where social drinking stops and alcohol dependency starts. A heavy-drinking student is fairly normal, but a 40-year-old party animal? A sozzled 60-year-old? At what point do the questions demand a serious answer? Recommendations from the government are that men should consume no more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women only two to three units. Of course, committed social drinkers of all ages often ignore units, taking comfort from the fact that they are not reaching for the bottle before lunchtime, and their friends are drinking as much as they are so it must be alright. But you can even test yourself online by looking at Alcohol Concern's website to determine if alarm bells should be ringing. Most people can reduce their alcohol consumption without professional help but it's not just about cutting down, it's about editing your life to remove the reasons you are drinking too much."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about exam technology. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. The Future of Exams Like it or not, technology is already an established part of the exam process and the only argument still to be fought at this year's e-assessment conference and exhibition, taking place in London this week, is just how much further in that direction we should go. At one end, little has changed. Students still, by and large, take exams in much the same way as they always have. They walk into a room full of desks with an invigilator on hand to tell them when to start and stop and to make sure no one is texting anyone else, and everyone is ticking the right boxes, or writing out the answer in longhand if required. it's once the ink has dried that the real change in the system kicks in. Instead of divvying up the scripts between the thousands of markers, they are now scanned into a central computer and the markers then access them online. The benefits are obvious. it's quicker, cheaper and more efficient. The really dull components, such as multiple choice or simple questions such as \"name four things that contribute to global warming\", can be marked automatically or by less experienced markers, whereas questions requiring a more nuanced, longer answer can be left to the old hands. Your best markers don't have to be wasted on the straightforward stuff. Students can also benefit. \"Markers can now give much more precise feedback\", says Kathleen T attersall, who chairs the Institute of Educational Assessors. \"We can tell someone almost exactly what he or she needs to do to improve a grade because we can show them what they got right and wrong. This is particularly useful for anyone looking to resit a January exam in the summer, because teachers can tailor individual revision plans for all their students.\" For all its advantages, no one reckons that this assessment model is the finished article. \"There are difficulties that need to be ironed out\", says Martin Walker, a former English teacher and a principal examiner for one of the main boards. \"Because markers are now often only given a few questions from each paper, it's hard to get an accurate feel of exactly what a student does and doesn't know. When you had an entire exam script in front of you, you could build up a picture of the candidate's range of knowledge, so when there was room for doubt in an answer you could make a judgement call based on previous responses. it's much harder to do that now.\" \"There are also limits to what you can easily read on screen\", he adds. \"In my experience, most examiners end up printing out the long essays and working from a hard copy, which is both time-consuming and slightly self-defeating.\" The danger, as Tattersall concedes, is that schools end up teaching only what technology is capable of assessing. \"Rather, we have to look at how IT is used in the classroom to improve teaching and learning and base our exams on that model\", she says. lt is certain that we are only halfway through the electronic revolution. In the coming years, more and more exams will be completed - as well as marked - online, and the government and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority will have to think hard about ways of maintaining standards. By far the easiest form of online testing to implement is multiple choice. A student can take the test online and it can be automatically marked instantaneously; this system is almost foolproof. The downside is that most people associate multiple choice with dumbing down, on the grounds that anything that can be reduced to a yes or no, right or wrong answer is bound to be over-simplified. \"Not true\", says Stevie Pattison-Dick, head of communications for Edexcel. \"Some multiple-choice exams may be quite straightforward, but if they are, they only reflect the level of knowledge a student is expected to attain. There's nothing inherently simple about multiple choice. We've become very sophisticated in our question setting and are able to cross-reference the answers, so an examiner can now tell whether someone just got lucky by ticking the right box or actually understood the process on which he or she was being assessed.\" One of the final exams a medical student has to pass before qualifying as a doctor is multiple choice, so this method of assessment has to be extremely rigorous. 31 The writer believes that A. nothing of significance has changed in the exam system. B. a revolution in exam taking may soon be initiated. C. many students cheat by using their mobile phones. D. technology doesn’t greatly affect students when they sit exams. 32 What does the writer mean by ‘old hands’ in paragraph 3?

There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. \"Robots to the rescue\". In the war on terror, University of South Florida engineering Professor Robin Murphy finds herself a pioneer on the front line with a new kind of soldier: the search-and-rescue robot. Strewn about are piles of broken concrete blocks and pipes, metal and dirt. Amid the rubble, a small black object looking like some futuristic toy tank rolls into view. It surveys the damage, edges forward, climbs over a mound of debris, then stops. Suddenly, the rubber treads shift from horizontal to vertical, raising the lens into a better vantage point to transmit images. The robot has done its job. 41)____________ She looks like an emergency worker ready for action: work boots, navy-blue trousers, white hardhat over her short brown hair. One moment, she's answering questions from scientists. The next, she's racing to another robot demonstration, always keeping the program moving. In a larger sense, that's what Murphy does best – she keeps the relatively new field of robotics and rescue moving forward. January’s \"Discover\" magazine honoured Murphy in its \"Top 100 Science Stories of 2002\" edition. 42)____________ Murphy, at 46, is in demand these days. When she's not teaching at USF, she's travelling the country giving presentations, serving as a co-chair on various committees, or coordinating with the Department of Defence. Murphy is hardly the stiff scientist one might expect from a robotologist. She is disarmingly casual in conversation. Yet she is also intense, pushing herself and the people around her. What separates Murphy from her colleagues is that many of them don't get out into the field. But that's where she thrives, and where she gets the knowledge to make her robots successful. 43)____________ \"Imagine the scenario where something green is hanging over the city and you don't know what it is and or where it’s coming from,\" she says. \"These guys can roll in, and throw a robot off the back of a truck to carry all the gas meters and detectors. Then, the rescuers are able to figure out what safety precautions to take. The robots will help the rescuers make the right decisions.\" 44)____________ \"Later, her work began to gain attention when she was a professor at the Colorado School of Mines, where she taught before going to USF six years ago. There, her ideas impressed Rita Virginia Rodriguez of the National Science Foundation. Rodriguez began funding Murphy’s work in Colorado, and continues to do so at USF. \"Robin is one of the most important people in this movement,\" says Rodriguez. \"She’s one of the engineers who is very good, very forward-thinking. What we’ve seen today is the first workshop of its kind and it is all her initiative.\" 45)____________ The birth of robot-assisted search and rescue began with one of the nation’s worst disasters: the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. One of Murphy’s graduate students, was appalled at the large, clumsy robots that sat unused in a car park. Bitton soon helped create a Defence Department programme to build small, mobile robots for battlefield applications. At the same time, Murphy and her students began focusing on software: how to control robots, how to integrate them with a computer. When 9/11 occurred, Murphy was there immediately. Yet her team was not accepted right away. 46)____________ The work never ends. Murphy says, \"I just want to be of use. Look at what the guys in fire and rescue service have to do. The technology is there to help them, and it’s up to scientists to provide the right technology to fit to the right people at the right time.\". A. Her father was a mechanical engineer, so it was in the family. As a child she immersed herself in science fiction: \"I never really identified with the heroes\" she says. \"I always thought the scientists who built things for these guys were far more interesting.\" She earned her Master's degree in computer science at Georgia Tech., won a fellowship and worked for a professor with expertise in artificial intelligence and within two months, she was on her way to her Ph.D. B. At first, the USF contingent had trouble getting through the police lines. \"The fire and rescue teams were a bit suspicious, because when they think of robots, they think of big explosive ordnance devices,\" she says. But eventually they were able to get close enough to help, and the smaller robots proved remarkably effective. Murphy has moved at an intense pace ever since, working to become even more effective in the event of another terrorist attack. C. Applause fills the breezy morning air. Some 50 scientists are impressed by the brief demonstration of the VGTV, Variable Geometry Tracked Vehicle. They have come from universities, industry, the military and countries as far away as Japan, Sweden, Italy and England. They have left their classrooms, computers and academic theory behind to get their hands a little dirty: to see an array of search-and-rescue robots perform in simulated conditions. And they are all here because. of Professor Robin Murphy. D. Murphy and her students don't actually build the robots. What they do, in essence, is take models made by companies and create the software programmes to adapt them to search and rescue. The little VGTV that performed so effectively in the rubble of the twin towers collapse had been built to explore air-conditioning ducts. They gave it a new brain and figured out ways to transport it in a backpack and deploy it at a moment's notice. E. However, there are still many problems with the whole project. Funding is the main one. Murphy often struggles to gain funding from the usual channels due to her lack of an academic background which tends to put off a lot of potential sponsors. They seem to ignore the fact that her achievements have more than made up for any official qualifications that she may be missing. lt remains to be seen if this will, in the end, be the cause of the demise of her work. F. The workshop is full of innovations. Nearby, a team from the University of Minnesota displays its robot named Scout - a tiny tube with two wheels and an antenna. One of the inventors picks Scout up and tosses it on the pavement. No problem. lt keeps rolling. \"People are starting to see what robots can do\", Murphy says. \"One thing we're trying to do is help rescue workers learn what's possible.\" G. She was featured for her advances with rescue robots, in particular the work she and several graduate students performed at the World Trade Centre. With a cadre of robots packed in the back of her husband's van, they arrived on September 12 2001 and stayed for eleven days. A handful of the small VGTV robots squeezed deep into the collapse, helped identify five victims, and transmitted many detailed videos and photos. \"But\", she says, \"we weren't in Discover just because we were at the World Trade Centre. it's what we've done since.\" "

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a rock concert. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Radiohead Four critics comment on a live show A. \"IT'S RADIOHEAD NIGHT!\" shouts the menu poster outside the bar'n'grill just inside the 02 Arena's doors. At first you just roll your eyes at the crater-sized disconnect between knee-jerk corporate food marketing and the ethos of the band whose name is being taken in vain , in block caps. Even when Radiohead were a conventional outfit, singing grunge-pop ditties such as Creep, their image was that of haughty refuseniks, not shirtless Lotharios lairily gnawing buffalo wings. Thom Yorke had publicly aligned his band with the aesthetically disaffected, the creeps and the weirdos. Twenty years on, Radiohead remain one of the biggest bands in the world, one uncommonly in control of their own destiny. They are label-less and immune to corporate pressure. The last laugh is very much theirs. There is no little heroism in the fact that the Oxfordshire five-piece can come to giant sheds like these and sell them out with their jazz-tinged electronic rock, sung in falsetto by a nervy mendicant type sporting a beard and a top-knot. B. it's a decade and a half since OK Computer catapulted Radiohead to global superstardom. They've now been one of the biggest bands in the world for so long that it's easy to forget how curious and unique their situation is: in a world where rock and pop is not much given to overestimating its audience, here is a band whose music long ago abandoned any pretensions to commerciality capable of filling out the kind of venues where Rihanna or Coldplay normally ply their trade. Anyone requiring a reminder of the incongruity of Radiohead's position, needs only to step inside the 02 arena. Jauntily yellow-jacketed stewards are flogging soft toys, emblazoned with the words VAMPIRES SUCK MY BLOOD in gothic script. In one of the 02's numerous chain restaurants, menus announce that it's Radiohead Night; quite how the dread-filled, agitated sound found on their last album, King Of Limbs, squares with bourbon-glazed baby back ribs and the Cajun spiced chicken sandwich, remains open to question, but you can't blame them for trying. С. \"Hello. My name's Lady Gaga.\" Thom Yorke's introduction to Radiohead's first British audience in four years, was happily and tellingly unpredictable. Saturday's sell-out show at 02 Arena, one of only three UK dates following a more substantial swing across the US, served as delayed support for another creative left turn in the form of 20 I l's The King of Limbs. That album dispensed with the more conventional textures of its predecessor, In Rainbows. In came a new fascination with samples and programming, leading to a hyper-physical kind of electronica that Yorke likened to the wildness of nature. He certainly had a point. There's a tendency to over-rationalise the music of Radiohead, but this gig proved that the Oxford five-piece band are more than capable of delivering on a gut level. Separator, for example, was an impressionistic space ballad given real heft by punishing dance beats, while the riot of grooves that shunted Feral out into drill'n'bass territory, was symptomatic of their entire approach. D. By rights, Radiohead should have been here to relive the good old days. 1998 was the height of the British art-rock outfit's third album, OK Computer, making them a very big deal indeed. Their heyday alas is now long gone. However, that magnum opus, OK Computer, still casts a long and glorious shadow over their career and in fan memories -as was witnessed to the response to two of its tracks, Airbag, up early, and the symphonic Paranoid Android, last song in the first encore, by the sold-out 02 arena crowd. But this wasn't a greatest hits show. lt wasn't even pushing their recent offering, 20 I l's King of Limbs, too much, with maybe half a dozen tracks in the two-hour twoencore show. Which might have left many present a bit non-plussed at no dusting off of breakthrough hit Creep, or anything off second big-chorus anthemic album The Bends. WHICH REVIEWER: uses the food vendors at the O2 arena, like reviewer A, to illustrate a point about the band’s attitude towards money? 37____., conveys the idea that people may over-analyse the music of Radiohead? 38____., disagrees with the other three reviewers, in believing that Radiohead have had their day? 39____., like reviewer A, suggests that Radiohead avoid being a mainstream pop band? 40____"

IN WHICH REVIEW IS THE FOLLOWING MENTIONED? 47 It is easily forgotten once it has been read.________ 48. People join together to fight a common enemy.________ 49. A bad start but a good ending.________ 50. Anti-government rebels are used as guinea pigs.________ 51. A human transmitter.________ 52. A predictable but enjoyable ending.________ 53. The story of someone growing up.________ 54. This book has been written perfectly for its target reader.________ 55. Someone keeps remembering things in his/her past.________. 56 Two eras existing at the same time.________. A. Gifts - Ursula Le Guin. Gifts is a coming-of-age story, intended, at a guess, as a book for young teenagers, and as such has to be written with scrupulous care. In this respect it is exemplary. Tightly-plotted, there isn't a word out of place. Quintessential Le Guin, in fact. This book is set on a world which might be Earth but could just as easily not be, in what is almost a default fantasy land, with a scrape-an-agricultural-living uplands, the main narrative. The book is not quite a Wizard of Earthsea but it gets very close and as is usual with Le Guin's work, Gifts, despite its quota of disputes, conflict and death, is a life-affirming experience, well worth reading by adults of all ages. B. Soul Purpose - Nick Marsh. It shouldn't happen to a vet. Alan Reece, human wreck, is called out one night in late December to tend to a pregnant cow, but the calf is born transparent. This is but the first in a global outbreak of transparent births, and Alan finds himself at the centre of the oncoming apocalypse. Actually this book reminds me not a little of that book about exploding sheep from a few years ago. It's not a very bad book, it's just not a brilliant book either. The prologue is terrible; the epilogue is surprisingly good; in between it averages out. This isn't the first metaphysical comedy adventure book I've read this year, so possibly it's arrived at the right time to take advantage of a trend of some sort. However, \"memorable\" and \"original\" are two words I can't, in all sincerity, use to describe it. C. The Space Eater - D. Langford. Wormhole travel is possible but only up to a diameter of 1.9 cm. Through one such spyhole, the government discovers that a distant colony world is developing weaponry based on Anomalous Physics which could endanger whole star systems. Send in the marines! Oh no, wait, they don't make 19 cm tall Marines. Enter Ken Jacklin, one of a team of soldiers trained to charge headlong into death and be grown back in regeneration tanks, even when blown to a pulp. Accompanying him is Rossa Corman, a woman who can send messages coded in pain back to Earth by jabbing herself in the arm. The premise that someone can be remade - body and mind - from jam hours after their death is a little hard to swallow, but in general it's very hard to fault this novel. The characters are rounded and engaging, the story is lively and well told with intrigue aplenty, and the science, however out there it may be, is explained in accessible and thought-provoking terms. A very rewarding read. D. Babylon - Richard Calder. Babylon has a lush feel to it. Calder writes erudite and richly detailed prose which situates the characters first in the Victorian London of Jack the Ripper and later in the crumbling metropolis of a modern Babylon existing in a parallel dimension. The book is strong on atmosphere and there are some marvellously melodramatic set pieces in which major plot shifts are played out. I get the impression that Calder knows his material and wants the reader to be able to visualise his world clearly but this enthusiasm for detail is also one of the novel's drawbacks. The pages are cluttered with facts and at one point I began to feel some sympathy with the character who shouts out that she doesn't know anything. Whilst the book jacket promises blood and gore and there are intimations of ravishment scattered throughout the first part of the novel, the second and third parts deliver little of either and the melodramatic quality of the set pieces seems increasingly at odds with the cerebral working out of the novel's conclusion. E. Against Gravity - Gary Gibson. In 2088, following a terrorist nuclear strike on Los Angeles, America’s political dissidents are rounded up and sent to the Maze, a top secret research facility, to provide experimental hosts for military nanotech. This is a densely packed Science Fiction thriller, and for all the twists and action the pace felt quite sedate to me. I think it might be all the flashbacks – Gallon is the only viewpoint character, and his story is intercut with lengthy scenes of his time in the Maze, which he has escaped from. This material is well depicted, particularly the gruesome failed experiments and the survival-of-the-fittest tests. Against Gravity is a good futuristic action novel, but the tagline “Live long enough and this could be your future” on the front cover tells me Gibson intends this novel first and foremost as a comment on the world we live in today. F. The New World Order - B. Jeapes. In Ben Jeapes' latest novel invaders arrive on Earth to find the locals already at war; with their superior technology, the invaders hammer both sides indiscriminately but end up uniting the humans against them. Except that these invaders not only come armed with machine guns and airships but also with witchcraft, their special wise cadre tapping the Earth's ley energy. This is a lively and intelligent novel from Ben Jeapes. A section at the end caps the story with historical notes and a revelation that you may guess before, but which you should still find entertaining."

PARKING HELL: THE PARKING INDUSTRY INVESTIGATED Local authorities in England and Wales now make more than £1 billion from the parking business. Yet there are growing accusations of sharp practice, and all over the country motorists are gearing up for battle. Wednesday, 3.20pm: David Nicknam, a North London parking attendant until last May, shuffles nervously down Hampstead High Street explaining the \"tricks\" he says he was taught here for issuing what he nonchalantly calls \"dodgy tickets\". \"I was told to give tickets no matter how legally a car was parked,\" Nicknam says with a disapproving frown, his greying ponytail and wispy beard incongruous among the impeccably groomed ladies strolling up the hill. \"If a driver's got a disabled badge, you write that there's no badge. If there's a visitor's permit, sometimes you ignore it - it's a question of 'Who's going to believe the driver?' And if you ask me if you can park for five minutes to collect someone, I'd be expected to say OK - and then ticket you once you've gone. He doesn't have your name, the thinking goes, so what's he going to do?\" Nicknam, 39, was taking home £226.79 for a 42-hour week when he says he was sacked after three months' probation. The reason, he says, is that he found grounds to ticket only five or six cars \"legally\" in a typical day, rather than the ten or more he says his superiors expected. \"If I wanted to survive, to get a permanent job, I was told I'd have to bring in at least ten tickets no matter how,\" he says with ill-disguised contempt. The scams, he says, ranged from falsely claiming that bays had been suspended to hand-issuing deliberately mistimed tickets after claiming his computer was down. \"I told them, I can't do that. I said I believed in God. I asked my supervisors, 'How do you sleep? Do you lie there dreaming about ticketing cars all night'?\" Camden council rejects his allegations, and, as a clearly disaffected former employee of the council's parking contractor, Nicknam is by no means neutral. He readily accepts that he bears grudges against NCP, whose management, he says, refused to hear his complaints and promoted supervisors who openly broke the rules. Yet his claims – of attendants falsifying observation times, issuing \"ghost\" tickets when cars were not present, dishonestly claiming tyres were outside parking bays – have all been made by other London parking attendants (PAs) in recent months. At stake is public confidence in the entire system of parking enforcement. \"You have to ask why drivers hate the PAs,\" Nicknam reflects as he crosses into Prince Arthur Road, a favourite spot, he explains, for colleagues to hide before pouncing on cars left for three minutes at school pick-up time. \"How many people have spoken out before me? You have to ask why the council doesn't want PAs to help the drivers. You might call it cheating, but I call it stealing.\" He shakes his head and whispers disapprovingly. \"It's money, isn't it? Money talks.\" Council coffers are swelling not simply through parking tickets and bus-lane fines, but also from meter feeds and the sale of permits. Yet by any standards, the business of ticketing, clamping and removing cars is booming as never before. The London boroughs issued almost seven million penalty charge notices in last year, up from 5.4 million in three years ago. Outside London, English and Welsh councils handed out almost three million more. By law, local authorities must regulate parking not primarily to raise money, but \"to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic\". Yet as the surpluses have risen over the years, so have public suspicions about the councils' true agenda. As Brian King, director of the RAC Foundation, sees it, local authorities now see parking as \"a convenient and easy way to raise money, rather than as a policy issue\". Public tolerance is being tested with every television investigation alleging corruption, and with each outraged report of target-fixated attendants ticketing buses, fire engines, even a rabbit-hutch whose owner, delivering to a Manchester pet shop, moved his van before a warden could pounce. \"It's the biggest fraud that goes on,\" claims Jim Carlson, a Pimlico accountant who runs Appeal.com, one of a growing number of websites campaigning against what they see as unjust use of parking regulations to make money. Carlson has heard it all: PAs falsifying information in their notebooks to \"prove\" that correctly parked cars were elsewhere; motorists illegally ticketed long after they had driven off. He makes an annual award to the victim of what he considers the most absurd abuse of a PA's powers. Its latest winner was Nadhim Zahawi, who was handed a penalty charge notice in central London as he lay in the road with a broken leg after coming off his scooter. \"The councils are very happy to allow a poor system to continue, because they get the revenue,\" Carlson says wearily. \"Nobody now has faith in the system. I certainly don't.\" 31 It is claimed in the article that 'dodgy tickets' are B. unfairly given to legally parked cars. 32 Nicknam was fired C. for not giving out enough tickets. 33 Nicknam's reasons for disobeying his employer are A. moral. 34 Multiple claims of dishonest ticketing are B. making people distrustful of the parking system. 35 The business of ticketing, clamping and removing cars is C. making more money than in the past. 36 The conclusion of the article is B. pessimistic."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a novel. Choose from the paragraphs A-G the one which fits each gap (41-46). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Death in Malta Rosanne Dingli. Gregory had the old doctor at his heels, and could hear a slight wheezing coming from the man’s chest. He looked sprightly this morning, with hair well slicked back as usual and sharp creases in his trousers. 41_____ ‘Like this,’ the doctor interrupted. ‘Like we did the first time.’ He was already wrestling the knife back and forth forcibly, trying to edge it underneath the wax seal. The effort gave no result. The wax seemed to have hardened, fused into the porous clay surface of the jar neck. ‘Like this!’ the older man repeated, words coming out in a grunt through clenched teeth. Gregory gently took the knife from his hand when he looked up, sweat standing out in beads on his forehead. Gregory tried himself, levering the blade at a different angle, cautiously forcing it with both hands. 42_____ It was the doctor. He brushed past Gregory to grab the mallet abruptly. His audible breathing filled the cellar, his arm waving, gesturing with the mallet. Almost immediately, Gregory was by his side, but it was already too late. With one massive lunge, he swung the mallet round sideways at waist level, bringing its impact to the broadest curve on the bombul’s side. 43_____ Patricia stood immobile, the expression on her face frozen. ‘What on earth did you do that for?’ she muttered. Gregory watched the doctor squeeze his head between his hands, then turn, looking for something. He looked at the broken pieces of clay at his feet, appearing started to see them and the vinegar that pooled on the ground and drenched his trouser legs and shoes. ‘It’s blood,’ he said, seemingly unaware of anyone else around him. Then he took off in a lop-sided run, out of the cellar door, up the stone steps and away from where the others stood. 44_____ ‘We all waited a week for this,’ Patricia gestured, indicating the wreckage about their feet. ‘He seemed to check there was nothing there, on the floor, before he left,’ she continued, baffled. ‘He said blood. Why did he say that?’ ‘Oh – I don’t know,’ answered Gregory, resigned to the mystery. ‘All our eyes were on the jar. We were all looking to see if there was anything there. Well there isn’t. All there is is vinegar. Just vinegar.’ Patricia started to flick ineffectually at her jeans. 45_____ He had fully expected to see a sodden bundle of clothes and flesh, a little parcel; the remnants of a life, virtually pickled in rancid wine. He had laid awake at night picturing what they would see inside the emptied bombul; grey fabric in colourless tatters preserved by the wine; grey skin angled over bone; the skull rounded and turned forward, over a small caved-in chest. He was surprised it was not there. 46_____ How could she possibly know? He turned to look at her, perplexed, a touch annoyed. He was still not completely accustomed to the way she would never chastise him for having feelings or imaginings, for pre-empting things, for having a totally separate world in his head. He was silent for a long time, allowing her the closeness. ‘But there’s nothing there,’ he said finally. ‘Nothing there,’ she repeated. A. \"Blood?\" Patricia looked at Gregory. \"Why did he say that? Why did he smash the jar?\" Her face was a picture of incredulity. \"I don't know. What a mess,\" said Gregory blankly. \"It was as if he couldn't bear to wait any longer.\" B. Patricia was calm, almost purring like a cat in the sun. Her eyes were bright and she anticipated the work in the cellar with cheery eagerness. The three entered the large room, intent on getting the bombul open. Patricia handed a knife to the doctor. \"I wonder whether this clay jar is full of oil or wine.\" \"Or water,\" answered the old doctor. He turned a bit pale, the heat making his top lip glisten only seconds after he returned his handkerchief to his pocket. \"Now,\" started Gregory, \"If we ...\" C. \"You had imagined it...\" Patricia did not finish. She looked at his eyes. Gregory raised a hand and shielded his eyes from her. She knew him too well, too soon. His feet had still not moved from the puddle of dark vinegar. \"I - yes,\" he said finally, accepting the scrutiny. \"I imagined more than just the words, you see,\" he said softly. She came round to him and touched his arm. \"I know.\" D. Gregory couldn't tell whether she was disappointed or glad they had not discovered anything more gruesome than several litres of acetic wine. He realised he did not initially register surprise at finding nothing in the liquid. But he was surprised. E. The jar smashed, a cry from Patricia accompanying the crashing sound made by the fragments of earthenware and the sudden copious flow of vinegar that splashed out, soaking the three of them from the knees down. As if in slow motion, the Doctor wheeled around on his heels, raising his hands to his head, the mallet falling with hardly a sound to the ground. His face was ashen, his teeth gritted underneath stretched lips. F. Patricia looked at the doctor with a childish glee. The contents that had spilled so tumultuously out onto the floor was everything they had been hoping for. Yet, it was also everything the writer had dreaded. Gregory looked at the other two with a desperate suspicion. \"Why?\" Patricia and the Doctor looked at each other for an answer that would appease their friend. G. \"Shall I try the other side, opposite to you, with another knife?\" asked Patricia. She sensed the doctor's impatience, and was now full of it herself. But Gregory had managed to insert the point of his knife under the wax rim. It was going to require precise movements. Patricia looked as if she was thinking of some other method to remove the wax plug from the jar mouth. Gregory looked at her as she gripped the earthenware rim thoughtfully. Then out of the corner of his eye, a sudden movement made him straighten."

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a musical. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Billy Elliot Four critics comment on the musical theatre production A. T his is not a time to beat about the bush. Billy Elliot strikes me as the greatest British musical I have ever seen and I have not forgotten Lionel Bart's 0/iver! or Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. There is a rawness, a warm humour and a sheer humanity here that are worlds removed from the soulless slickness of most musicals. Yes, there are rough edges that w ould give Cameron Mackintosh a fit of the vapours, yes , there are occasional scenes that are not as powerful ly played as those in the film. But there is so much more that is big and bold, imaginative and great-hearted. Once upon a time, they used to make films out of stage musicals, but these days the traffic is all the other way. Following The Producers, Mary Pop pins and Spama/ot, comes this stage version of Stephen Daldry's beautiful and moving Brit flick about an I 1-year-old boy from a coal-mining village in County Durham, who is determined to become a ballet dancer. B. Turn ing small-scale movies into big musicals is a treacherous business. lt failed with The Full Monty , w hich lost all of its gritty truth when musicalised. But Billy Elliot succeeds brilliantly because Elton John's music and, especially, Peter Darling's choreography enhance Lee Hall's cinematic concept. The musical, even more than the film, counterpoints Billy's personal triumph with the community's decline. Eleven-yearold Billy is an Easington miner's son who overcomes family bigotry and financial hardship to make it to the Royal Ballet School. But a show that begins with grai ny newsreel footage celebrating the nationalisation of the coal industry ends with the collapse of the 1984 miners' strike. Billy's aspirations have been realised, but a local community faces ruin. lt is the tension between those two facts that gives the musical its drive. But, even more significantly, dance is used to express narrative in a way that evokes West Side Story. You see this early on in an extraordinary sequence where the choreographed conflict between the miners and police invades Mrs Wilkinson's dance academy, filled with little girls in tutus. The effect is both comic and tragic, in that it suggests no aspect of Easington life is untouched by a savage industrial dispute. : С. Not since Blood Brothers first opened in 1983, has there been a new British musical to combine social commentary with a heartfelt story of adolescence, as powerfully and melodically as Billy Elliot . Adapted for the stage from the hit film of 2000 by its original director Stephen Daldry, screenwriter Lee Hall and choreographer Peter Darling, who are newly joined by composer Elton John, the material has been deepened and given a vibrant immediacy that can only come from the dynamics of live performance. And the rites-of-passage journey the show charts - of an I 1-year-old boy transcending his working class background to gain admittance to the Royal Ballet School - is played out against the background of the 1984 Miners' Strike, implying the fierceness of Billy's own struggle. D. Together, Stephen Daldry and Lee Hall have concocted a piece that's tougher, bolder and, as my tear-ducts can attest, no matter how hard I tried to disguise it, more moving than its admittedly admirable celluloid precursor. With its rags-to-riches, or rather povertyto-pirouette, story, the piece invites sentimentality. But that's almost entirely missing in the Geordie pit village where young Billy discovers he has a gift for dance. Billy not only has to struggle against a society that could not understand a young boy wanting to enter the world of ballet, but he also, to a certain extent, is forced to turn his back on the traditional job of mining that his father and grandfather before him had endured. Not only is his physical strength pushed to the limits with the demanding training and practice sessions that ballet requires, he also has to harden himself to a path that is without doubt going to be a very lonely one. Against all odds he reaches for the stars and eventually manages to fly. WHICH REVIEWER: 37 unlike the other three, does not compare the musical to previous musicals in the West End?_____ 38 highlights the importance of the economic backdrop from which the musical is set, like reviewer C?_____ 39 like reviewer B, refers to a historical event that serves to accentuate Billy's success?_____ 40 disagrees with the other three reviewers, in finding certain aspects of the film better than the musical?_____"

    "text": "You are going to read an article containing film reviews. For questions 47–56, choose from the reviews (A–F). The reviews may be chosen more than once. IN WHICH FILM REVIEW IS THE FOLLOWING MENTIONED? 47) An actor didn’t win despite performing well. __________ 48) A character plans to kill the leader of a country. __________ 49) Is full of feeling but not successful as a film or DVD. __________ 50) The plot spans over many years. __________ 51) The director of the movie was born in a foreign country. __________ 52) The writers were trying not to dully depict history. __________ 53) The director sees elements of their own life in the film. __________ 54) It is only ideal for a specific group of people. __________ 55) The prospect of violence was exciting. __________ 56) A lot of people die in the film. __________. A. Keira Knightley gives \"her best performance yet\" in Joe Wright’s adaptation of the Jane Austen classic Pride & Prejudice. It snagged her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Actress although she was eventually beaten to the globe by Reese Witherspoon for Walk the Line. Nonetheless this period romance went down well on both sides of the pond. While Austen’s work derives much of its tension from the buttoned-down customs of 18th century society, Matthew Macfadyen, who plays Mr Darcy, finds it all \"quite releasing\". Naturally the cast offers their interpretations although these tend towards the obvious; \"Elizabeth is very human,\" says Keira. She hits closer to the mark in a separate tribute to the novelist, saying, \"She puts across this absolutely gorgeous fairy tale in a rather realistic way.\" B. After endless TV runs of Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson has proved that he’s an inspired physical comedian. His second big screen outing as the tweed-donning doofus was generally better received than the first Bean flick, trading on slapstick shtick rather than fart gags as he travels all over France. The film also did brisk business at home and abroad, raising sacks of cash for Comic Relief. Cameras follow Bean and company on location across the sun-drenched South of France in French Beans. Director Steve Bendelack confesses he’s having a lot of \"fun\", while poor old Atkinson works up a sweat madly cycling after a chicken in a complex chase sequence. While critics talk about Atkinson’s \"effortless\" ability to make people laugh, the man himself doesn’t see it that way, saying that having to carry a film with so much physicality is \"quite stressful\". Obviously this DVD is very much a love it or hate it proposition, but for fans of the TV series, it’s the perfect escape on a wet afternoon. C. Three years after Super Size Me, director Richard Linklater put the burger business through the mincer again. It’s just a shame that Fast Food Nation is slathered in self-importance as it takes the point-of-view of various people affected by the contamination of meat at a Texan processing plant. After opening to mixed reviews, the box office numbers were as flat as a cheap beef patty. He admits that, going into the project, he knew very little about the politics of fast food and even dares to confess, \"I eat meat.\" Oh, and by the way, the meat is also a metaphor for the plight of illegal immigrants. Referring to the character played by Catalina Sandino Moreno, he says, \"It’s about her being turned into a piece of meat.\" Bet you didn’t see that coming, eh? Without question this film is full of heart, unfortunately the mishmash of storylines and speechifying doesn’t go down any easier on the small screen. D. Yes, there is a high body count and a lot of stuff gets blown up but Shooter was not an entirely mindless film. In it, a world-weary ex-Marine sniper gets drawn into a plot to assassinate the US president. Maybe it was this hackneyed premise that meant it fell slightly below target at the box office. Stephen Hunter, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, talks about the inspiration for the story in Survival Of The Fittest. He calls his leading character Bob Lee Swagger \"a Faustian intellectual of war,\" which might be slightly overstating it. Co-star Michael Pepa was apparently thrilled at the chance to shoot people. \"It’s really hard not to get into it,\" he says, later adding, \"The explosions were really neat.\" Somehow we don’t think he quite understood Hunter’s intentions… E. Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair drew on her own experiences for this poignant family saga The Namesake. Adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel about the pains of immigration, it stars Bollywood actress Tabu and erstwhile movie stoner Kal ‘Kumar’ Penn. Although the film didn’t break any box office records, glowing reviews helped to put bums on seats in all corners of the globe. Throughout the film, Nair picks on scenes that resonate with her own experiences of coming to America and raising children there, but she is also very instructive on the technical aspects of filmmaking. She explains why she chooses a close-up over a wide-angle shot and how that decision feeds the underlying emotion of a scene. Aspiring filmmakers will glean lots of practical advice, and for the average film fan, you’ll be transported across continents from the comfort of your own sofa. F. A period political drama is never an easy sell at the box office. Take the example of Amazing Grace, starring Ioan Gruffudd as bewigged human rights activist William Wilberforce. For director Michael Apted the challenge was in trying to show \"how heroic politics can be\", while trying to avoid a dry historical re-enactment of Wilberforce’s life, and instead put the focus on the battle between young revolutionaries and a fusty establishment. About his preparations for the role Gruffudd says that, as well as reading up on British/African history, there was the matter of how to age convincingly on screen. The young actor light-heartedly assures us that lots of makeup was involved because making him look old is \"very hard to do…\". Despite the weighty themes it deals with, the surprise is that, overall, this DVD isn’t as heavy as you’d think."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, Cor D) which you think fits best according to the text. What makes us different? You don't have to be a biologist or an anthropologist to see how closely the great apes - gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans - resemble us. Even a child can see that their bodies are pretty much the same as ours, apart from some exaggerated proportions and extra body hair. Apes have dexterous hands much like ours but unlike those of any other creature. And, most striking of all, their faces are uncannily expressive, showing a range of emotions that are eerily familiar. That's why we delight in seeing chimps wearing tuxedos, playing the drums or riding bicycles. it's why a potbellied gorilla scratching itself in the zoo reminds us of Uncle Ralph or Cousin Vinnie; and why, in a more unsettled reaction, Queen Victoria, on seeing an orangutan named Jenny at the London Zoo in 1842, declared the beast \"frightful and painfully and disagreeably human.\" lt isn't just a superficial resemblance. Chimps, especially, not only look like us, they also share with us some human-like behaviours. They make and use tools and teach those skills to their offspring. They prey on other animals and occasionally murder each other. They have complex social hierarchies and some aspects of what anthropologists consider culture. They can't form words, but they can learn to communicate via sign language and symbols and to perform complex cognitive tasks. Scientists figured out decades ago that chimps are our nearest evolutionary cousins, roughly 98% to 99% identical to humans at the genetic level. When it comes to DNA, a human is closer to a chimp than a mouse is to a rat. Yet tiny differences, sprinkled throughout the genome, have made all the difference. Agriculture, language, art, music, technology and philosophy - all the achievements that make us profoundly different from chimpanzees and make a chimp in a business suit seem so deeply ridiculous - are somehow encoded within minute fractions of our genetic code. Nobody yet knows precisely where they are or how they work, but somewhere in the nuclei of our cells are handfuls of amino acids, arranged in a specific order, that endow us with the brainpower to outthink and outdo our closest relatives on the tree of life. They give us the ability to speak and write and read, to compose symphonies, paint masterpieces and delve into the molecular biology that makes us what we are. Until recently, there was no way to unravel these crucial differences. Exactly what gives us advantages like complex brains and the ability to walk upright, and certain disadvantages, including susceptibility to a particular type of malaria, AIDS and Alzheimer's, diseases that don't seem to afflict chimps, remained a mystery. But that's rapidly changing. Just a year ago, geneticists announced that they had sequenced a rough draft of the chimpanzee genome, allowing the first side-by-side comparisons of human and chimpanzee DNA. Already, that research has led to important discoveries about the development of the human brain over the past few million years and possibly about our ancestors' mating behaviour as well. And sometime in the next few weeks, a team led by molecular geneticist Svante Pobo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, will announce an even more stunning achievement: the sequencing of a significant fraction of the genome of Neanderthals - the human-like species we picture when we hear the word caveman - who are far closer to us genetically than chimps are. And though Neanderthals became extinct tens of thousands of years ago, Pobo is convinced he's on the way to reconstructing the entire genome of that longlost relative, using DNA extracted, against all odds, from a 38,000-year-old bone. Laid side by side, these three sets of genetic blueprints - plus the genomes of gorillas and other primates, which are already well on the way to being completely sequenced - will not only begin to explain precisely what makes us human but could lead to a better understanding of human diseases and how to treat them. 31 What is something apes do NOT do that humans do? A. communicate B. kill their own kind C. walk on two limbs D. have a social order 32 A mouse and a rat are mentioned A. because they are also similar to humans genetically. B. in order to demonstrate the variety of species that exist. C. to highlight the difference between our genetic code and theirs.

Robots to the rescue. Ten years old, he moved with his father across the curved polished floor of the freight bay, their booted feet squeaking on the high-gloss surface; the two of them suspended above their own dark reflections; a man and a boy forever walking up what looked to the eye like an ever steepening hill, but which always felt perfectly level. \"We're going outside, aren't we,\" Sky said. Titus looked down at his son. \"Why do you assume that?\" \"You wouldn't have brought me here otherwise.\" 41)_____ Now however – in a mood of eager forgiveness – he pushed such thoughts from his mind; awed by the sheer size of the freight bay and the prospect of what lay ahead. What made the place seem all the larger was the fact that the two of them were quite alone. The rest of the chamber was suggested rather than clearly seen; its dimensions only hinted at by the dark. 42)_____ After what seemed like days, the adults had made the main lights come on again. He noticed the air-circulators began to work again. All that time, his father told him later, they had been breathing unrecirculated air; slowly turning staler and staler as the hundred and fifty waking humans dumped more and more carbon dioxide back into their atmosphere. It soon would have started causing serious problems, but the air became fresher and the ship slowly warmed back up until it was possible to move along the corridors without shivering. The food improved, but Sky had hardly noticed that they had been eating emergency rations during the black-out. 43)_____ Titus halted near one of the small shuttles. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we're going outside. I think it's time you saw things the way they really are.\" \"What things?\" But by way of answer Titus only elevated the cuff of his uniform and spoke quietly into his bracelet. \"Enable excursion vehicle 15.\" 44)_____ Sky hopped into the spacecraft, feeling the floor vibrating beneath his feet. The taxi was considerably more cramped inside than it had appeared it would be – the hull thickly plated and armoured – and he had to duck to reach his seat, brushing his head against a gristle-like tangle of internal pipework. He fiddled with the blue-steel buckle until he had it tight across his chest. In front of him was a cool turquoise green display – constantly changing numbers and intricate diagrams. 45)_____ \"Word of advice, Sky. Never trust these damned things to tell you that they're safe. Make sure for yourself.\" \"You don't trust machines to tell you?\" 46)_____ \"What happened to change your mind?\" \"You'll see, shortly.\". A. Parked here and there were various spacecraft. The taxis could enter the atmosphere in an emergency, but they were not designed to make the return trip to space. The delta-winged landers which would make multiple journeys down to the surface of Journey's End were too large to store inside the Santiago; they were attached instead to the outside of the ship and there was almost no way to see them unless you worked on one of the external work crews, as his mother had done before her death. B. There was no hesitation; no questioning his authority. The taxi answered him instantly, lights flicking on; cockpit door craning open. Steam was beginning to vent from ports spaced along the vehicle's side, and Sky could hear the growing whine of turbines somewhere inside the machine's angular hull. He hesitated at the door, until his father beckoned that he lead. \"After you, Sky. Go and take the seat on the right of the instrument column. Don't touch anything while you're about it.\" C. Titus said nothing, but the point could not be denied. Sky had never been in the freight bay before; not even during one of the ill icit trips with Constanza. Sky remembered the time she had taken him to see the dolphins, and the punishment that had ensued, and how that punishment had been eclipsed by the ordeal that had fol lowed; the flash of light and the period he had spent trapped alone and cold in the utter darkness of the nursery. lt seemed so long ago now, but there were still things that he did not ful ly understand. No one would speak of that day when the whole ship had turned dark and cold, yet to Sky the events were still clearly fixed in his memory. D. His father settled into the seat next to him. The door had closed on them now, and suddenly it was quieter, save for the continuous rasp of the taxi's air-circulation. Hi s father touched the green display with his finger, making it change, studying the results with narrow-eyed concentration. E. \"I used to, once.\" His father eased the joystick forward now and the taxi commenced gliding along its departure track, sliding past the parked ranks of other vehicles. \"But machines aren't infallible. We used to kid ourselves that they were because it was the only way to stay sane in a place like this, where we depend on them for our every breath. Unfortunately it was never true.\" F. The spacecraft had some technical difficulty upon it's take-off. Titus and Sky jolted precariously as their taxi struggled to break through the atmosphere. Sky could feel his body begin to tremble with fear, but focused all his energy preventing that from happening. He did not dare let his father see him being anything but brave. G. Eventually, when something like normal shipboard life had returned, Sky managed to sneak back into the nursery. The room was lit, but everything else looked more or less as he had left it; Clown frozen in that distorted shape he had assumed after the flash. Sky had crept closer to examine his friend. Clown had been a kind of moving picture that only made sense when seen from precisely Sky's point of view. Clown had seemed to be physically present in the room - not just painted on the wall . For three years, Sky had never doubted that Clown was in some sense real. Yet his parents had given up responsibility to an illusion. "

    "text": "You are going to read four reviews of a ballet. For questions 37-40, choose from reviews A-D. The reviews may be chosen more than once. Romeo and juliet Four critics comment on the ballet production A. Returning to the stage after a long injury, Natalya Osipova is back in peak condition. She takes real risks in the giddy, swooning steps, swooping right off balance and trusting her Romeo, Carlos Acosta, to catch her. Yet this revival just falls short of passion. There's plenty of care in the storytelling, but the ballet's star-crossed lovers need headlong ardour and despair. it's been a long wait for Osipova to come back. She had surgery on her foot more than a year ago, with several return performances announced and cancelled. She's a sleek dancer, tall and dark, prompting extra attention. This performance shows new thought in her acting. Juliet is dancing with Paris, her approved fiance, when she first sees Romeo. She can't take her eyes off him, even when she tries to remember Paris. B. As one of the jewels in the Royal Ballet's crown, this rendition of Romeo and juliet offers a rare opportunity for dancer and spectator to forge a close relationship. Familiar as the story is, we can focus our entire attention on the interpretation without having to wonder what's coming next. In spite of Nicholas Georgiadis' monumental sets, this latest production is characterised by its extraordinary intimacy. lt takes a while to warm up as Carlos Acosta's Romeo doesn't appear to be unduly upset by his failed courtship of Rosaline and only really takes flight with the arrival of the three firecracker harlots (Laura Morera, Romany Pajdak and Laura McCulloch) who blast through the townspeople with exuberant naughtiness. As a prelude to the street fight between the Capulets and the Montagues, it is a terrific sequence, full of dazzle and spark. The key sequence that unlocks the production, is the grand ball with Prokoviev's magnificently doom-laden, Dance of the Knights, thundering out of the pit before the first encounter between the two lovers. С. Not quite what one m ight have hoped. Natalya Osipova's debut as Juliet with the Royal Ballet was eagerly anticipated: here is an artist prodigious in technique, vivid in dramatic sensibilities, who has illuminated every role t hat I have seen her dance. And yet on Thursday night, she seemed isolated at moments from the staging. This was, I sense, in part owed to an unlikely relationship with Carlos Acosta's Romeo. Osipova's pairing with Acosta brings her a secure partner, but also a dancer whose account of his role is now underpowered in both means and manner: I did not for a moment believe in him as a youth ardently in love. But what I once saw with Lynn Seymour, and saw with Natalya Makarova, and then ravishingly saw again last week with Yevgenia Obraztsova in the arms of Steven McRae was the traditional interpretation of the role. Unfortunately, Osipova, in trying to make the role her own, decides to show a knowing Juliet. D. The slim shoulders of the Russian ballerina Natalia Osipova were carrying a twin weight as she made her debut with London's Royal Ballet. Would this international shooting star be able to add lustre to a company that is depleted of ballerinas of her class? The answers to those questions varied from moment to moment during the course of the evening. Rarely has a performance flickered so rapidly between the astonishing and the disappointing. Having said that, the overall impression was satisfying, as one would expect from a dance company that has such a high profile leading lady. lt will be interesting to see how she continues to settle in with future productions with the Royal Ballet. WHICH REVIEWER: like reviewer A, remains unconvinced of the dancers' portrayal of the passion between Romeo and Juliet? 37_____; like reviewer C, had eagerly anticipated Osipova's performance, only to be disappointed in some way? 38_____; disagrees with the other three reviewers, in finding Osipova's performance faultless? 39_____; compares and contrasts this rendering with past performances of Romeo and Juliet? 40_____."

Football players A. I started playing football seriously at a very young age. I played on teams all year long. But even that wasn't enough. When my dad would get home from work, we'd pass the ball back and forth until supper. As I got older, I'd invite my three best friends to come over to my house. They didn't really like football, but we had an agreement; I'd give them a snack, we'd watch a little TV, then we would play. One against three, and if I won, they had to play me again. During university I had a chance to try-out for a professional team in Germany and I thought, 'this is my chance to really make my dreams come true.' Yet, when I arrived in Germany, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had made a huge mistake. To make a long story short, I made the team, but turned them down and returned home. I had realised that my dream wasn't all I had built it up to be. I had imagined the glory of that life, but what I failed to consider was the fact that I would be doing it all alone, without my family and friends. So, I came home, finished university, and began coaching football. I love my job, and I still get to play football. it's more fun now than it's ever been. B. I come from a family of footballers. My dad played in competitive leagues all hi s life and my mum was on the national team. Needless to say, I began playing football at about the same time I began to walk. I played on the top teams since the age of thirteen. I was always the best on my team by far but, considering my background, that was expected. My parents were very committed to my football career and on some level I am very grateful. However, at times, their zeal was a little overwhelming. lt was always in my head that I was playing football mostly to please my parents, which really stripped the joy of the game from me. I still remember when my team won the biggest youth tournament in the nation. All my teammates were crying with joy and were so proud; I was just happy the tournament was over so I could go home and be with my friends. That's when I realised that while I may have the talent for the game, I didn't have the passion for it. So at age 16 I told my parents I didn't want to play anymore. I couldn't believe how supportive they were. I guess I put most of the pressure on myself. C. Football was always just one of my extra-curricular activities. I was president of my class at school, a member of the school orchestra, on the debate team, and in the autumn, I played football. I was a decent player, but definitely not the best. Tactics weren't my strength, but I was tough! lt was always a joke that I chose to go through other players, rather than around them. Of course, that aggressiveness didn't come without consequences. I left many games covered in bruises and blood, but the worst came the summer before my final year in high school when I was seriously injured and had to have knee surgery. I was devastated because I was supposed to be team captain that year and I was afraid they were going to take the title away from me. Lucki ly, I still got to be captain and I really loved my role from the sideline. I worked hard at my theraPY and was able to play in the last game of the season, which was great, but I had learned that my talents are best used on the sideline. I've been coaching youth teams for five years now. D. My parents were tired of me doing nothing but play video games so one day they said I was starting football practice. I protested a bit, but I knew my efforts would be worthless. My parents are unmovable. I have always hated exercise. I admit it. I am lazy. I went to practice prepared with multiple excuses to sit on the sidelines. I was getting the flu, I twisted my ankle, I was asthmatic. Yet, when I got there, I could tell by the look of the coach that he wasn't the kind of man who put up with excuses. There was something in his presence that told me he meant business. So I played the whole practice. And I really was the most awkward one out there. I never learned to love that game, but being on a team had some perks; at the end of every game some parent brought snacks. The snacks were undoubtedly the best part. I stuck with football until high school then became involved with the school newspaper, which really suits me better, considering I am not the world's best athlete. E. I've been a professional footballer for fifteen years now. That may seem like a lot considering my age, but older generations of women did not have the opportunity to play as youths. So when England decided to start its fir st women's national team, they had to recruit from a younger age group. The first five years were quite difficult. The team had basically no money. We stayed in cheap motel rooms or set up mats on gymnasium floors when we travelled. For a long time, despite our success, we had no fans, no news coverage, nothing. lt was definitely frustrating, but I also believe it is a huge testament to our love of the game. We didn't play for the glory or the fame. We played because we loved it. This is not to say we are not enjoying the recent attention being focused on our team; it is sure nice to finally be recognised, praised and admired for our hard work and talent. We have been through so much together, I feel like my teammates are my family. I work hard mainly because I know I owe it to them. And we support each other and encourage each other when one of us has made a mistake or is having a tough time getting through training. I'm a better player and person because of my teammates. true.\" F. The spacecraft had some technical difficulty upon it's take-off.
