    "text": "You are going to read an article written by a young pianist. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Berrak: A pianist I started playing the piano when I was four years old. My mother thought it would be a good outlet for positive childish energy and I was really into it; it was exciting. It was something different and I had much more time to practise then. The first time I performed in front of an audience was when I was five years old and I loved it. I went on a summer camp run by my piano teachers at the time and at the end of the week we all got up and played a piece. At that age I was unaware of any of the pressure associated with performing live so it just felt nice to have people concentrating on my playing and I liked the applause and attention. Now I perform regularly, often in front of large audiences, and I still really enjoy it. I always knew I wanted to be a pianist and never thought I would do anything else. In that respect I felt different from my friends when I went to school; they all thought they wanted to become teachers or doctors and things like that and I just knew I would be a pianist but it didn’t feel strange. Finding time to play and practise wasn’t a problem at school until my last few years when the pressure of exams and things was hard, but generally I would choose to practise instead of doing homework. It always felt like schoolwork got in the way of playing the piano rather than the other way around. Unfortunately I was never given any special allowances or extended deadlines though. After I finished school I went on to study a degree in music and now I’m studying a Masters degree in accompaniment. A typical day now involves a couple of hours practice in the morning before going into college and attending classes. I spend a lot of time in the library listening to music, trying to learn and become familiar with new pieces of music. One downside to choosing to study and pursue a career in music is that you end up spending hours and hours by yourself. However, I also try to spend time at college meeting other people and networking. The more musicians I know the more likely I am to be asked to play for others. The more I play the better known I become and in the music business it’s all about recognition and getting your name out there. It's important to get involved in as many performances as possible and take part in competitions so that as many people as possible see you perform and know who you are. It’s a very competitive industry. Ultimately, if I am asked to play and get given a job it means that someone else loses work and sometimes it feels like a constant battle. You can’t help being drawn into an artificial world where you are constantly comparing yourself to others and are always worried about what others think of your performances. In the real world outside of college your audience is much wider. I chose to get involved in accompaniment because as much as I love playing the piano I also enjoy working with others. And working as an accompanist is a good way of doing that. There are also more job opportunities as although there is still a lot of competition other performers will always need good accompanists, so there is more demand. I really enjoy performing with other people because there’s an even greater sense of achievement when you are both on form and a piece comes out amazingly. To follow a career in music you have to have a real passion for it as unfortunately it’s not a very secure path and it’s not usually very well paid. Having said that, the real positive side is that I am doing something I love; it’s not just a subject to study. I love everything associated with music and performing and it’s what I do every day. Questions: 1. How did Berrak feel about playing the piano when she was very young? (A) She really enjoyed it. (B) She only did it because her mother wanted her to. (C) She didn’t like the fact she had to practice a lot. (D) She felt strange and different from her friends. 2. How did she feel the first time she performed in front of an audience? (A) nervous and under pressure (B) strange because everyone was looking at her (C) happy and relaxed (D) She was concentrating so much on playing she didn’t notice the audience. 3. Why did Berrak feel different from her friends when she was at school? (A) Because the teachers gave her less homework. (B) Because her friends didn't know what career they wanted to follow. (C) Because she was the only one who wanted to become a musician. (D) Because she found the pressure of exams less stressful. 4. Why does she say it is important to meet and talk to other musicians at her college? (A) Because the music industry is very sociable and it’s important to have lots of friends. (B) Because she feels lonely after spending so much time by herself. (C) Because other musicians in the college are very supportive of each other. (D) Because it increases her possibilities of being asked to perform. 5. When she says in line 22 that ‘in the music business it’s all about recognition and getting your name out there’ what does she mean? (A) It’s important that people know who she is when they see her photograph. (B) It’s important that lots of people know what she does and know her name. (C) Her name is more important than the way she plays. (D) Her name needs to be easy for people to recognise and remember. 6. Why does the college environment often feel like a constant battle? (A) Because there isn’t enough work for everyone. (B) Because she doesn’t get on with the other students there. (C) Because there are lots of competitions. (D) Because the teachers are always comparing the students and deciding who is better. 7. Why did Berrak decide to go into accompaniment? (A) Because she thinks it can be more challenging. (B) Because it’s better paid. (C) Because she can achieve more and become more well-known. (D) Because she likes working as part of a team. 8. What does she say is the best thing about studying and pursuing a career in music? (A) She could become rich and famous. (B) There are lots of job opportunities. (C) She spends all her time doing something she loves. (D) She finds it an easy subject."

    "text": "You are going to read an article by retired lawyer and keen cook John Griffiths. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Cooking for friends. Choosing the degree I should study for at university was quite difficult for me as there were two careers that I found equally attractive: the law and catering. After much soul searching, I realised that whilst I could be a lawyer during the day and then enjoy cookery as a form of relaxation, the reverse was not true. Thus, I opted for a law degree and made food and wine my number one hobby. I have never regretted this decision. Working as a lawyer provided a good living and allowed me enough spare time to indulge myself by enjoying some very fine food and wines at many superb restaurants. A life in catering would have meant that I would always have been working when my friends were playing and vice versa. The hours that have to be worked by chefs are quite ridiculous. They have to arrive at their restaurant by mid-morning, at the latest, to prepare for lunch. They work all afternoon dealing with the business side of their establishment and developing new recipes. Then, they must prepare for evening service probably crawling into bed in the small hours of the next morning feeling absolutely shattered! Sharing my love of fine food and wines with good friends in the relaxed atmosphere of my home has more than compensated for not owning a restaurant. Being a professional chef probably would have meant that, by now, I would be sick of the sight of food, much as I am completely turned off by the merest mention of anything to do with the law! Planning a meal for people I love is a great pleasure. I have a vast collection of cookery books and I am an avid fan of many a TV chef. The problem I have, therefore, is choosing what to cook from so many different possibilities. How do I choose? Well, that depends very much on the friends. A starting point has to be catering for their own likes and dislikes and trying to avoid serving them the same dishes as last time they visited. I don’t claim to be anything other than an enthusiastic amateur but quite a few friends appear to be daunted by the prospect of cooking for me. They seem to think that some of the food I produce is better than they can do and, not wanting to appear to be a show-off or to overwhelm them, I sometimes hold back and cook something simpler than the more adventurous fare I might really have wanted to try. The friends I like cooking for most of all are those who share the love of food and wine as much as I do and who are quite happy to reciprocate, in grand style, when I pay them a return visit. Generally, my cooking has become less complex and pretentious over the years and, although I use recipe books and TV chefs as inspiration, I tend to find that the best way of deciding what to cook is to see what is available when I do the shopping. Years ago, I would have retired early to bed with a great heap of books around me, ploughing through them trying to find recipes that would be seasonal, suitable and impressive only to find that, when I visited the shops, many of the ingredients I needed were either unavailable or not very good. Nowadays, I tend to do the reverse: what I cook is controlled by what I have been able to buy. I might have had one or two vague ideas but, more often than not, I am scrabbling through pages of recipes trying to find something new to do with some scallops, a leg of lamb and a punnet of raspberries. I nearly always buy some creme fraiche, a bunch of coriander and some seasonal vegetables. My store cupboard is pretty good and I can usually find all the spices I need, together with onions, garlic, chillies and boring stuff like flour, butter and so on. I strongly believe that if you have good ingredients you will be able to turn out something worth eating. At the end of a meal there is nothing better than settling down with a strong espresso and a dish of the very best chocolates. The very best of friends can normally provide entertaining conversation but, to me, the finest compliment I can be paid is that they aren’t afraid of gently nodding off. It shows that they feel satisfied, relaxed and happy as a result of my efforts. A: How do you fit a decent social life into that sort of existence? B: The choices I make depend not only on the wines that might best complement the food but also upon the preferences of my guests. C: However, it was the luxury of having the time to cook for friends at home that underlined the good sense of the decision I had made. D: Another factor is their attitude to their own cooking skills. E: It is not unusual for me to simply make everything up as I go along! F: It is one of the great joys of my life and cooking has remained fun. G: This means that, very often, I don’t know what I am giving my friends until a few hours before they arrive. H: For these friends, I like to pull out all the stops!"

    "text": "You are going to read an article in which five people talk about why they enjoy camping. For questions 16-30 choose from the people (A-E). The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: likes being in the open air surrounded by wildlife? gives some advice on things you should take with you? gives an example of people working together to solve a difficult situation? is looking for variety when he/she goes on holiday? doesn’t want to meet the people he/she works with when on holiday? mentions something you can’t do on campsites? has enjoyed camping for many years? likes to make last-minute decisions about where to go on holiday? talks about making friends while staying at campsites? mentions a possible problem when arriving at campsites? says they can’t choose when they go away on holiday? has been to the same campsite more than once? sees price as a main priority? The Joys of Camping. Camping has been a popular choice for holiday accommodation for a long time but it seems that now its popularity is on the increase. Kate Reilly speaks to 5 dedicated campers and finds out why they prefer to pitch their tents or park their camper vans rather than stay in hotels or rent apartments. A Ben: a teacher. For Ben the most important thing is to find a cheap and affordable option during the busy school holidays. ‘Because I have to go away during the peak season when all the schools are on holiday it’s often difficult to find cheap hotel deals or holidays flats for rent,’ he explains. In addition to this he enjoys the flexibility camping offers. ‘I’m not that good at planning ahead and like to be spontaneous with my travel plans. The fact that it’s not usually necessary to pre-book to stay at a campsite suits me very well. I also like that I can go away to more obscure and remote places and get away from the students I spend all year in the classroom with. D Eli and Catriona: doctor and medical researcher. Eli and Catriona explain why camping is the perfect holiday for families. ‘We used to go camping when we were much younger, before we had children and loved it but now we have the boys it makes even more sense. There are so many child-friendly campsites with swimming pools and special activities for kids. It’s so nice for them to have lots of space to run around in and other children to play with. It also means we have time ourselves to really relax. We’ve actually been to the same campsite for 2 years in a row now as we all had such a good time there the first year. The boys are still in touch with friends they made there last year so we might well go back again this year. C Matt: IT engineer. Matt likes to spend his holiday seeing lots of different places. ‘I’m a restless person so when I go away on holiday I don’t like to be tied down to one place; camping means you can stay for two nights in one place then pack up the tent, jump in the car and stay somewhere else for the next night or two and so on with no need to book ahead. It’s a great way to see lots of different places in a short period of time.’ He also points out that, ‘You obviously need a car to really be able to make the most of your time and make sure you have a good map and a good up-to-date campsite guide with clear directions to help you find the different campsites. Campsites are often not well signposted and there is nothing more frustrating than driving around for hours looking for a campsite when you’d rather be relaxing. Cathy: finance director. Cathy is looking for a contrast from her stressful working life when she goes on holiday. She says, ‘I love being outside and the freedom camping offers. I spend all day in the office when I'm at work and have to be very organised to meet tight deadlines, so when I'm on holiday I like to be in the fresh air and be able to do exactly what I want when I want; camping is perfect for that. Of course there are some rules you have to respect like you’re not allowed to make noise after 11 or 12 at night but I like that. I love going to sleep listening to nature.' E Melissa and Stefano: salon manager and marketing director. Melissa and Stefano travel around Europe in their campervan and every year they meet many interesting people and make friends with people from all over the world. Everyone is always so helpful when you stay on a campsite. If you need to borrow something like matches your neighbours will always help you out. One year they got the back wheels of the campervan stuck in the sand and it took ten of their new neighbours to help push it out. Everyone came rushing over to help as soon as they saw there was a problem and most of them didn’t even speak the same language. It was a wonderful feeling; you don’t get that in hotels."

    "image_description":"Candidate A - Top Image: The first person appears to be lying down on a grassy area near the water. They are dressed in formal clothes, with their arms stretched out and lying on their stomach. The scene suggests a peaceful and calm environment, possibly after a busy period, where the individual is taking a break or enjoying the surrounding nature. The view of the sea and green grass offers a serene atmosphere that encourages relaxation and unwinding. Bottom Image: The second image shows three people lying on their backs on a grassy field, likely after a hike or camping. They have outdoor equipment like sleeping mats (blue and purple) near them, suggesting they are resting after a long walk or exploring the mountains. The mountainous landscape in the background emphasizes the outdoor adventure and the need to relax in such a tranquil setting. The relaxed postures and the fact that they are in a natural, open space show they are taking a break from their activity to rest and enjoy the view. Question: Why do you think the people are relaxing in these places?. Candidate B - The image consists of two different scenes, both involving cars and their significance to the people in them. Question: \"How important do you think the cars are to these people?\" Top Image: The first image shows a man in a uniform, likely a chauffeur or a driver, sitting in the front seat of a car. He is looking directly at the camera, tipping his cap, which indicates a friendly and professional demeanor. The interior of the car is visible, showing a typical car dashboard. His role seems to involve driving others, suggesting that the car is an essential part of his job and a primary tool for his profession. His interaction with the car, as seen through his pose and gesture, shows the car is a vital aspect of his work. Bottom Image: The second image features a race car driver standing beside his car, which is parked on snow-covered ground. He is dressed in a racing suit, wearing gloves and a helmet, ready for the race. The car, labeled with the number \"2,\" appears to be a competition vehicle, emphasizing the importance of the car in his profession. The car seems to be central to the driver's career, and it is implied that it plays a crucial role in his success. His body language, as he prepares for the race, indicates that the car is an indispensable part of his life, directly tied to his identity as a driver. Both individuals rely heavily on their cars, but in different contexts — one for professional driving and the other for competitive racing."

Emily woke up before her alarm went off and knew instantly something wasn’t quite right in the house. Bailey, her chocolate-coloured pet Labrador, should have been there at the bedroom door demanding food but there was no sound of him. She decided to get up and go and see where he was. It felt cold in the hall but she knew she had left the heating on last night. As she walked down the stairs she heard a noise in the kitchen; the strange feeling that something was wrong was getting stronger. What was going on? She got to the bottom of the stairs and opened the door to the living room, which led to the kitchen. Why was the door closed? She always left it open. Bailey was nowhere to be seen and his toys, which were usually all over the living room floor, were in a neat pile in the corner next to his basket. Had they been there when she had gone to bed last night? She couldn’t remember. She walked into the kitchen and turned the light on, it didn’t work, nothing happened. She stood very still and listened, nothing. There wasn’t a sound. That was really strange; she lived in the middle of a busy city, there were always people around. She woke up to the sound of traffic, car horns, police cars, her neighbours shouting in the house next door, how could there be silence at 8 o’clock on a Friday morning? She went back into the living room and turned the TV on, but again nothing happened. She went back into the kitchen and looked out of the window; it was a bright clear day. The back door was shut but when she tried the handle she realised it was unlocked. She walked out into the tiny back garden and opened the back gate; still nothing, not a sound and no sign of Bailey. She called him but he didn’t come. She went back into the house and called her mother. No answer. She called her boyfriend but his mobile was switched off. She tried a couple of other numbers but with equal success. She sat down on the sofa and thought about what to do. Just as she decided the best thing would be to stay at home and wait, there was a loud banging on the front door. She jumped up and ran to the door. 'Who is it?' she shouted. 'It’s me,' came the reply. But she had no idea who 'me' was. She walked back into the living room and tried to look through the front window to see who was standing there. It was a man but she couldn’t make out who he was; he didn’t look familiar. He was tall and was wearing a big coat with a hood. She saw that the man had Bailey with him, and Bailey seemed quite happy. She still wasn’t taking any chances though; she put the safety latch on the door and opened it just enough. It was her brother, who lived a few streets away. She opened the door and let him in. Bailey was excited. 'So what’s going on?' she asked. He looked at her strangely: 'Haven’t you heard?' Questions: 1. How did Emily know there was something wrong? (A) Alarm didn’t go off (B) Dog wasn’t there (C) Dog was quiet (D) She woke up early. 2. How did she feel when opening the living room door? (A) confused (B) excited (C) annoyed (D) strong. 3. What could she hear in the kitchen? (A) traffic (B) silence (C) television (D) garden noise. 4. Why did she go into the garden? (A) weather (B) talk to neighbours (C) find Bailey (D) make call. 5. Who did she speak to on the phone? (A) mother (B) boyfriend (C) two friends (D) no one. 6. Why did she return to the living room after the knock? (A) didn’t want to leave (B) see who it was (C) avoid talking (D) think what to do. 7. Why did she think she knew the man? (A) recognised clothes (B) Bailey barked (C) Bailey was relaxed (D) recognised voice. 8. What does 'not taking any chances' mean?

    "text": "Part 2 You are going to read an article in which stage manager Adam James talks about his work in technical theatre. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Technical Theatre When we go to the theatre we go to see the actors and their performance; the stage is the central focus point; it is where everything happens, or at least everything that we the audience are supposed to see. But there is so much more to putting on a performance than just the acting cast. There is a whole team of people who we never see but without whom no production would be possible. We spoke to Adam James who has worked in technical theatre since the age of 14 to find out what goes on behind the scenes and how he got involved. I was 12 years old when I first saw a show in my local leisure centre. I was fascinated by the fact that everything came in about ten lorries and they basically built a theatre from scratch. I 9 I 1 I got to know some of the people working on the stage management team and they let me shadow them while they worked. I met the stage manager and after watching the team work and talking to him I decided that was what I wanted to do as a job. I didn’t know anything about work in the theatre industry so I started studying and learning about the job. I 10 I l However, what I really wanted was to get involved and start working as part of a stage management team. Once I was 14 I managed to get some work experience and I started to miss school sometimes and go to work at the theatre instead. I left school when I was 16 and because I had quite a lot of experience I was able to get a job as an assistant stage manager in a theatre in London. I worked there for about a year and then did some freelance work in Cornwall and went on tours around the country. I 11 I 1 Working on tour was intense but really good fun. A typical Monday would see us arrive at about 8 o’clock in the morning and open up the lorries. We would have some coffee and then when everyone had arrived we would spend the day building the show. In the afternoon the cast would arrive and I would show them around so they knew where they could make quick costume changes and things like that. I 12 1 1 Once the show had started it was just a case of watching and supervising and letting the show happen around us. As stage manager I was always the first and the last person on stage. Working on tour can be stressful as you have to keep track of where everyone is for health and safety reasons and monitor everything that goes on back stage and keep to time. Then once the show is over you have to check everything and make a note of everything that needs repairing or re-doing before the next performance. After a couple of years touring I decided to return to London and go to college to study technical theatre. I studied for a year but I realised that it wasn’t very useful to me. I had learnt a lot more from my years working. 13 1 I I felt like I was already established in the industry so I decided to leave college and got a job in a theatre. When finding work in technical theatre first hand experience is much more important than qualifications. I 14 I I did some more freelance work in London for a while and now I work for a production company. You can have up to 20 people working on any one performance so there’s a real team spirit. There are people working in lighting, sound, wardrobe, wigs, props, carpentry and stage management. Apart from the technical side we also have to look after the actors. As stage manager it’s my job to meet and greet the cast on their first day and make sure they know where everything is and have everything they need. The hardest thing I’ve ever had to do was try to control 2,500 primary school children. I really like what I do. There are of course a number of disadvantages; I don’t like the hours and the disruption to my personal life that working evenings can cause. I 15 I I But I would highly recommend it to others; it’s very enjoyable and always different; you never have the same day twice and there’s something very exciting and beautiful about live theatre. A It was a course for people who didn’t know anything about the theatre. В The more I found out about technical theatre the more interested I became. С Also there’s quite a lot of instability and insecurity to the job and the money is not always good. D While the cast were getting ready we would get on with any necessary maintenance jobs. E I was very curious as I watched the whole thing being put together and I found it hugely exciting. F Working in a large theatre is much more difficult because there are so many more people to organise. G The work was quite sporadic but the money was good; in one month I could earn enough to last me six months. H Theatres are looking for people with proven ability and who know what they are doing, and what interests them the most on your CV is your last job."

I 29 I I didn’t enjoy the event as much as the preparation? ! 30 | | Raising money for charity Housewife and grandmother I abseiled off a cliff to raise money for charity. It was an enormous challenge as I’m actually quite afraid of heights. It was only really the moment of going over the edge that was difficult; after that it was very easy. You just have to get into the rhythm and not go too fast. My son is very into climbing and things like that and he and some of his friends from his university climbing club set everything up and organised the whole event. There were about twenty of us who did it and between us we raised well over the target amount. It was a great success but I don’t think I’ll be doing anything like that again. Once was enough! В Lawyer I ran a triathlon and managed to get over 50 people to sponsor me. I had to train for months and it was really hard work but well worth it. I actually enjoyed the training more than the final event because on the day the weather was terrible. In the months running up to the event I followed a very strict regime and it felt good to be working towards such a specific goal. I would often get up at 5 o’clock in the morning so I could train before going to work. Knowing that I was going to be able to give a large donation to charity made me even more determined to do it. It wasn’t compulsory to get sponsorship and giving money to charity wasn’t my main motivation when I first signed up to do it but I wanted to make the most of the opportunity and all my friends and family were really supportive and wanted to help and give money. It was such a positive experience I’m going to do it again next year. Theatre manager When I was a child I took part in a lot of sponsored walks. Each year my school would organise the walks and although it wasn’t compulsory my friends and I would always take part. It was fun. Each walk was about 15 km long so it took quite a long time but it was a nice way to spend a day. The first year I did it I was only 11 years old and my father came with us to keep an eye on us but once we were older we went by ourselves; there were about 8 or 9 of us that all walked together. We managed to get quite a bit of money between us; in fact it became our challenge to raise more money than the year before, which we always achieved, so there was a great sense of satisfaction. Retired primary school head teacher We used to make a big effort to get the children involved in charity events as I think it helps raise their awareness of world events and the fact that in many places there are people, particularly children like themselves, who live in very different circumstances to them. I think they get a great sense of satisfaction too from knowing that they are able to do something to help. Each year we had a mufti day; where all the children paid a small amount of money and then came to school for one day in their own clothes and not in school uniform. We also regularly held school fetes where the children were encouraged to donate old toys and books and things which we then sold. The children got involved in running the stalls too and all the money we made went to our chosen charity. Environmental consultant I cycled from L.A. to Quito last spring. All my family thought I was mad but I love cycling and I knew it would be an amazing way to see lots of really interesting places that most people never see. I managed to raise quite a bit of money for charity through sponsorship although that wasn't my main objective. I turned 30 in March and I really wanted to be doing something totally different rather than just sitting at my desk in the office. I wanted it to be different and something I could look back on when I am older and feel proud of. It is something I’ll be able to tell my grandchildren about and the fact that I was able to do something to help those less well off than me at the same time, well that made it even better."

    "text": "Being a Good Manager Being a good manager of people requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. All people are different and in a working environment there will always be a great mix of personalities and skills. I 9 I Like with everything in life though, experience brings knowledge and in my many years as both an employee and a manager in various charity organisations I have come to recognise the qualities and skills which make an efficient manager. I’ve worked with lots of different people in the past and I think I have experienced all sorts of different types of manager. There are those who are very controlling and always telling you what to do while at the other extreme there are others who are nowhere to be seen. I 10 I I think it’s important to let people work on their own and not interfere too much; ideally you want to promote assertiveness and self-confidence in your workers’ and if you are always watching over them and checking up on them they will not develop these skills. At the same time it is not helpful to leave your workers completely alone. The manager is there to oversee things and make sure everything runs smoothly, if employees have a problem or need help they should always be able to ask for it, and the manager should be able to provide it. A line manager who is not available to staff when they need them is of no use at all. To be an effective manager I think it is important to be optimistic and able to instil a positive attitude in the workforce; the worst kind of manager is one who allows or even encourages a bad feeling in the workplace. I 11 I As a result we all lacked confidence in the whole organisation and the office became a very negative environment to work in. It’s a manager’s responsibility to keep workers spirits high and create a pleasant atmosphere. Having a naturally optimistic and friendly personality helps. The best types of managers are those who can accept the responsibility they have been given. If something goes wrong a good manager will take the blame; they are responsible for the team and if the team, or any individual within it, is not performing well then it is ultimately the manager’s fault. I 12 I They must also then do all they can to solve any unsatisfactory situations and deal with dissatisfaction from higher up in the organisation on the team’s behalf. One thing which managers often do not do enough is give praise. Praise is a very effective management tool and should be exploited as much as possible. I 13 I Managers who give a lot of praise are also in a much better situation to criticise when work is not of a satisfactory standard. It is important that employees receive positive as well as negative feedback on their performance; the more feedback there is the more aware workers will be of what is expected of them and positive feedback helps increase motivation. Connected to this last point is the ability to judge on merit. Managers must be able to separate their personal feelings for individuals from their assessment of their work. It is really important to see team members’ actions objectively. Any feelings of favouritism or discrimination can be very harmful to the team. Managers need to be able to recognise the strengths and weaknesses of their employees and use them appropriately. This includes recognising their own strengths and weaknesses. I 14 I Managers need to be flexible in their approach to assigning work so that tasks are assigned to those best suited to doing them. I have worked for an organisation where work was given to individuals based on the time of the day they were available to work rather than their personal expertise; this not only resulted in the jobs not being done well and therefore reduced efficiency, but also great dissatisfaction among workers and clients. For example, someone with excellent computer skills but poor public speaking skills should not be asked to go into schools and universities to give presentations. At the same time it is essential to share knowledge and experience so that the team as a whole develop existing skills and individuals learn new ones. I 15 I As the manager learns new skills and gains useful information it is important that they share it with the team. The manager should not be doing tasks which could be done equally well by someone less qualified than themselves. Where possible managers should delegate and occupy themselves with higher level activities. However, it is also important that in times of crisis or when the team is exceptionally busy, the manager should not feel themselves too important to join in and do whatever job is necessary to help the situation. Finally, empathy is an enormously important quality when working as a manager of people. The basic rule of ‘treat others as you would expect others to treat you’ is fundamental. It’s important to try to put yourself in your colleagues’ situation and try and appreciate how they are feeling and then act accordingly. A This includes the manager passing on what they know. B They should never promise anything that is not possible as this will lead to disappointment and undermine confidence in the company. C Now that I work as a manager myself I try to be neither too controlling nor too distant. D Efficiently managing a team of people is no easy task and there will be many challenging moments. E In the past I have worked in an office where my line manager was constantly complaining about and criticising the directors of the company. F Managers should look for examples of good work and congratulate workers accordingly. G Managers choose and develop their team and so must accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good results of their efforts. H An efficient team makes the most of all the skills different individuals bring to it."

When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: has been a teacher the longest? |16| no longer works as a teacher? |17| has taught in many different countries? |18| mentions the qualities which are important to be a good teacher? |19| says they became a teacher because they were not happy in their previous job? |20| says they like working as a teacher because their job is always interesting? |21| |22| mentions a difficulty of their subject? |23| says they have had a number of different jobs? |24| says they were keen to share what they have learnt with others? |25| says that they had been interested in teaching from a young age? |26| says it’s easy for pupils to see the results of their work in her subject? |27| say they have taught adults as well as children and teenagers? |28| has helped and trained other teachers? |29| says the beginning of their career as a teacher was hard work? |30| A Career in Teaching A Anna I first got into teaching 4 years ago when I decided to quit my office job and do a bit of travelling. I’d heard of the CELTA qualification to teach English to adults and thought it would be a great way to see the world. I’d also been interested in teaching since I was at school and with the CELTA thought it would be a perfect combination - teaching and travel. Since completing the course I’ve spent time teaching in the UK, Austria, Poland and Spain and have loved every minute. I’ve taught people of all ages and levels. I’d say the main thing I enjoy about teaching is the fact that you’re able to engage with people from different countries, all of whom have different backgrounds and experiences, and I feel that this therefore makes teaching an interesting, varied profession. I think the thing I found the most frustrating was probably going into different schools and trying to teach children and teenagers who were not interested in learning English and only there because their parents had made them. However, this meant there was always a challenge in trying to find material that these students would be interested in and a job where you don’t have challenges I imagine would be rather boring. I’ve recently started working as a primary school teacher, which I’m really enjoying. I look back on my time teaching abroad with a lot of fondness and for this reason it is something I would definitely like to do again in the future. C Sally I have been teaching for 3 years now and decided to train to be a food technology teacher after working in the food industry for 5 years. I was fed up with working long hours, knowing the end result was making profit for the company I was working for at the time rather than giving me satisfaction. I have also always loved my subject - Home Economics, Food technology and Cookery - and wanted the opportunity to use my experience and knowledge to inspire and help others. Friends had put me off going into teaching previously due to the notorious heavy workload. It has been the most rewarding and challenging job of my career and I now couldn’t imagine doing anything else. I am lucky with my subject because progress and success are instant in practical cookery lessons; giving plenty of opportunity to praise pupils and raise their confidence. There have been very difficult times in my teaching career, especially the first year, when learning the work life balance was impossible to grasp; this in conjunction with challenging behaviour issues was a steep learning curve, but I am pleased I persevered. Over time teaching got easier and I think it is the most fulfilling, satisfying profession I could do. The odd pupil that walks out of the class and says ‘thanks for a great lesson, Miss’ or the look on a pupil’s face when his bread comes out the oven, makes the hard work worthwhile. B Valerie I love teaching because it is never boring. I have been a teacher for over twenty years and I still enjoy my day to day work. I teach Science to students aged eleven to sixteen. This sometimes involves explaining difficult concepts and examining ethical questions which some students find very difficult. It is very stimulating working with young people and their enthusiasm and optimism can be quite infectious. To be a good teacher you need to be very knowledgeable about your subject. You must have a good sense of humour and be fair and consistent in your dealings with other people, but most of all you must be a good communicator. There are lots of teachers who know their subject very well but unless you can enthuse your students and build their confidence and self-esteem you will never be an inspirational teacher. D Joanna After studying languages at university, I was unsure what I wanted to do for a living. I worked for a year in a nursery school and, in my spare time, volunteered for a charity that sends people on projects in developing countries. I put together a programme of induction for the volunteers, to prepare them for going on their projects. I soon decided that I would like to do this as a full-time job, but I needed to get a qualification in education and some more experience. I took a postgraduate teacher training course and worked for three years teaching languages in a secondary school. During that time, I got very involved in global education - teaching school children about global issues and how they affect people in developing countries. After three years of teaching, I got a job managing a global education centre. I co-ordinated and contributed to a programme of workshops for children and training for teachers. A further three years later, the charity I had volunteered for could afford to give me a full-time job, and I’ve been working there for two years now."

She was just deciding in which direction she should walk when Mr Rodgers came into the room and walked straight towards her. There was no way she could avoid him; he had clearly seen her and she still had a cup of tea in front of her ready to drink. ‘Do you mind if I sit down?’ he asked politely. Of course she couldn't refuse; it wasn’t in her nature to be rude. ‘Yes, please do,’ she said and offered him some tea. He accepted but then didn’t seem to be paying attention when she asked him if he’d like milk and sugar. In fact he seemed very distracted. Suddenly he got up and started pacing up and down in front of the table. This was really quite annoying as he was walking right in front of the window and getting in the way of the nice view. ‘I’ve got a problem,’ he said, ‘and I was hoping you might be able to help me with it.’ ‘Oh!’ she replied. She hadn’t expected him to be so familiar; they had only known each other a few weeks and they were not really friends. ‘Well, I’ll try,’ she said. ‘I'd be happy to help in any way I can. ‘It all started last week,’ he began. ‘I was on my way to the shops when I bumped into Veronica Gray. We stopped and had a chat for a couple of minutes, you know about the weather, and then just as I was making my excuses and saying goodbye her husband came round the corner. He looked very serious and not at all happy to find us chatting together. Veronica suddenly went very quiet and almost ran away in the opposite direction. Her husband walked past me, barely said hello, and followed his wife round the corner. I was very confused by the whole thing. One minute she’d been happily gossiping and then as soon as Gregory appeared she became a different person. And he, well, for a second I thought he might hit me.’ I didn’t see either of them again until last night, here in the hotel. I was coming down to dinner when I heard voices on the stairs below me. I didn’t recognise who it was but as I walked round the corner I saw it was Veronica and Gregory and they were clearly arguing. It was too late for me turn back, they had already seen me, so I said good evening and carried on downstairs as quickly as I could. But Gregory called me back. He was quite angry and started shouting at me; he said I should mind my own business and leave his wife alone. Veronica was crying and tried to tell her husband to leave me alone, that it wasn’t my fault and so on. It was very unpleasant and I really had no idea what was going on. I said I had no idea what he was talking about and to be honest I might have just put it down to him being a bit jealous and left it at that except that at that moment Annabel came down the stairs and saw us. I don’t know if you know but she and I are engaged.’ ‘Yes, I did know; congratulations.’ And of course it didn’t look good, having Gregory more or less accuse me of having some sort of affair with his wife. Annabel just looked at me and walked off. Now she won’t speak to me. What do you think I should do? Should I confront Gregory and make him see sense? Or should I try and find out from Veronica what is going on? There’s obviously something not right between them; I just don’t understand how I got involved. I’d really appreciate any help you can give me.’ ‘Well, I think the first thing you need to do is speak to Annabel and make sure she sees that this is just a misunderstanding.’ ‘I’ve tried that,’ he explained, ‘but she won’t speak to me; she doesn’t answer the phone when I call her.’ He looked desperate. ‘OK,’ she said gently, ‘why don’t I go and speak to Annabel, and tell her about this conversation we’ve just had?’ ‘Would you? Oh, thank you, I’d be so grateful.’ She left him sitting at the table looking much happier already. And she knew just where to find Annabel. At this time of day she was always in the garden reading. 1 How did Miss Johnson react when she saw Mr Rodgers come into the dining room? A She was pleased to see him. B She avoided him.

    "text": "You are going to read an interview in which a woman talks about her experience of being on a reality TV show. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. What show did you go on and why? The TV show I went on involved holding a dinner party for 4 people I’d never met before. There were 5 of us and we held a dinner party in each of our houses on consecutive nights, so we had 5 dinner parties in one week. It was exhausting but a lot of fun. It’s a competition where you can actually win quite a lot of money and there is quite a competitive atmosphere. At the end of each evening you have to give a score for the evening and the person with the highest score at the end of the week wins. I didn’t win unfortunately but that wasn’t my only reason for going on it, although of course it would have been nice. I 9 I I watch it every week and I wanted to be on it myself just to see what it would be like to be on the other side of the camera. I thought it would be fun and I knew I could do it better or at least as well as most of the people I’d watched. I 10 I For me it was much more about the food and trying to impress with my cooking skills than just getting on TV. Was the experience what you expected? It was actually very different from what I had expected. I hadn’t realised what it would be like to have a camera crew with me while I was preparing everything and how much they wanted to see of my house. It felt strange but they were very nice and friendly and made me feel comfortable. In fact they really made me laugh while I was trying to cook and be all serious. I 11 I I knew they would be with me all the day I was hosting the meal but they wanted to see me every other day as well and ask me lots of questions on camera about the other people and what I thought of their food. The other people were the biggest surprise; I know seeing how we all get on and the different relationships that form is a big part of the show but I was still surprised by the other individuals who had been chosen to take part. I 12 I What shocked me was how critical everyone was. I’m quite a polite person and very optimistic so I always try and find the best of a situation. The first night was a bit of disaster as the host got really behind on the timing and we had to wait ages for the main course and then when it came out it wasn’t cooked properly. I tried to compliment her on the vegetables and the presentation and told her how wonderful the starter was but the others were just saying things like ‘I’m sorry, I really can’t eat this,’ and ‘Well, it’s OK, but it isn’t that great, is it?’ The poor woman was nearly in tears. Fortunately my evening went well and although I’m sure they had plenty of criticisms to make they did it behind my back rather than to my face so there was a much pleasanter atmosphere. What did it feel like when you watched the programme on TV? It was really strange to see myself on TV but it was fascinating seeing how they had edited everything and put it all together. I 13 I I watched it with a big group of friends and I kept wanting to tell them about all the bits that had been cut out. In a way the programme doesn’t give a realistic portrayal of what really happened as they tend to choose the most shocking and embarrassing parts to put in but I guess that’s what makes good television; it has to be entertaining. Would you say it was a positive experience? It was definitely good fun and yes I think it was positive. I 14 I I felt under an enormous amount of pressure the whole week knowing that the camera was watching my every move. The day I had to cook I felt very nervous and stressed, it’s bad enough entertaining but when you know you’re being filmed it’s a hundred times worse. But at the end of the evening I felt a great sense of achievement. Nothing awful happened and I think they liked my food and I was able to relax a bit more after my evening. I 15 I I always feel sorry for the people who have to go first because as well as doing all the cooking you have to worry about introducing everyone and you have no idea what to expect. Overall I came second so I didn’t win the money but felt that was quite respectable. I feel more confident cooking for other people now and I still watch the programme and enjoy it too! A They must have had about 6 or 7 hours of footage from each of the 5 days and yet all you see is about 25 minutes. B I'm glad I did it even though I didn’t love every minute of it. C Everyone else made really interesting dishes and we all got on really well. D There were a real mix of personalities and there was one person in particular I am very happy I’ll never have to see again. E I’m not really an exhibitionist so I would never go on a show like Big Brother but with this there was a point to it; it wasn’t just about people watching us do very ordinary everyday things. F I was also surprised by how much time they wanted to be with me. G I did it because I love cooking and entertaining and I’m a huge fan of the show. H I went second which was much better than going first as I had at least met all the other people before they arrived on my doorstep."

When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. According to the text which beach or beaches: are close to big cities? 16 | 17 | is just one of many attractive beaches in the area? 18 | was popular with the country’s royal family in the past? 19 | has hosted a lot of music events? 20 | has needed to have sand imported from other beaches? 21 | has won an award for natural beauty? 22 | is well connected by public transport? 23 | have held a world sports event? 24 | 25 | sometimes has marine animals passing through the area? 26 | attracts a lot of foreigners at Christmas? 27 | has been used in a lot of publicity material? 28 | have separate areas for swimming and surfing? 29 | 30 Famous Beaches Waikiki Beach, Hawaii Waikiki Beach is located on the southern side of the island of Honolulu. Its name comes from the Hawaiian language and means sprouting fresh water. The beach is very popular because of the warm climate, clear blue skies and beautiful views, as well as the good surf. On windy days the waves can be strong and the beach’s long rolling break makes it ideal for all types of surfing. Half of the beach is sectioned off for surfing with the other half left for swimming. The shore line now has a number of tall buildings and hotel resorts. The first hotels opened in the 1880s and from the 1890s the resort grew in popularity with tourists from the mainland, although the area had been a retreat for the Hawaiian royal family for many decades before that. The beach hosts many events each year including surfing competitions, outrigger canoe races, hula dancing, and in recent years free movies projected onto an enormous outdoor screen. Over time the beach has suffered from erosion and there have been a number of projects to try to protect the beach and replenish lost sand. At one time sand was shipped over from California although from the 1970s projects have focused on reducing further loss and sustaining the existing sand. Copacabana Beach, Brazil Copacabana beach gets its name from the area of Rio de Janeiro in which it is situated. The borough of Copacabana is to the south of the city and is world famous because of the beach. The beach is 4 kilometres long and has historic forts at either end. The beach has been the site for all sorts of outdoor events; it has hosted the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup many times and in recent years has been the venue for huge free concerts. It is also where millions of people go every year to celebrate on New Year’s Eve. When it was announced that Rio de Janeiro would be hosting the 2016 Olympics locals congregated on the beach to celebrate. There are many hotels, hostels, bars, nightclubs and restaurants along the promenade and the promenade is itself a work of art; a 4 kilometre-long pavement landscape of Portuguese design. Copacabana is well linked to the rest of the city; it has 3 metro stations and numerous bus services as well as 3 major roads. Bondi Beach, Australia Bondi beach is a well-known and popular beach; it is also the name of the suburb where it is situated to the east of Sydney. It is just 7 kilometres from the Sydney central business district. Its name comes from the Aboriginal word meaning water breaking over rocks. Bondi beach became increasingly popular during the middle of the nineteenth century and was declared a public beach in 1882. It remains popular with locals and visitors and is particularly popular with British and Irish tourists on Christmas day. The beach is about one kilometre long. Areas safe for swimming are shown by red and yellow flags and the southern end is generally reserved for surfing. In addition to the underwater currents a further danger comes from the sun. Despite official warnings about the need to use sun protection in Australia there are no sun umbrellas on Bondi beach. Sharks, however, do not present much of a risk as the beach is protected by an underwater shark net during the summer. During their months of migration it is possible to see whales and dolphins in the area and very occasionally penguins. The beach regularly hosts many public events including a short film festival and a sculpture exhibition. During the 2000 Sydney Olympics the beach was the site for the beach volleyball competition. Praia da Marinha, Portugal Praia de Marinha, beach of the Navy in English, is one of the more well-known of many spectacular beaches in the Algarve, the southern coastal area of Portugal. It’s famous for its stunning cliffs and clear clean water. It has been used in many advertising campaigns and in promotional material for Portugal. In 1998 the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment awarded it the Golden Beach award for its outstanding natural qualities. There are many other beautiful beaches along the same stretch of coast; the south facing coastline of the Algarve is over 150 kilometres long. The Algarve has been popular with tourists for many decades, particularly those from Northern Europe. In addition to well-known natural beauty spots, nice beaches and a warm mild climate, tourists are attracted by the growing number of high quality golf courses. Tourism is now the most important economic activity in the area."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a successful novelist. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (А, В, С or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Darren Bell is a well-known household name and has had three best-sellers. I met him to find out what his secret was. He writes in such a natural, easy-going style I wasn't surprised when he told me he had been writing stories from a very young age. I’ve always enjoyed writing; I used to write short stories when I was at school and really enjoyed the opportunity to be creative and let my imagination run wild. When I asked how his family and friends reacted to his creative writing he explained that it was largely thanks to their positive feedback that he had pursued a career as a writer. He said his teachers and parents always encouraged him to write and to enter competitions; he won his first writing competition at school when he was just 7 years old, My story was printed in the local newspaper, it was really exciting and my Mum still has a copy of the paper somewhere. Did you ever feel very different from your school friends? I asked him. Not at all, he said. We did all the normal things like watch football together, go out on our bikes and so on. The only difference was that I would be more likely to have a notebook in my bag and might sometimes write ideas down, but my friends were used to that, it didn’t feel strange and no-one ever said anything about it. I asked how his passion for writing developed as he got older and how he found his particular fictional style. He explained that when he went to university he got involved in writing for the university newspaper. He told me he wrote all sorts of different articles but at the end of the day after trying all sorts of different writing types he decided he preferred writing fiction rather than serious articles about news events. As it is now, it was always the sense of getting completely lost in my own world that attracted me. I like being creative and I feel more comfortable expressing my own ideas and images rather than writing about things that are real. He explained this further by saying that when you write about true facts you have to justify everything and get things right but when he was writing his own stories he felt like he could write about anything he liked. That’s not to say you don't have to do a lot of research, he pointed out. He told me he had spent hours in libraries and museums looking up all sorts of things from chemical equations to dinosaurs and that the best source of information was talking to experts and people who had really experienced the sorts of things he wanted the characters in his books to experience. He says it’s important to make the events and characters seem believable otherwise people won’t connect with the story. I always make an effort to research my subject matter properly as there will always be someone out there who really does know about whatever I’m talking about and I don’t want anybody to read my books and think I'm talking nonsense. I asked him where he got his inspiration from for his unusual storylines and he openly admitted that it was very boring everyday events. When I write I start by thinking of a real situation and real people and then imagine what they might do if something unexpected or unusual happened. I like to write about how different people react and how this affects their relationships with one another. He added that one thing that he always tried to ensure was that his stories had a clear and satisfying ending. I don’t like to leave any loose ends, he said. I myself find it frustrating if at the end of a book something is not explained, so I try and avoid this frustration for my readers. He also says he tries to give his novels happy endings. That’s not to say sad things don’t happen in my novels because they do and any story where everyone is happy and only good things happen would be very unrealistic, but I don’t want readers to finish my novels feeling depressed, so I like to finish on a positive note. And finally what is his key to success? According to Darren the most important thing is to have a great team of friends and family behind you to help you and support you. I am lucky to have a very supportive and understanding family and numerous friends, who have been fantastic and helped by reading endless drafts of my work and giving very honest comments on it. I couldn’t have done any of it without them. 1 Why was the interviewer not surprised that Darren had been writing since a young age? A Because he writes like a trained professional. B Because he has a very relaxed way of writing. C Because he is well-known for the stories he wrote as a child. D Because his stories are very creative. 2 How did he feel when he won his first writing competition? A embarrassed B different from his friends C excited D he was too young to feel anything 3 When he says ‘my friends were used to that’ in line 13, what does ‘that’ refer to? A watching football and going for bike rides together B Darren winning competitions C carrying notebooks in their bags D Darren writing things down in his notebook 4 Why does he say he prefers writing creative fiction to writing about real news events?

    "text": "You are going to read an article in which a young man who lives in London explains why cycling is by the far the best way to get around in a big city. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Why I cycle in the city I cycle because it is cheaper, quicker, more reliable, it is better for the environment and it is better for me; both mentally and physically. Public transport is so expensive and so unreliable these days I try to use it as little as possible. On the underground and trains there are always delays, planned and unplanned closures and you can wait half an hour for a bus to then sit in a traffic jam. I 9 I Public transport can be so uncomfortable too; it gets so crowded in the rush hour with hundreds of people all crammed into a tiny space. This makes it a stressful and unpleasant beginning or end to everyone’s day. No one looks at anyone else, even though you are only centimetres away from each other and all social graces go out the window. I much prefer to be on my bike. I know how long it will take me to get where I am going and I am outside in the fresh air. I 10 I The one thing I used to like about travelling by train was reading the free paper or a good book but sometimes it is so busy you don’t have enough space to do that. It is true that at less busy times of the day public transport isn’t such a bad way to get around, except that at times of the day when fewer people want to use trains and buses there are, logically, fewer of them. In my experience an off-peak journey might be cheaper and pleasanter in the sense that you can sit down, read a book and generally not have your personal space invaded, but your journey will take longer as you’ll have to wait longer for connections. The other alternative would be to travel by car but again there are all sorts of reasons why the bike is a hundred times better. I 11 I Firstly, travelling by car is extremely expensive, something which in the future will only get worse as fuel prices continue to rise and parking restrictions increase. And while you don’t have to deal with impatient and stressed passengers pushing you off trains or buses you have to suffer impatient and stressed drivers next to you and behind you in heavy traffic. I 12 I If there are hold ups because of traffic problems or an accident, we cyclists can just keep on going while cars have to sit and wait; how often do you hear someone apologising for being late because they were ‘stuck in traffic’? Often. A further disadvantage is the difficulty of parking; there is never a free parking space at the end of the day in the street so unless you want to drive around for hours looking for a space the only option is to have a garage; an additional cost. In the city centre the few public car parks which exist are unbelievably expensive. I can leave my bike more or less anywhere and don’t have to pay a penny. I 13 I Finally and by no means the least important problem with travelling by car is that it is extremely harmful to the environment. If more people left their cars at home or car-shared we could reduce our carbon emissions significantly. There are of course also some drawbacks to cycling. I 14 I There is no denying it really is unpleasant cycling in the rain. However, it is also not nice to be on the bus or train or driving a car in the rain. Safety of course is an issue too, although in recent years a lot more cycle lanes have been put in place and I think drivers are more aware of cyclists now than they used to be. Another thing is that when you cycle you have to carry a change of clothes with you which can be inconvenient but I have got used to it and now I actually like arriving at work and changing into clean, dry things. I 15 I At the end of a long busy day it sometimes just seems too much energy to get on my bike and cycle for forty minutes but once I get going I always feel much better for the physical exercise. For me there is no contest, cycling is simply the best way to get around. Walking is the only other way I would contemplate getting around in the city, but of course that is really only possible for short distances. A Cycling at quiet times of the day means you can get where you want to be in even less time. B Even on a good day my journey by underground, train or bus would take me longer than cycling and my bike takes me all the way to where I want to go. C The bad weather is probably the worst. D The only other negative point is that it can be tiring. E Also cyclists are, on the whole, nice to each other unlike fellow commuters on the train or bus. F A journey by car to work in the morning can be a very exhausting experience. G When I get home I can literally just pick it up and bring it inside with me. H Of course in a car you have your own space and don’t have the same pressures as on public transport but there are other problems to deal with."

I love being indoors and hearing the rain outside and watching it through the window. I even enjoy walking in the rain, but there was one time when I very nearly got swept away by the rain. It was what is called a flash flood. It had been raining hard all day and I was on my way home from work on my bike. There’s a river near my house and it had been in danger of flooding for a number of days. Sandbags had been put in place to build up a protective barrier and prevent it from breaking its banks, however, it wasn’t enough. The water level reached a point where it simply overflowed and in a matter of seconds the country lane I was cycling along became a small river of fast-running water. I was dragged off my bike by the water and pulled about 10 metres down the road. I managed to grab onto the branch of a tree and get myself out of the water. My bike was not so lucky and it disappeared from sight. B Jada in St Lucia I don’t like the wind: it reminds me of when I was in a hurricane on holiday one year. I was only young and on holiday with my parents and it was the middle of summer. We'd been on the beach all day in glorious sunshine when suddenly the sky began to get very dark. Lots of people started leaving the beach and told us we should do the same. No one seemed to be panicking but there was definitely a sense of urgency. When we got back to the hotel they told us it would be better to stay downstairs in the lounge room and that if we had to go to our rooms we should not go anywhere near the balcony and keep all the doors and windows shut. So we stayed in the hotel restaurant and listened to the wind and the rain outside. We couldn’t see anything because all the shutters were closed. The most frightening thing was looking outside in the morning after the storm had passed. The hotel garden was devastated; two small trees had been knocked down and many others had branches broken off. It was terrible. C Lauren in Sydney The strangest thing I’ve ever seen is a dust storm. I woke up and looked outside and everything was red. It was really weird; there was an eerie orange fog, just like something out of a science fiction film about an alien invasion or something. I was quite scared being on my own and turned the TV on to find out what was going on and that’s when I found it was a dust storm and not the end of the world. I felt calmer after that. Apparently it was caused by a combination of very dry weather and strong winds. They were recommending people stay inside as there had been reports of people suffering breathing problems but I had to go to work so I just wrapped a scarf around my face and went out in it. It didn’t last long and started to clear by the middle of the afternoon but it caused a lot of disruption; they had to cancel lots of flights and ferries. D Daniel in Tunisia The weather I really like is when it’s warm and sunny; a perfect summers’ day. Sitting in the garden in the sunshine makes me very happy. However, the sun in the Sahara Desert is a whole different matter. I was on holiday with friends in Tunisia and as part of our tour we were taken on a camel ride through the desert. I don’t think it was a terribly well organised tour as we ended up in the desert at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, almost the hottest time of the day. We were given plenty of protective clothing and we were only in the desert for about 40 minutes but even then you get quite a good sense of just how hot and barren it can be in the desert. The dunes look endless and there is absolutely nothing in sight except sand and sky and the heat is very intense: there is no escape from it. E Ryan in New York I love the winter, blue skies and really cold temperatures and snow. I love going for walks in the cold weather but one year on holiday in New York I had quite a frightening experience in the snow. My girlfriend and I were on holiday and when it started snowing we thought it was wonderful. We were quite a long way from our hotel and being young and naive we thought it would be fun to walk in the snow. We weren’t very well-dressed for the weather and had completely under-estimated how much it was going to snow. Within about ten minutes we could no longer see where we were going and it was impossible to tell where the road was. It was dangerous. It was a proper blizzard and very disorientating. All we could see was white. We got back to the hotel eventually but if I found myself in a situation like that again I think I would be much more sensible: I’d stay in the warm until the snow had passed."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a keen and well-respected gardener. For questions 1-8 choose the answer (А, В, С or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. When did you first become interested in gardening? I started gardening at the age of 5; my mother gave each of us, my older sister and brother and me, a section of the garden which was ours to look after. I used to save my pocket money to buy seeds and bulbs and things to plant in my little patch and was really excited to watch the things I planted begin to grow. My brother and sister were never very interested and my mother used to do what needed to be done in the garden to keep it looking nice but it was really only me who had a real passion for gardening. I was quite unique in my family in that respect. I used to go out to the woods and countryside near where I lived and collect wild flowers when I was a child. Then when I got home I would look up in books the names of the flowers I had found and press them and keep. On a good day I would find about twenty new flowers. At school I chose to study science and botany right up to the age of 18 and learnt a lot about plants. And what do you like about gardening now? I love being outside in the fresh air and seeing things develop and grow. I like planning in the autumn for the next year and imagining how it will look in the spring and summer. You never really know how it will turn out in the end and when it works out well it is very satisfying. In that way gardening can be very rewarding. It can also be very challenging. You need to learn about different soil types and which plants grow best in which places. It is also important to know how big plants will grow and how quickly. And you have to consider which plants will go together with others. You have to be very patient to be a good gardener as you always have to wait a long time to see the results of your ideas and hard work. You usually have to wait months to see if something works or not. But in the summer there is nothing I like more than being outside in my garden with the beautiful flowers and their lovely smells and scents. Are there any negative points? It can be very physically demanding and there are times when the weather means you can’t get outside and do things, which can be very frustrating. The winter months are obviously more difficult than other times of the year as there is still work to be done but not so much to enjoy, and working outside in winter is not as pleasant as at other times of the year. Have you ever grown fruit and vegetables? Yes, I have grown quite a lot of fruit and vegetables in the past. My husband and I love cooking and it is great to cook with home grown fruit and vegetables. More than anything else we use all our own herbs from the garden when we’re cooking. It’s wonderful to be able to go out and pick things like parsley, mint, coriander or rosemary from the garden for dishes we’re making; it is the ultimate in fresh ingredients. For that reason I have always had a herb garden. Most herbs have flowers so they look pretty in the garden and they smell nice too. They are also quite easy to grow and don’t take up much space so you can grow them even if you have a small garden. Have you ever won any prizes for your plants or flowers? We live in a small village in the countryside and each year there is a flower show which I have taken part in. I’ve won a couple of times but I am not that interested in competitions. I don’t think growing plants and flowers should be competitive. I enter the flower show each year because I want to support the village, and the spring flower show is a long established tradition which I think it is important to maintain. What advice would you give someone who wants to start gardening? Don’t be too ambitious. I would say you should start with well-known plants that are easy to grow, and have a look at what grows in other gardens near you to get an idea of what sorts of plants suit the area you are in. The main thing is not to be impatient. You need to realise that it takes a long time to see the fulfilment of your work. 1 Why does she say she was quite unique in her family?

    "text": "You are going to read an article about learning a second language. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. How to be a better second language learner There is a lot of evidence which suggests that it is better to learn a second language when you are still young, ideally before the age of 11, and that once you are a teenager it is more difficult to learn a foreign language. This might be true but there are plenty of examples of adults who have started to learn a second language later in life and still managed to achieve a very good level. There are lots of factors involved in how well people are able to learn and use a second (or third or fourth) language and age is only one of them. I 9 I Here are some tips which might help you: Firstly you are likely to learn a language more quickly the more exposure you have to it. It therefore makes sense to try to spend time in a country where the language is spoken. You do not necessarily have to go and live in the country long term but try to make frequent visits so that you often have to use the language for genuine communication and see and hear the language all around you. It is important that even if your visits are short they are frequent so that you do not forget everything you have learnt in between one trip and the next. I 10 I If you go with friends who speak your language it is unlikely you will have much need to use the language you are trying to learn. Probably the best thing to do is to go alone and enrol on a language course so that you will have some instruction and help with the language from a teacher and you will also meet other people in a similar situation to yourself. Of course this might not be possible, it might be too far away or too expensive. Don’t worry, even if you stay in your own country and learn another language there are still things you can do to make the experience more effective. It is possible to try to teach yourself; you can buy some books, borrow material from a library or follow an online course but the best thing to do is sign up to have language classes with a qualified teacher. It is more fun to attend classes with other people and you can often help each other and learn things from other students so you are likely to make more rapid progress than if you try to study on your own. I 11 I In addition, you want a teacher who will give you homework and correct it for you and guide you in what other things you can be doing outside of class by yourself. One thing you should definitely try to do is read in the language you are studying as reading is the best way to increase your vocabulary. I 12 I When you are reading you will probably come across language you are already familiar with in new and different contexts. This helps to broaden your knowledge. For example, you might see verbs you already know in different forms. It doesn’t matter what you read, and the best advice is to read something that you would read in your own language. Reading in a foreign language can be difficult, so it is important that you choose something you are interested in and would enjoy in your own language. You can even read a book you have already read in your own language. When you come across new words or expressions try to guess their meaning rather than looking them up in a dictionary. It is not usually necessary to understand every single word. I 13 I That way you won’t interrupt the flow of your reading. When you come to recording new words or expressions either in class or from reading it is really important to write whole sentences and use meaningful examples. I 14 I A big problem when you try to use the language you are learning is inaccurate translation. You shouldn’t try to construct sentences and phrases the same way you do in your first language as this often results in something that sounds strange or even something that makes no sense at all. The best way to avoid this is to learn whole expressions and sentences and not to focus too much on individual words. If possible, you should try to listen to the language too. You can do this by listening to the radio or watching TV. I 15 I Short episodes of television series are better than films as films can be very long and the language is often very colloquial and informal. And finally, ideally you should practice speaking and communicating in the language with someone who knows the language better than you. This doesn’t need to be a native speaker but should be someone who can correct you and help you with things you don’t know. A And you need a teacher to explain things to you and more importantly to correct you if you make any mistakes. В Like with reading try to choose things you are interested in already and would listen to or watch in your own language. С Another point to consider is how you spend your time while you are there. D This means you are more likely to want to finish it and keep going when it gets difficult. E Try to write things which are real and true for you as this will make it easier to remember. F It is also a good way of reinforcing the grammatical structures you already know. G So the good news is that if you are learning a language as a teenager or adult there is no reason why you should not reach a good level if you really want to. H If you really want to check the meaning of something underline it and come back to it later"

    "text": "In today’s world protecting the environment and sustainability are very important issues. Cities and councils throughout the world are working hard to improve the current situation and sustainability will be an important factor in all town and city development in the future. One city which has always had the environment as its top priority is the Brazilian city of Curtiba. It is in the south of the country and is one of the most innovative cities in the world. It is so environmentally-friendly it is known as the ecological capital of Brazil. It is such a successful example of sustainable development that it is visited by delegates from all over the world. The people in Curtiba are very proud of their city and not only believe in a greener lifestyle but they really live it. Sustainable development is evident in all aspects of city life. Residents have planted 1.6 million trees and over 70% of all waste is recycled. Curtiba has the highest rate of paper and glass recycling of anywhere in Brazil. Paper recycling in Curtiba saves over 1,000 trees a year. Like many cities in the world Curtiba also faces many socio-economic problems but because it is such a unique and forward thinking city the residents came up with a revolutionary idea to help poor families and reduce waste at the same time. Each family sorts its rubbish and then it is weighed and ‘sold’ back to the city council in exchange for fruit and meat. This provides healthy food for those who can’t afford it and also encourages recycling and helps keep the city clean and tidy. Rubbish which cannot be recycled is burnt to make electricity. The city’s public transport is also one of the greenest in the world. The bus service is cheap and efficient and saves millions of car journeys each year as you can use the buses to get anywhere in the city. There are over 70 kilometres of bus only routes through the city. Roads have 4 lanes, 2 for cars and lorries and 2 for buses only. This means buses can run freely through the city without getting stuck in traffic jams. As a result millions of people use the bus every day rather than their cars. There are also special bus lines for students, the disabled and tourists. The best thing, though, is that the 1,200 buses which make up the network run on biodiesel; that is fuel made from plants like soya. Reduced car traffic and low consumption of traditional fuels means that Curtiba is one of the least polluted cities in Brazil. Curtiba was one of the first cities in the world to have completely car free areas in the city centre. Also their bus stops have been carefully designed so that they are level with the buses. They are tube shaped and have ramps to provide easy access for everyone. Curtiba has grown dramatically over the years. In 1950 300,000 people lived there, now the population is 1.8 million. However, even from the beginning the needs of the city had to be balanced with the needs of the environment. Fortunately this has had great economic benefits for the economy. Income per capita is 60% higher than the national average. The architect who led the city’s growth in the 1960s was so popular he later became the city’s mayor. One big challenge that the city has faced throughout its development is flooding. The city has had to find ways to protect itself from flooding which has affected the city centre for many years. Curtiba wanted to find a solution which worked with nature. The solution they came up with involved creating a number of lakes in the city’s parks which could hold flood water. Also no buildings were allowed to be built in areas which had a risk of flooding. One of the most beautiful buildings in the city is the university. It is called the free university of environment and was built using reclaimed eucalyptus poles. You can study a wide range of subjects there although of course it offers many different environmental courses, including bio-architecture. 1 Why is Curtiba known as the ecological capital of Brazil? A It is a very modern and new city. B It has a lot of green spaces. C The people there do a lot to protect and conserve the environment. D It is visited by lots of foreigners interested in the environment. 2 What does the author mean in line 13 when it says the residents ‘came up with a revolutionary idea’? A Their idea made a lot of people angry. B Their idea was original and different. C Their idea caused a lot of political change. D Their idea made a lot of money for the city. 3 Which of the following does not happen in Curtiba? A Families separate their household waste. B Residents are given food as a reward for recycling their rubbish. C Residents help to keep the city clean and tidy. D Recycled waste is used to produce electricity. 4 Why don’t many people in Curtiba use cars? A Because the public transport system is so efficient. B Because there are too many traffic jams. C Because many roads in the city are for buses only. D Because fuel is very expensive. 5 Why does Curtiba have less pollution than other cities? A It is smaller than other cities. B Cars use fuel which doesn’t cause pollution. C People don’t use cars much and buses use fuel which doesn’t cause much pollution. D There are only 1,200 buses in the city. 6 In line 31 what does ‘this’ refer to? A the large population of the city. B the fact that all growth was balanced with consideration for the environment. C the growth in population from 1950. D the average income for each person in the city. 7 How did the city solve the problem of flooding? A by building fewer buildings. B by making sure there were lots of lakes. C by creating more parks. D They didn’t do anything but hoped nature would solve the problem itself. 8 What is special about the city’s university? A You can only study environmental courses there. B It is the only university where you can study bio-architecture. C It is a very attractive building. D You don’t have to pay to study there."

    "text": "How many times do you hear people say they don’t have time to do something? All the time! ‘I meant to do that but I didn’t have time!’ is something we say or think far too often; it is the number one excuse for not doing something we should have done. 9 .......... This is a relationship which has also changed a lot through history. Think about all the machines and time-saving gadgets that are now a part of our everyday life that people living 100 or even 50 years ago had to do without; washing machines, vacuum cleaners, microwaves and dishwashers are just a few. We have mobile phones now so that we can contact each other at any time no matter where we are. the Internet gives us access to just about any information we could possibly want as well as providing instant communication with other people anywhere in the world, 10 .......... The idea of using time efficiently has become increasingly important in the Western world. People in wealthy developed countries are often expected to do several jobs at once. At a time when unemployment is high and international competition is strong there is a lot of pressure on companies and individual workers to be as efficient as possible and to get as much work done as possible in the limited time available. 11 .......... This concept of time pressure has also been passed on to the less developed countries where many of the goods for developing countries are made. In places like India and Mexico people often have to work very long shifts, sometimes as much as 12 to 16 hours a day, or even for 48 hours without a break. Goods have to be produced to meet demand in the developed world and this demand puts a lot of pressure on workers. Time is increasingly becoming a commodity like any other. 12 .......... Do you use the self-service check out in the supermarket? Have you bought furniture and then assembled it yourself at home? Have you spent time setting up a new computer? If you have then you have been working for free. It is possible to buy and sell time these days. For example, you can pay someone else to do your shopping for you or walk your dog for you if you don’t have time, but it won’t be cheap. A positive reflection of how our relationship with time is changing is that in some cities there are things called time banks where you can exchange time with other busy people. 13 .......... You will then be paid back in time when you need it. No money changes hands but everyone has to pay into the bank in time. The biggest challenge we face in our personal lives is how not to waste time and make the most of the time we have. According to recent research 20% of people regularly cancel social arrangements because of a lack of time and men do this more often than women. However, cancelling social arrangements can have a serious negative impact because it reduces our quality of life; it can stop us doing what we want, which can lead to unhappiness. 14 .......... This doesn’t have to be something active or sociable; it might be finding time to read a good book. By making sure we don’t miss out on the things we enjoy and value we are likely to be happier and more satisfied with life in general. The key to making the most of our time, both at work and in our personal lives, is prioritising. It is important to recognise which things need to be done immediately and which can wait until later. 15 .......... You might think that revising for an exam or doing homework at the last minute is a good way of saving time but the results will not be as good. Finally, psychologists say that people who are always on time tend to be organised and have everything under control. Those who are usually early are likely to be anxious and in need of being in control all the time. People who are often late are probably just disorganised, although it might be that they are consciously or unconsciously rebelling against our time obsessed society. A In spite of these new inventions we still run out of time. B If you have some free time you can volunteer to do something for someone else like wait for a delivery or water their plants while they are on holiday. C As a result working hours have increased by 25% in the USA and in Japan workers sometimes sleep in the office. D Time is money and nowadays many companies try to save time and money by making their customers work for free. E Time is a very precious commodity and humans have always had a very close relationship with it. F If you try to do too many things at once you are more likely to make mistakes and waste time going back to correct them. G This doesn’t mean we should put off things which are boring or difficult just because we don’t want to do them. H It is important to find time for ourselves to do the things which matter most to us."

    "text": " You are going to read an article in which four people talk about cheating in exams. For questions 16-30 choose from the people (A-D). The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which person or people: was caught cheating in an exam? 16 | didn’t let a friend copy their work? 17 | probably got better marks as a result of cheating? 18 | 19 | regrets trying to cheat in an exam? 20 | cheated more than once? 21 | 22 | didn’t get caught because a friend helped them? 23 | tried to cheat by writing notes on a part of their body? 24 | cheated by asking a friend to tell them the answers? 25 | only tried to cheat in the subject they weren’t good at? 26 | decided not to cheat again after a bad experience? 27 | 28 | thinks it is always wrong to cheat? 29 | thinks there is nothing wrong with cheating? 30 | Cheating in exams A My friend and I had the same surname so we always ended up sitting next to each other, or one behind the other, in exams at school. We worked out this system where we would pass a piece of paper to each other with the answers to the questions. Sometimes we just passed it by hand if we were sitting close enough and other times we’d throw it on the floor for the other person to pick up. It was quite a good system and I think over lots of exams we probably helped each other equally so it was fair and I’m sure we both got higher marks. Unfortunately a teacher did see us doing it once. I was just leaning down to pick up a paper my friend was passing back to me when a teacher appeared out of nowhere and picked it up first. There was no way we could deny what we were doing, it was so obvious. The teacher didn’t say anything until the end of the exam and then when she collected our papers she wrote a big zero at the top. We didn’t do it anymore after that, it had been good before but we decided it wasn’t worth the risk. B This happened when I was about 14 years old. The last exam of the year was history, which had always been my worst subject. I was useless at remembering dates and people’s names so I decided to write the dates and names of the important events we’d studied on the inside of my arm and then wore a jumper to cover it up so no-one could see. Unfortunately though, it was a really hot day. I really wanted to take my jumper off but I couldn’t. I realised after about ten minutes that there was no way I would be able to look at what I’d written without the teacher seeing and I just wished I hadn’t done it. I felt so hot and uncomfortable and was really worried about the teacher seeing and catching me that I didn’t do very well in the test at all. I was too distracted. I think I probably would have got a better result if I hadn’t tried to cheat. I learnt a good lesson though. I never tried to cheat again after that. C I used to always cheat in my maths exams when I was at school. We were allowed to take a calculator with us into the exam and I used to write all the important formulae that we were supposed to remember on the inside of the calculator case. I did it lots of times. I don’t regret it at all. I was quite good at maths anyway but I’m sure I got better results as a result of cheating. In other exams like chemistry and physics, I sometimes wrote notes on bits of tissue then pretended I needed to blow my nose and looked at my notes during the exam. It worked really well. There was only one time I was almost caught; I dropped the tissue on the floor by accident just as a teacher was walking past. He was about to pick it up when my friend, who had also seen what had happened, deliberately knocked over his water bottle. The teacher was so busy clearing up the water I think he forgot about me. If you’re clever enough to work out a way to cheat and not get caught then I think you deserve to get good marks. It’s like that in the real world; if you can do something more easily and with less hard work then you will. Why not? D I’ve never cheated in an exam and really don’t see the point. I mean sooner or later people will find out if you know something or not. If you cheat to get better results then you’re lying to yourself as well as to everyone else. Rather than spending your time thinking of really clever and original ways to cheat without anyone realising, you should just spend that time studying. I’m sure it will help you a lot more in the long run. A friend once tried to read my answers in an exam while pretending to pick something up off the floor. As soon as I realised I covered my work so he couldn’t see. He was quite annoyed with me afterwards but I didn’t think it was fair that he should do well because of my hard work."

Even though Nick knew he hadn’t forgotten anything he had to check and double check he had his passport, tickets and wallet in his bag before he left the house. He had flown plenty of times before so this wasn’t the first time but he still felt nervous. But then this was no ordinary trip; this time he wasn’t just travelling abroad for a few weeks; he was about to start a whole new life on the other side of the world. He had spent months planning for it and couldn’t believe the day had finally arrived when he was heading for the airport about to get on a plane to India. He had never been there before but felt prepared as he had read so much about the place and watched various documentaries. They had also told him a lot about what to expect on the training course he had been on for his new job. There was no denying though that it was going to be very different from the life he was used to. His brother had offered to drive him to the airport, which he was very grateful for. His brother arrived exactly on time, as always, and together they carried his bags down to the car. It felt strange locking the door behind him, not knowing when he would see the place again. A friend of his was going to move in and rent it from him while he was away so he didn’t have to worry about it being empty. But it still made him sad to lock the door and leave. In the car driving to the airport his brother’s son kept them entertained talking about a party he had been to the day before and explaining in great detail what he could now do on his new bike. It was perfect; Nick didn’t want to think too much about where he was going and it was much better to be distracted by his six-year-old nephew. They arrived at the airport and Nick’s brother and nephew came in with him to check in his bags. Then they walked together to the security check. Nick had been dreading this moment, he had said goodbye to so many people recently and even cried at the end of his leaving party but this was the final goodbye; from this moment he was on his own. His nephew suddenly wanted a drink and so they said a quick goodbye and before they could get too emotional his nephew had dragged his brother away to the shop and he was standing on his own. He got ready to go through security, took off his jacket, took his laptop out of his bag and took his mobile and keys out of his pocket. This was it, he was really leaving. He walked around the shops for a while and bought some newspapers and books. He had been told his new colleagues would be grateful for these. He wasn’t planning to read them himself, his only plan for the flight was to sleep and maybe watch a film if they were showing something good. He walked to the gate and in no time at all he was sitting on the plane listening to the safety announcements. As the plane taxied down the runway he thought about how he had ended up where he was. It hadn’t been simple fate or destiny; he had gone looking for this opportunity. No-one had asked him to do it. He had made the effort to find this job; he had applied for it and out of over 20 candidates they had decided to give it to him. In a way he had fought for this seat on the plane and he had won. He deserved to be here and he was excited. He was going to miss all his friends and family but what he was going to do was amazing. It was the job he had always dreamed of; it was what he had spent years studying for. It wasn’t going to be easy but he felt very ready for the challenge. He felt with absolute certainty that he had made the right decision. He smiled to himself and as the plane left the ground he looked out of the window and said a silent goodbye to all the people he was leaving behind. 1 Why did he feel nervous before he left the house? A He had never flown on his own before. B He thought he had forgotten something. C He was about to go on holiday with someone he didn’t know. D He was about to make a big change in his life. 2 How much did he know about the place he was going to? A nothing B a lot; he had been there before C quite a lot; he had tried to learn about it D hardly anything; only what friends had told him. 3 Why did he feel strange locking the door? A He didn’t want his friend to live there. B He was going to miss all the things he had left behind. C He was worried about it being empty. D He was unsure when he would come back. 4 How did he feel about his nephew being in the car to the airport? A pleased B annoyed C amused D disappointed. 5 What happened when they said goodbye at the airport? A Nick’s nephew cried and ran away. B Nick cried. C Nick’s brother cried. D No-one cried. 6 Why did he buy newspapers and magazines at the airport? A He had forgotten to buy them before. B Other people had asked him to buy them. C He wanted something to read on the plane. D He knew the people he was going to be working with would like them. 7 Why does he say in line 32 ‘It hadn't been simple fate or destiny’? A He had worked hard to get this new job. B Getting the job had been a very long and complicated process. C He had been very unlucky to get this job. D He got the job because he had done what other people told him to do. 8 Which best describes how Nick was feeling as the plane took off? A worried B calm C sad D tired."

    "text": "You are going to read an interview with a couple who own a holiday home in the French Pyrenees. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Why did you decide to buy a holiday home here? We have always loved travelling and spending time in different countries on holidays. It made sense to us to have somewhere which was our own, where we could go back to again and again whenever we liked. (9) .......... It has everything we were looking for: mountains, beautiful scenery, good countryside for walking and there are towns and a major city nearby. We looked at some very remote places but decided we wanted to be in a town. We enjoy being able to walk down to the shops in the morning to get fresh bread and walk to a restaurant for dinner in the evening. It was important to us that it was easy to get to for short holidays too so the fact that there is an airport nearby was a key factor. (10) .......... How did you find this particular property? We did some research into the area we liked and we looked at adverts on the Internet, which gave us an idea of what was available. Then we went to an agency which specialised in property in the area where we were looking. They were really helpful and in three days they took us to a number of different houses as well as some empty plots of land with potential for building a new property. (11) .......... We spent time talking to the couple who were selling it and looking around the garden as well as the house. It’s not a big house; there are only two bedrooms, but it is exactly what we were looking for. It has a fantastic terrace with views of the mountains and because it is high up we can see right over the town too. It’s very picturesque. It has a wonderful big fireplace too so is nice and warm in winter. In fact it is a beautiful place to have a holiday at any time of the year. What do you like most about owning a second home? (12) .......... We spend lots of holidays here ourselves and sometimes friends and family join us, but we also let friends and family stay in it by themselves if they want to. It means the house is occupied more, and the more it is used the better. It would be a shame if it were empty a lot of the time. We also like that we have met some good friends here. (13) .......... Have you ever had any problems with the house? Fortunately no, nothing serious but it is always a worry when it is empty for long periods of time and we are so far away. We are lucky to have helpful neighbours and friends who live nearby who can keep an eye on the house for us. In the very cold weather last winter the pipe to the outside tap froze and split but the postman noticed and sealed it for us. We had a problem with the hot water tank once too. We arrived one time and turned it on and suddenly water started pouring down the stairs. (14) .......... We were able to get a plumber to come and look at it and then arranged for a new one to be fitted so it wasn’t too bad. One advantage of not always being here is that we have been able to have both the bathrooms redecorated. Some friends of ours did all the work for us and it worked out really well. Would you like to move and live here permanently? No. We have too much that we would miss back home: good friends and family. (15) .......... We might come for a month or more at a time instead of a week or two as we do now. But we bought it as a holiday home or second home not somewhere to live all the time. We like having both our homes and don’t want to give up either of them. We are very lucky that we can enjoy spending time in two lovely houses. A We visited this area a couple of times and we really liked it. B That wasn’t a very good start to our holiday but it is lucky it happened to us and not friends of ours. C Next year we will both retire and then we will be able to spend much more time here. D And finally we were looking for somewhere in contrast to where we live the rest of the year. E The house we now own was actually the last one we saw and we instantly knew it was perfect. F The weather is usually better than what we’re used to at home with lots of blue sky and sunshine, even in winter. G It is so nice each time we come out to have a group of people to spend time with and social events to go to. H We love that we can share it with our friends and family."

The people may be chosen more than once. When more than one answer is required they may be given in any order. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.

I 29 I I 30 I Memorable train journeys A London to Brighton (UK) I spent over ten years doing this journey every day of the week. I’m very relieved I am retired now. I still do the same journey sometimes but now I don’t have to travel in the rush hour and if there are delays it doesn’t matter so much. The journey when it went well wasn’t bad at all. It wasn’t too long and I was usually able to sit down and read the newspaper. It was quite pleasant as long as there were no annoying people having loud phone conversations. But generally it was fine and not a bad way to begin and end a busy day in the city. The problems and stress came with the all too frequent delays and cancellations. It was extremely frustrating, especially as I was paying so much money for my ticket. The cost was much too high in my opinion. I am glad I don’t have to pay that anymore. B Moscow to St Petersburg (Russia) The most memorable train journey I have ever been on was between Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia. We were about 17 years old and on a school trip to see the places we were studying in our Russian history lessons. We spent three days in Moscow then took the overnight train to St Petersburg. I remember feeling really excited about it. I had never been on an overnight train journey before. We went to the theatre on our last evening in Moscow and then went straight to the station to get on the train at about 11 pm. There were four of us in each room and our whole group occupied about two carriages of the train. Our teachers were very aware of the dangers of travelling by train at night in Russia and warned us never to walk around the train on our own. They told us to go in groups of three to the toilets so that two people could wait outside together while one person went in. That frightened us a little but nothing happened. I don’t think we slept much; we stayed up most of the night talking, but I remember waking up in the morning and realising it was daylight outside and that we were in a completely new city. It was amazing. C Casablanca to Marrakech (Morocco) We decided to travel by train because it was cheap and it only took three hours. Also, I thought a train journey through the desert would be interesting and different. In reality it wasn’t quite as much fun as I had hoped. We got to the station in plenty of time and got our tickets without too much difficulty. The chaos started when we went out to the platform. It appeared that everyone else in the station was also planning to get on the same train as us. It was really crowded. When the train arrived it was a real fight to get on and all the seats were occupied in seconds. My friend and I got separated in the confusion but there was no way we could move so we just had to stand where we were and hold on. My friend managed to sit down after about an hour but I had to stand for the whole three hours. The scenery was quite spectacular in places but the train was hot and uncomfortable. D Cairns to Karanga (Australia) I went on this train journey while I was visiting some friends who lived in Australia. I went away for a few days on my own and before I left, my friends had recommended this trip; it was definitely worth it. It used to be an old mining train that took miners to work every day. It starts on the coast and goes right up the side of a mountain. It is very steep and the views are fantastic looking back out to sea. There is lots of information in the different stations about the people who built the railway originally. It was a very dangerous job and many of them died while they were doing it, either through accidents or disease. The whole journey only takes about an hour but you see all sorts of amazing things on the way. At one point it even goes through a tropical rainforest and there are some really beautiful plants. It is a wonderful trip to do as a tourist, but I’m sure the miners didn’t enjoy it quite so much."

Write your answer in 120-150 words in an appropriate style on the opposite page. 1 You have just read an article in your school magazine about desktop security. Read the extract from the article and the notes you have made. Then write a letter to the editor. How do I know if I have a virus? How does my computer become infected with a virus? Are you one of those computer users who are unaware of the danger and harmful effects of viruses? You should compare your computer to your home. Would you leave your front and back doors unlocked at night or when you leave the house? Would you keep ground floor windows open all day even when no one is home? A virus, like a thief, sneaks in as unobtrusively as possible, hoping to wreak havoc on your personal belongings like financial data, private and work files, and computer system files. For some reason, there are people out there who enjoy making viruses. Desktop security software, if it’s good, will be responsible for taking out these threats, and allowing you the supreme comfort of being able to surf the Internet in peace. A virus can do so much damage to your computer within the span of 24 hours. It can delete files, corrupt files so that when you open them, they look like a mishmash of numbers and alphabets (called garbled text), and they can infect the emails you send out thereby infecting the computers of the people you email to. A virus can totally shut down your PC so that you won’t be able to use it unless you have it reformatted. Make sure you read various computer security software reviews to get the best software to protect you. There are different types of computer viruses aside from the one that attaches to emails. These different types of computer viruses are: Overwrite, Resident, File Infecting, and Boot Virus. Their objectives are different parts of the computer with one thing in mind - destroy, destroy, destroy. How does the security software work? What software would you recommend? You need the antivirus software without a doubt, and unless you get one, you will always be at the mercy of these dark, destructive thieves of the Internet. Write your letter. You must use grammatically correct sentences with accurate spelling and punctuation in a style appropriate for the situation."

On the fourth was an iron railing through which you saw a vast lawn and beyond this some of the buildings of King's School. One small boy was wandering disconsolately, kicking up the gravel as he walked. \"Hulloa. Venning,\" shouted Mr. Watson. \"When did you turn up?\" The small boy came forward and shook hands. \"Here's a new boy. He's older and bigger than you, so don't you bully him.\" The headmaster glared amicably at the two children, filling them with fear by the roar of his voice, and then with a guffaw left them. \"What's your name?\" \"Carey.\" \"What's your father?\" \"He's dead.\" \"Oh! Does your mother wash?\" \"My mother's dead, too.\" Philip thought this answer would cause the boy a certain awkwardness, but Venning was not to be turned from his facetiousness for so little. \"Well, did she wash?\" he went on. \"Yes,\" said Philip indignantly. \"She was a washerwoman then?\" \"No, she wasn't.\" \"Then she didn't wash.\" The little boy crowed with delight at the success of his dialectic. Then he caught sight of Philip's foot. \"What's the matter with your foot?\" Philip instinctively tried to withdraw and hid it behind the one which was whole. \"I've got a club foot.\" he answered. \"How did you get it?\" \"I've always had it.\" \"Let's have a look.\" \"No.\" \"Don't then.\" The little boy accompanied the words with a sharp kick on Philip's shin, which Philip did not expect and thus could not guard against. The pain was so great that it made him gasp, but greater than the pain was the surprise. He did not know why Venning kicked him. He had not the presence of mind to give him a black eye. Besides, the boy was smaller than he, and he had read in The Boy's Own paper that it was a mean thing to hit anyone smaller than yourself. While Philip was nursing his shin, a third boy appeared and his tormentor left him. In a little while he noticed that the pair were talking about him, and he felt they were looking at his feet. He grew hot and uncomfortable. But others arrived, a dozen together, and they began to talk about their doings during the holidays, where they had been, and what wonderful cricket they had played. A few new boys appeared, and with these presently Philip found himself talking. He was shy and nervous. He was anxious to make himself pleasant. but he could not think of anything to say. He was asked a great many questions and answered them all quite willingly. One boy asked him whether he could play cricket. \"No,\" answered Philip. \"I've got a club foot.\" The boy looked down quickly and reddened. Philip saw that he felt he had asked an unseemly question. He was too shy to apologise and looked at Philip awkwardly. 31 What does 'strides' mean in line 3, column 1? A. brooms B. leaps C. steps D. yells 32 When Philip is shown around the school, it is A. mostly empty. B. bright and cheerful. C. small and cramped. D. full of noise and activity. 33 Why were the children afraid of Mr. Watson? A. He was very loud. B. He was angry with them. C. He was unkind to them. D. He was very big and powerful. 34 What does 'his tormentor' in line 22 column 2 refer to? A. Philip's club foot B. the boy called Venning C. the third boy to arrive D. the pain in Philip's shin 35 Why does Philip become hot and uncomfortable when the boys talked about his foot? A. It was summertime. B. He had been beaten. C. He was embarrassed. D. He felt left out. 36 How do the boys who interact with Philip directly react to his club foot? A. They pay it little attention. B. They are curious or embarrassed. C. They are polite and sympathetic. D. They are disgusted by it."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about one person's experiences of learning to skydive. Six sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-G the one which fits each gap 37-42. There is one sentence which you do not need to use. The Skydiving Experience The thrill of skydiving is beyond any possible description. Falling at 120 mph with the wind screaming past your body is an unbelievable experience of total freedom. The sport is not without an element of danger; this fear that makes it so addictive. Yet there are relatively few serious injuries in this activity because of the tight regulations and safety requirements mandated for skydiving and parachuting organisations. I still recall my first jump from 2,500 feet using what is called a static line. 37 ........... often used for those new to the sport. It is a means of helping them to deal with the sensation of falling, ensuring that they will not actually hit anything. Still, there seems to be a little slice of missing time from the point where I let go of the aircraft to the parachute canopy actually opening. Pure terror sometimes does that! It was a moment where time ceased to exist, not quite a total blackout but still quite strange. Two days of training on the ground, counting out \"one thousand, two thousand, three thousand\" and about all I seem to recall when jumping is something like \"aaaaahhhhhh\". 38 ........... After a second and many subsequent jumps, this sensation soon faded to a dim recollection as I became accustomed to falling. The first real free fall commenced at about the fifth jump. This simply involved letting go of the aircraft and immediately deploying the canopy. 39 ........... Starting from three seconds (let go and pull the ripcord) to five seconds (let go, count to three then pull the ripcord) increasing to seven seconds and so on. Once I made it to ten seconds and beyond, it became important to use an altimeter. Free fall became really interesting at the 15-second mark because that is when the real training started. Tumbling and rocketing forward by using different body positions put a completely new challenge. I learned it was possible to put my body in a position where forward ground speed was around 80 mph with an increase of downward velocity close to 200 mph – the ears tend to get a little warm! It was necessary to flare out, slow and adopt a more stable position before deploying the canopy. Doing so at really high velocity really hurts, and I suspect everyone does this at least once. It is quite a lot of stress on your body when pulling up from 120 mph to 10 mph in about two or three seconds. 40 ........... One of my most fearful experiences occurred when I made a complete mess of trying to do a reverse tumble and became wildly unstable. Nothing I did seemed to correct the spinning and rolling, in desperation I deployed the canopy. 41 ........... The bag wrapped around one of my legs. Luckily, I had enough free fall experience to have the presence of mind to see what was happening and carefully reach down and disentangle the risers. I also knew there was plenty of time to correct the problem because I was far higher than the standard 2,500 deployment altitude. It turned out fine in the end. I would say one of my most memorable free falling experiences was above the Mornington Peninsula in Australia. 42 ........... From this altitude, I did some nice slow turns and drank in the scenery of Port Phillip Bay, out to sea, across the length of the peninsula to the city of Melbourne, all in an orange-red glow of the most amazing sunset I can ever remember. It was incredible. A. There are few other ways to experience the total and utter freedom of flight. B. This is a strong nylon tape that is attached to the aircraft on one end, and to the release pin of the jumper's canopy on the other. C. I think my ears are still ringing from that mistake. D. Altitudes increased gradually, as did time in free-fall. E. It was a 40-second fall from 14,000 feet, right at sunset. F. What happened next was not good at all. G. My first experience is still very sharp in my memory."

KATIE I'm afraid of spiders. You won't hear me scream, but I will certainly get out of the room until someone else has dealt with it. Once, when I was a teenager, and my parents were both working late, I sat on the front steps of the house for nearly five hours waiting for help. There was a spider on the ceiling in the hallway, you see! I couldn't get into the house! My father was quite angry with me when he got home; he thought I needed to learn to be more independent.\"How will you ever survive if you have to live alone someday?\" he asked. Well, I'm sure if I had to I would just deal with it, although it would be a challenge. But I've never had to live alone. I had flatmates at university, and now I'm married. Luckily my husband has no problem with spiders, and is tolerant of my phobia! B. ELLIE The most challenging thing I've ever done, by far, was trekking in the Himalayas. It was something I'd always dreamed of doing and I was incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to join a trek for charity. I always considered myself fit; I mean, I go to the gym two or three times a week. But as soon as we set out I realised I was quite out of my depth; I'd never even carried a pack before. In retrospect, I can't imagine what I was thinking. On the first day, we had a six-hour walk and after four hours I was so exhausted I felt that I couldn't go on. I took off my pack, sat down, and cried. Apparently my reaction was fairly common so our group leader knew just how to deal with it. He calmly explained that we were only two more hours from our first camp, while I'd have to walk for four, alone, to go back! I had no choice. I had to continue. So I did, and when we eventually reached Everest base camp it was the proudest I've ever been. C. DANIEL After high school I was accepted into a very good music school, by merit of my audition. I almost declined; I didn't want to go to university. It was a terribly difficult time because nobody could understand why I would make that decision. My fear of heights was affecting my life because I had difficulty going up and down stairs or over bridges, particularly if I could see down, beneath me. I would just get paralysed. I would feel nauseous, and my feet would feel heavy, as if they were made of lead. I had read that it was possible to get over phobias by exposure, so I put myself into difficult situations on purpose. It was exhausting, but I knew it was important. I noticed slight improvements, but only very slight. It was frustrating. Then I had the idea: I was going to try bungee jumping. I got a trusted friend to go with me; to make sure I didn't change my mind. He told the people in charge they would have to push me, because I wouldn't jump. It was all very fast; there was no time to think. The feeling was exhilarating, to be honest. And I've had no trouble in my day-to-day life since then. Though, I admit, I have no desire to do it again. D. JACK I wasn't even trying. Eventually I found my way to an office that offered support to students with special needs; I think someone told me that I could get a free computer, or something. That turned my life around. To get the computer I had to attend regular meetings with an advisor, which I hated at first, but eventually I learned to recognise my strengths and be realistic about my weaknesses; I realised I could get help when I needed it, and that was OK. That was the hardest thing; but once I'd understood it, there was no stopping me."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about an adventure centre. For questions 1-8, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. I’m focused. Completely terrified, but focused. I’ve got a tiny area to stand on and beneath me is a 10-metre drop. To make things worse, the totem pole that I’m trying to climb onto is shaking. With one knee bent on the top of the pole and the other foot next to it, I slowly stand up with my arms outstretched for balance. Once upright, my legs are still wobbling but an enormous smile has spread across my face. I shuffle my toes over the edge. And then I jump. Back on the ground, my knees won't stop quaking. But for the boys at Head 4 Heights, an aerial adventure centre in Cirencester, it’s all in a day’s work. Head 4 Heights, one of the tallest climbing centres in Britain, opened two years ago. It’s the only UK climbing centre open to the public year-round (the only days it closes are when winds exceed 70 mph, almost enough to blow you off a totem pole and into one of the lakes). The course was set up by Rod Baber, adventurer extraordinaire and holder of the world record for scaling the highest peak of every country in Europe in the shortest time. Rod’s latest plan is to snag the record for North and South America as well, but in between he starts every day with a clamber round the Cirencester course. His favourite is the ‘Trapeze’ challenge: ‘It still gets me every time. Eyes dilate, mouth goes dry and adrenalin goes everywhere. Although the course is only roughly the size of a tennis court, it packs a lot into a small space. There are four totem poles (of varying degrees of difficulty according to the holds attached to them), a stairway to heaven (a giant ladder with an increasing distance between the rungs), two freefall platforms and a trapeze jump. Plans for a new 30-metre pole are presently under way. All can be made easier or harder, according to ability, and incorporated into different challenges, which is why the course has proved a success with families, corporate days out and the armed forces. More than half who visit return for more and the centre now averages about 1,500 visitors a month. All ages over five are welcome, but children are the most enthusiastic and ‘far easier to teach than the bankers,’ says Rod. Parents are usually more reluctant to join in. ‘We hear all sorts of excuses,’ says Rod. ‘Everything from bad knees to “I haven't trimmed my toenails”.’ The oldest customer was a 78-year-old who arrived with his son and grandson. When the younger two decided to give it a miss, the grandfather set off to show them how it was done. For the most part, though, people start off nervous and only gain confidence as they progress. ‘Everything is kept very positive. We always tell people to look up not down and to take their time,’ says Rod. ‘We want to push people outside their comfort zone and into the adventure zone, but we don’t want people to be pushed into the panic zone, which can be mentally damaging.’ Also reassuring is the 100 per cent safety record. The course was designed and built by Nick Moriarty, an expert in his field who has constructed 450 courses in 16 countries and trained 2,700 instructors. Key to the design is the safety-rope system, which ensures that if you do lose your balance or grip, your full-body harness will guarantee that you float, not fall, back to earth. What isn’t guaranteed, though, is family harmony. “The Leap of Love” is usually left as the final challenge and involves two (similarly sized) people squeezing themselves onto a ‘bird table’ at the top of a totem pole, before jumping in tandem to grab a trapeze. Not everything always goes according to plan. Aside from not arguing, both people need to be careful not to unbalance each other and must jump at exactly the same time. ‘We do have some people who have refused to speak to each other afterwards,’ says Rod, ‘but if you can both make it together, it’s such a buzz.’. 1 One problem the writer describes in the first paragraph is that A she keeps falling off the totem pole. B she is trying to stand on top of a moving object. C she cannot get her arms into the right position. D she is too nervous to complete the climb. 2 What do we learn about Head 4 Heights in the second paragraph? A It remains open even in quite windy conditions. B Rod Baber got the idea for it while climbing mountains. C It did not initially stay open throughout the year. D It is aimed at people who don't have the chance to climb mountains. 3 What does Rod Baber say about the ‘Trapeze’ challenge? A He does it more often than anything else on the course. B He always fails to complete it. C He continues to find it difficult. D He takes a long time to recover after doing it. 4 The writer says that the main reason for the course's popularity is that A the challenges it offers cannot be found anywhere else. B new challenges are constantly being added. C it can be completed in a fairly short time. D it can be adapted for different people. 5 The people who ‘decided to give it a miss’ (column 2) are examples of people who A find it difficult to do the course. B are unwilling to do the course. C are easily taught how to do the course. D give up while they are doing the course. 6 Rod says that the intention of the course is that people taking part A learn how to deal with extreme fear. B progress as quickly as possible. C take risks they might not initially want to take. D increase in confidence after repeated visits. 7 The writer uses the phrase ‘Also reassuring’ (column 3) to emphasize A that people benefit from doing the course. B how carefully the course has been constructed. C that people should not be afraid to do the course. D how enthusiastic Rod is about the course. 8 What is said about ‘The Leap of Love’? A Most people fail to do it successfully. B It can cause people to fall out with each other. C It is the hardest challenge on the course. D Some people don't try hard enough to do it."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about jobs that involve international travel. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. WANT TO JOIN § THE JET SET? You could be jetting off to exotic locations, staying in five-star hotels, eating in top-class restaurants, and it’s all paid for by your employer. Who wouldn’t want a job that involves foreign travel? (9)  And there are plenty of opportunities. International travel is growing significantly. And citing business travel experience on your CV can bring enormous professional benefits. But it’s not always as exciting as it sounds. There is a big difference between travelling to Milan as a tourist and travelling there to spend a day in the type of hotel meeting room that can be found anywhere in Europe. It can be very exciting, but you need to keep your feet firmly on the ground. (10)  On the other hand, it does bring personal benefits, and it also has a dramatic effect on promotion prospects. Flights can be delayed, things can go wrong and it’s easy to get exhausted. Many jobs mean travelling alone, so you can be lonely. Simply targeting any job that involves foreign travel is not the way to start. (11)  Making travel your first requirement is not the way to choose a career. It’s as illogical as saying you want a job that involves wearing smart clothes. Instead, you should consider all the usual factors, such as qualifications and experience, and only then choose a sector or company that offers opportunities for international travel. The travel and hotel trades are obvious areas, but the commercial sector also offers good prospects for travel. In the retail sector, buyers often travel, especially if they work in fresh produce, where they have to check the suitability of crops. (12)  Employment in communications, banking and finance, and property management is also worth looking at. Jobs in the engineering and environment sector can involve travel, too. Almost any career can mean international travel, if you choose the right company and role. The number of jobs involving travel, especially at middle-management level, is growing. So what will help you secure a role with an international flavour? (13)  Employers look for candidates with an international outlook. A second language is a good indication of how well someone will adapt. You need to show you are flexible and willing to learn. If your company has a sister company in the Czech Republic, for instance, learning some Czech will boost your chances. Find out what the company offers as a support package. Many now guarantee that you can return home at the weekends, or they will limit the amount that people travel each year. (14)  But not all employers are like this. One company asked graduates fresh out of university to move to another country over a weekend, alone, and to find their own accommodation. And it’s as well to remember that international travel can be stressful. People can get burned out by international business travel. You need to be in control of your schedule, rather than leaving it to the company. You must ensure you get time to rest and talk to your employer all the time about how you are coping. Don’t wait for formal appraisals or until they ask for your views. (15) And realize you might not want to travel for ever. a.)On the other hand, it does bring personal benefits, and it also has a dramatic effect on promotion prospects. b)Making travel your first requirement is not the way to choose a career. c)And realize you might not want to travel for ever. d)Employers look for candidates with an international outlook. e)And there are plenty of opportunities. f)But not all employers are like this. g)Speak to seasoned international business travellers to get an idea of what you will face. h)Employment in communications, banking and finance, and property management is also worth looking at."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about various authors. For questions 16-30, choose from the authors (A-D). The authors may be chosen more than once. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Which author feels that she is not completely in control when she is writing? took action in response to someone's negative view of her chances of getting her work accepted? thinks that her current working arrangement may not be permanent? decides when information given in her books does not have to be true? did something dishonest while trying to get her work accepted? is unwilling to do a great deal of background work for her books? was offered her first contract as a result of an earlier success? makes sure that her books contain strange elements? got great pleasure from carrying out a certain process repeatedly? draws attention to the likelihood of a new author getting their work accepted? wants people to be cheered up by her books? feels that it is an advantage that people give her their sincere views on her work? recommends analysing various aspects of other authors’ books? leaves sentences incomplete while she is writing? felt that her job was taking up too much of her attention? The best-sellers book club Fancy being an author? We asked some of Britain's favourite best-selling writers to share the secrets of their success. A. JOANNE HARRIS Her novels have attracted millions of fans worldwide. MY BIG BREAK I was a full-time teacher and made time to write my first novel before and after school. It took two years. Then I spent a fortune on posting manuscripts to agents. I found one, but he got discouraged when my manuscripts were rejected, so I sacked him and wrote my next novel, which my next agent loved. He got me a deal for both novels. HOW I WORK I travel a lot, on promotional work, but when I’m at home I work in my library, looking out onto the garden. I don’t want to do lots of research, so I stick to subjects I know about. MY BEST ADVICE 100,000 titles are published in the UK every year. For each, 100 are rejected. If, knowing this, you still want to write and you love it, you’re on the right track. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I don't believe in a magic wand. You need ability, luck and hard work. B. LAUREN CHILD She writes and illustrates children’s books for two to 10-year-olds. MY BIG BREAK After school, I did an art course. Then I did all sorts of jobs - making lampshades, working as an assistant to artist Damien Hirst (I painted a lot of the spots on his paintings). I wrote my first book in the hope it would become an animation. I found an agent, but didn’t get a deal for five years. I didn’t lose heart, as so many people were positive about it. Eventually I got a deal and was asked to do a second book. HOW I WORK In the early days I used to work while I answered the phones at a graphic design agency. Some illustrations take hours, and I prefer having other people around. Now, I’ve just bought a new house and have a studio, but I’m not sure how long I'll be able to stand working by myself. MY BEST ADVICE Read as much as you can before you even think of writing. And you can’t please everyone - above all, your work must interest you. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I keep stories simple, but always add a quirky touch - children really like the more bizarre moments in life. I also have a very honest audience who tell me what they think. C. FREYA NORTH She writes lively, fast-paced fiction. MY BIG BREAK I was doing a PhD in Art History and bought a computer. The sheer joy of typing then deleting stuff was compulsive and I started to write fiction that I actually wanted to read. After four years of rejections, I presumed I was doing something wrong. Then I worked for a publishing company and realized I needed an agent. I sent my manuscript with fake reviews I’d made up myself to lots of agents. One took me on and got me a three-book deal. HOW I WORK I used to work at our kitchen table, but now I go to the library. Touch-typing was the best thing I ever learnt. I never interrupt the flow and just throw in asterisks if I can’t think of an adjective. It’s as if the story and the characters have taken me over and I have to struggle to keep up! MY BEST ADVICE Let your character dictate the story. It could be the most intricate plot in the world, but if the characters aren’t ‘real’, no one will care. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I write simply and keep chapters short so my readers can enjoy them on journeys home at the end of a bad day. I want them to giggle. D. MANDA SCOTT She has written a cult series of historical novels. MY BIG BREAK I was a veterinary anaesthetist. On my 30th birthday, I was climbing a mountain and I was happy, but all I could think about was work on Monday. I decided to follow my heart and make a living from writing. I was among the finalists in a writing competition and from that got a deal for my first book. HOW I WORK I have a routine: in the morning, edit everything from the previous day, then I walk my dogs and write in the afternoon. MY BEST ADVICE Read bad books and work out what makes them bad. Read the books you love and work out why you love them. Write what you will really, really want to read. Always. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS I’m good at judging what needs to be factual and what I can make up."

    "text": "PART 1 You are going to read an extract from a novel. For questions 1–8, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. ‘Afternoon, Mattie!’ Mr Eckler called from the bow of his boat. ‘Got a new one. Brand-new. Just come in. By a Mrs Wharton. House of Mirth, it’s called. I tucked it in behind the coffee beans, under W. You’ll see it.’ ‘Thank you, Mr Eckler!’ I said, excited at the prospect of a new book. ‘Did you read it?’ ‘Yup. Read it whole.’ ‘What’s it about?’ ‘Can’t hardly say. Some flighty city girl. Don’t know why it’s called House of Mirth. It ain’t funny in the least.’ The Fulton Chain Floating Library is only a tiny room, a closet really, below decks in Charlie Eckler’s pickle boat. It is nothing like the proper library we have in Old Forge, but it has its own element of surprise. Mr Eckler uses the room to store his wares, and when he finally gets around to moving a chest of tea or a sack of cornmeal, you never know what you might find. And once in a while, the main library in Herkimer sends up a new book or two. It’s nice to get your hands on a new book before everyone else does. While the pages are still clean and white and the spine hasn’t been snapped. I stepped onto the boat and went below decks. The House of Mirth was under W, like Mr Eckler said it would be, only it was wedged next to Mrs Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Mr Eckler sometimes gets authors and titles confused. I signed it out in a ledger he kept on top of a molasses barrel, then rooted around behind a crate of eggs, a jar of marbles and a box of dried dates but found nothing I hadn’t already read. I remembered to get the bag of cornmeal we needed. I wished I could buy oatmeal or white flour instead, but cornmeal cost less and went further. I was to get a ten-pound bag. The fifty-pound bag cost more to buy but was cheaper per pound and I’d told Pa so, but he said only rich people can afford to be thrifty. Just as I was about to climb back upstairs, something caught my eye – a box of composition books. Real pretty ones with hard covers on them, and swirly paint designs, and a ribbon to mark your place. I put the cornmeal down, and Mrs Wharton too, and picked one up. Its pages were smooth and white. I thought it would be a fine thing to write on paper that nice. The pages in my old composition book were rough and had blurry blue lines printed on them, and were made with so little care that there were slivers of wood visible in them. I handed Mr Eckler fifty cents of my father’s money for the cornmeal. ‘How much is this?’ I asked, holding up one of the pretty composition books. I had sixty cents from all the fiddleheads Weaver and I had sold to the Eagle Bay Hotel. It was money I knew I should have given to my pa. I’d meant to, really. I just hadn’t gotten around to it. ‘Those notebooks? They’re expensive, Mattie. Italians made them. I’ve got to get forty-five cents apiece,’ he said. ‘I’ve got some others coming in for fifteen cents in a week or so if you can wait.’ Forty-five cents was a good deal of money, but I didn’t want the ones for fifteen cents, not after I’d seen the others. I had ideas. Tons of them. For stories and poems. I chewed the inside of my cheek, deliberating. I knew I would have to write a lot when I went to Barnard College – if I went to Barnard College – and it might be a good idea to get a head start. Weaver had said I should be using my words, not just collecting them, and I knew they would just glide across this beautiful paper, and when I was done writing them, I could close them safely inside the covers. Just like a real book. Guilt gnawed at my insides. I took the money from my pocket and gave it to Mr Eckler quickly, so the thing was done and I couldn’t change my mind. Then I watched breathlessly as he wrapped my purchase in brown paper and tied it with string. I thanked him as he handed me the package, but he didn’t hear me because Mr Pulling, the station-master, was asking him the price of oranges. 1 When Mr Eckler told Mattie about the new book, A Mattie felt that it sounded familiar to her. B he said that he thought its title was inappropriate. C he said that it was a book Mattie would enjoy. D Mattie suspected that he hadn’t really read it. 2 What does Mattie say about the library in Mr Eckler’s boat? A New books are frequently added to it. B All the books in it are in excellent condition. C It contains books that are hidden from view. D Mr Eckler doesn’t know exactly what is in it. 3 When Mattie found the new book, she A discovered that there were other new books nearby. B saw that it had been put in the wrong place. C followed Mr Eckler’s system for borrowing books. D had to move something so that she could find it. 4 What was the situation concerning the cornmeal? A Her father was unable to save money by buying the bigger bag. B Her father could not see the point of buying the bigger bag. C Her father felt that cornmeal was better than oatmeal or white flour. D Her father had decided to stop buying what he usually bought. 5 One reason why Mattie liked the look of the composition books was that A the covers were shiny. B the pages were completely clear. C the pages were thicker than in her old book. D they had better ribbons than her old book. 6 When Mattie asked Mr Eckler how much the composition books cost, he said that A they weren’t really worth the money. B they were not the books he had been expecting to receive. C he did not expect many people to buy them. D he had no choice about how much to charge for them. 7 While she was buying one of the books, Mattie thought about A how she could use it for making lists of words.

There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. The Tower and the Glory Chris Wilson starts at the bottom when he joins a Spanish team making competitive human pyramids A large man jams his foot in my ear and jumps on to my shoulders. He is quickly followed by another only slightly smaller gentleman who grabs my belt and shimmies up me like a pole. Another follows. My face contorts with pain as the fourth tier mounts on to my back and I begin to sway dangerously. 9 ______ 'Castelling' (making human castles) is a family sport in Catalonia. Groups normally consist of everyone from tiny children, through awkward adolescents and wiry women, to well-built men at the bottom. 10 ______ I had also heard that being overweight and unfit would not count against me. Sure enough, when I turned up for my first training session, I could sense that, for the first time in years, my ever-expanding physique was being appreciatively looked at. Castelling began almost 200 years ago near Tarragona, just south of Barcelona. Out of nowhere, it seems that people suddenly began forming themselves into human towers. Since then the sport, if you can call it that, has become an expression of Catalan identity, with groups competing to build ever higher and more elegant structures. 11 ______ Once or twice it has managed a six-tier tower. The top teams regularly manage eight or nine. It was my intention to add a little British beef to the group to help them reach the next level in time for the competitions to be held tomorrow in Barcelona on the National Day of Catalonia. At first I had thought that I might like to go on top to bask in the glory, but the club's president soon put me straight. He indicated a spindly little girl who looked as though she had been raised entirely on broccoli, and not much of it at that. It is she who has pride of place on top of the pyramid. 12 ______ For my first try-out I was given the role of segons mans (second hands), which meant that I supported the wrists of the man who supported the buttocks of the first rank of the pyramid. Once I had assumed my position, people began to scramble up me and on to the tower without warning. 13 ______ Still, my hard work must have been appreciated because I was quickly promoted to be primers mans and support the bottoms of the first level of the pyramid that we were making under the watchful eye of the artistic director. My performance in the 'hands' section had obviously been satisfactory because at the third training session I was called forward and given the very great honour of the President's belt. 14 ______ Being offered this belt, still warm from the very waist of the President, was a clear gesture that me and my bulk had been accepted. Finally, I had made it to the bottom of the pile. Being a pillar in a castell is much like being a bass player in a band. You know that everyone in the crowd is cheering for the singer or the lead guitarist, no matter how important the rhythm section. When we take the stage tomorrow, no one in the crowd will know who I am, or even be able to see me down at the bottom. All their cheering will be for the little girl on top. 15 ______ It felt great.A The best I could hope for was to be at the bottom, but even that honour has to be earned. B So I knew that everyone at the training session that night would have cheered with good-natured delight if I had done that. C But that memorable night in Figueres, despite the incredible strain, I held steady and the applause was all for me. D I had been attracted to castelling because I had been told that it requires almost no skill or co-ordination. E Within seconds I had assisted in the formation of a three-tier tower without really noticing what was happening. F It’s not easy being the bottom man of a human pyramid. G Each casteller is wound into a large strip of material worn around the waist to support the back and to help the other castellers grip when they climb. H The group I had joined in Figueres, near the French border, is very much a second-division outfit."

Inventors had first begun to wrestle with the challenge of coming up with a human-powered vehicle in the 17th century. In 1696, a French doctor used his manservant to power a pedal-driven carriage while the master sat up front and steered. The beginnings of the modern bicycle emerged in 1818 when Karl von Drais, an eccentric German baron, invented what we now know as the hobbyhorse. It was bicycle-shaped with wooden wheels and no pedals: the rider pushed it forward with his feet. At £8 – equivalent today to £500 – the hobbyhorse could be afforded only by true gentlemen, and it soon became a much sought-after status symbol. But the craze died out after a year following a statement from the London College of Surgeons, which said darkly that the hobbyhorse could cause ‘internal injuries’. [B] Brilliant minds continued to wrestle with the mechanical horse but made slow progress. Even Britain’s top engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, could come up with nothing better than a hobbyhorse that ran on railway tracks. Finally, in 1887, a Parisian blacksmith called Pierre Michaux added a set of pedals to a hobbyhorse, and the bicycle was born. The Michaux bicycle had pedals fixed directly to the front wheel, just like a child’s tricycle today. Made largely of iron, it weighed as much as a fridge but was easy to ride and took a man up to five miles with the effort he would use to walk only one. Michaux’s first newspaper advertisement in May 1867 offered ‘pedal velocipedes’ for 250 francs. At this price only the wealthy could afford one and a group of 20 young men spent their days showing off their ‘steeds’ before fascinated crowds in the Bois de Boulogne. Michaux was soon producing 20 bicycles a day and decided to organize a women’s race as a stunt to boost his sales further. A racecourse in Bordeaux was roped off, but when the four lady racers made their appearance in short skirts, the crowd of 3,000 burst through the barriers. Nevertheless, the ladies raced on. A contemporary report recorded that Miss Louise took an early lead, but Miss Julle made a ‘superhuman effort’, passing her on the home straight and winning by a nose. Within a year, there were 50,000 bicycles in France. [C] Not to be outdone by their French counterparts, British engineers set about improving bicycle design with wire-spoked wheels and solid rubber tyres. The weight was reduced to a mere 44lb, only twice the weight of a bike today. Gears and chains were still thought too heavy and complex to be fitted to a bicycle, so designers could increase top speed only by increasing the size of the front wheel. Eventually front wheels grew until they were 5ft and the penny farthing was born. Speeds of 20 mph were now possible, but the rider’s seat was directly above the front wheel, which made riding in a skirt impossible, so women were effectively barred from bicycles. To make up for it, manufacturers developed tricycles with low seats. The penny farthing’s biggest drawback was its danger: the high seat was difficult to climb into, and once up there a driver had a long way to fall. [D] In 1885, John Starley launched the Rover Safety Bicycle, the first model to adopt what we now think of as the traditional design. The bicycle industry was unimpressed, as it had a chain-driven rear wheel, which added weight, and a low seat, which made male riders look a bit ridiculous. But it turned out to be faster than a penny farthing because it was more aerodynamic. More importantly, the Rover could be ridden in a skirt. At £22, it was more expensive than a penny farthing, but its practicality was just what the public wanted. Soon there were half a million bicycles in the UK. Between 1890 and 1900, the bicycle was refined until the basic design became very similar to the featherweights that modern champions ride in the Tour de France. Lightweight steel tubing, the diamond-shaped frame, gears and pneumatic tyres with separate inner tubes all became common. Top speeds of 25 mph could now be reached. At last the cyclist could outrun a galloping horse. The bicycle was found in every walk of life: policemen and postmen had them and several European armies issued them to their soldiers. "
