    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a book about life in cities. For questions 31-36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Image and the city In the city, we are barraged with images of the people we might become. Identity is presented as plastic, a matter of possessions and appearances; and a very large proportion of the urban landscape is taken up by slogans, advertisements, flatly photographed images of folk heroes - the man who turned into a sophisticated dandy overnight by drinking a particular brand of drink, the girl who transformed herself into a femme fatale with a squirt of cheap scent. The tone of the wording of these advertisements is usually pert and facetious, comically drowning in its own hyperbole. But the pictures are brutally exact: they reproduce every detail of a style of life, down to the brand of cigarette-lighter, the stone in the ring, and the economic row of books on the shelf. Yet, if one studies a line of ads across from where one is sitting on a tube train, these images radically conflict with each other. Swap the details about between the pictures, and they are instantly made illegible. If the characters they represent really are heroes, then they clearly have no individual claim to speak for society as a whole. The clean-cut and the shaggy, rakes, innocents, brutes, home-lovers, adventurers, clowns all compete for our attention and invite emulation. As a gallery, they do provide a glossy mirror of the aspirations of a representative city crowd; but it is exceedingly hard to discern a single dominant style, an image of how most people would like to see themselves. Even in the business of the mass-production of images of identity, this shift from the general to the diverse and particular is quite recent. Consider another line of stills: the back-lit, soft-focus portraits of the first and second generations of great movie stars. There is a degree of romantic unparticularity in the face of each one, as if they were communal dream-projections of society at large. Only in the specialised genres of westerns, farces and gangster movies were stars allowed to have odd, knobbly cadaverous faces. The hero as loner belonged to history or the underworld: he spoke from the perimeter of society, reminding us of its dangerous edges. ee so stse bee The stars of the last decade have looked quite different. Soft-focus photography has gone, to be replaced by a style which searches out warts and bumps, emphasises the uniqueness not the generality of the face. Voices, too, are strenuously idiosyncratic; whines, stammers and low rumbles are exploited as features of ‘star quality. Instead of romantic heroes and heroines, we have a brutalist, hard-edged style in which isolation and egotism are assumed as natural social conditions. In the movies, as in the city, the sense of stable hierarchy has become increasingly exhausted; we no longer live in a world where we can all share the same values, the same heroes. (It is doubtful whether this world, so beloved of nostalgia moralists, ever existed; but lip-service was paid to it, the pretence, at least, was kept up.) The isolate and the eccentric push towards the centre of the stage; their fashions and mannerisms are presented as having as good a claim to the limelight and the future as those of anyone else. In the crowd on the underground platform, one may observe a honeycomb of fully-worked-out worlds, each private, exclusive, bearing little comparison with its nearest neighbour. What is prized in one is despised in another. There are no clear rules about how one is supposed to manage one’s body, dress, talk, or think. Though there are elaborate protocols and ctiquettes among particular cults and groups within the city, they subscribe to no common standard. For the new arrival, this disordered abundance is the city’s most evident and alarming quality. He feels as if he has parachuted into a funfair of contradictory imperatives. There are so many people he might become, and a suit of clothes, a make of car, a brand of cigarettes, will go some way towards turning him into a personage even before he has discovered who that personage is. Personal identity has always been deeply rooted in property, but hitherto the relationship has been a simple one - a question of buying what you could afford, and leaving your wealth to announce your status. In the modern city, there are so many things to buy, such a quantity of different kinds of status, that the choice and its attendant anxieties have created a new pornography of taste. 31 What does the writer say about advertisements in the first paragraph? A Certain kinds are considered more effective in cities than others. B The way in which some of them are worded is cleverer than it might appear. C They often depict people that most other people would not care to be like. D The pictures in them accurately reflect the way that some people really live. 32 The writer says that if you look at a line of advertisements on a tube train, it is clear that A  city dwellers have very diverse ideas about what image they would like to have. B some images in advertisements have a general appeal that others lack. C city dwellers are more influenced by images on advertisements than other people are. D some images are intended to be representative of everyone's aspirations. 33 What does the writer imply about portraits of old movie stars? A  They tried to disquise the less attractive features of their subjects. B Most people did not think they were accurate representations of the stars in them. C They made people feel that their own faces were rather unattractive. D They reflected an era in which people felt basically safe. 34 What does the writer suggest about the stars of the last decade? A Some of them may be uncomfortable about the way they come across. B They make an effort to speak in a way that may not be pleasant on the ear. C They make people wonder whether they should become more selfish. D Most people accept that they are not typical of society as a whole. 35 The writer uses the crowd on an underground platform to exemplify his belief that A no single attitude to life is more common than another in a city. B no one in a city has strict attitudes towards the behaviour of others. C views of what society was like in the past are often inaccurate. D people in cities would like to have more in common with each other. 36 The writer implies that new arrivals in a city may A  change the image they wish to have too frequently. B  underestimate the importance of wealth. C acquire a certain image without understanding what that involves. D decide that status is of little importance."

    "text": " You are going to read an extract from an autobiography. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A-H the one which fits each gap (37-43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.Eilbeck the features editor I quickly got the hang of working at the Mirror. Every morning at eleven we would be expected to cram into Eilbeck's little office for a features conference, when we either had to come up with ideas of our own or suffer ideas to be thrust upon us. Some of Eilbeck's own offerings were bizarre to say the least, but he did get results. I had got an inkling of his creative thinking during my initial interview when he had invited me to match his scrawled impromptu headline with a feature. 37_________ Some of these brainstorms came off the day's news, some off the wall. About half the ideas worked, a few of them spectacularly. Following a spate of shootings, Eilbeck scrawled 'THIS GUN FOR SALE' on his pad, together with a rough sketch of a revolver. Within hours a writer was back in the office with a handgun and a dramatic piece on the ease with which (he did not mention the little help he had had from the crime staff) he had bought it in Trafalgar Square. 38_______ Mercifully, none of Eilbeck's extemporised headlines winged their way to me at least not yet. The pitifully small paper was grossly overstaffed, with half a dozen highly experienced feature writers fighting to fill one page a day, and it was evident that my role was as standby or first reserve. Hanging around the office, where the time was passed pleasantly in chit-chat, smoking and drinking coffee, I was occasionally tossed some small task. 39_______ Another of my little chores was to compose 'come- ons' for the readers' letters columns - invented, controversial letters that, in a slow week for correspondence, would draw a furious mailbag. I was also put to work rewriting agency and syndication material that came into the office, including, on occasion, the Sagittarius segment of the astrology column. 40_______ Some years later, when he had directed his talents to another paper, I confessed to him one day that I had been guilty of tampering in this way. He was in no way put out. It was serenely obvious to him that I had been planted on the Mirror by destiny to adjust the hitherto inaccurate information. 41________ For example, one afternoon I was summoned to Eilbeck's office to find him in a state of manic excitement, bent over a make-up pad on which he had scrawled 'THE SPICE OF LIFE!' surrounded by a border of stars. This, I was told, was to be the Mirror's new three-times-a-week gossip column, starting tomorrow - and I was to be in charge of it. 42____ Happily the delightful Eve Chapman was deputed to hold my hand in this insane exercise. The bad news was that Eve, who went home nightly to her parents in Croydon, had never set foot in such a place in her life. We were reduced to raiding the society pages of the glossy magazines and ploughing through Who's Who in hopes of finding some important personage with an unusual hobby which could be fleshed out to the maximum twenty-five words. 43______ The Spice of Life column itself ground to a halt after our supply of eminent people's interesting pastimes petered out. A. As a result, he wanted no item to be more than twenty-five words long, followed by three dots. He was, at the time, heavily under the influence of Walter Winchell, Earl Wilson and suchlike night-owl columnists in the New York tabloids that were air-freighted to him weekly. B. Flattering though it was to be entrusted with this commission, there was a snag. It had to ‘sizzle’ – a favourite Elbeck word – with exclusive snippets about ‘the people who really mattered’ – to Elbeck’s mind, anyone with an aristocratic title, or money to throw about in casinos and nightclubs. Unfortunately, I did not have a single suitable contact in the whole of London. C. This might be a review copy of some ghosted showbiz memoirs that might be good for a 150-word anecdotal filler. One day Elbeck dropped a re-issued volume on my desk – To Beg I am Ashamed, the supposed autobiography of a criminal. It came complete with one of his headlines: ‘IT’S STILL A BAD, DANGEROUS BOOK’. I asked him what was so bad and dangerous about it. ‘I haven’t read it,’ the Features Editor confessed cheerfully. ‘Two hundred words by four o’clock’. D. On one desperate occasion, with the deadline looming yet again, we fell to working our way along Millionaires’ Row in Kensington, questioning maids and chauffeurs about the foibles of their rich employers. This enterprise came to a stop after someone called the police. E. This proved to be a foretaste of his favourite method of floating an idea. While the assembled feature writers clustered around his desk skimming the newspapers and intermittently quoting some story that might with luck yield a feature angle, Elbeck would be scribbling away on his pad. Cockily trumpeting his newly minted headline – ‘WOULD YOU RISK A BLIND DATE HOLIDAY?’ or ‘CAN WOMEN BE TRUSTED WITH MONEY?’ – he would rip off the page and thrust it into the arms of the nearest writer – ‘Copy by four o’clock.’ F. This was for the benefit of one of the paper’s more irascible executives who was a passionate believer in it. It had been noticed that when he was told he would have a bad day he would react accordingly and his miserable colleagues would go through the day quaking in their shoes. My job was to doctor the entry to give his colleagues a more peaceful ride. G. My month’s trial with the Mirror quickly expired without my having done anything to justify my existence on the paper, but since Elbeck didn’t mention that my time was up, neither did I. I pottered on, still trying to find my feet. Occasionally opportunity would knock, but it was usually a false alarm. Not always, though. H. But many of Elbeck’s madder flights of fancy had no chance of panning out so well – even I could tell that. Seasoned writers would accept the assignment without demur, repair to a café for a couple of hours, and then ring in to announce that they couldn’t make the idea stand up."

Wafting from savoury to toasted, fruity to oily, the aroma emanates from the 89-year-old factory of Valrhona, one of the most respected chocolate makers in the business. I was inhaling this heady perfume on a trip to find out about Valrhona’s first book, the fabulous Cooking with Chocolate. A vast tome, it’s a chocophile’s dream, with pages of chocolate information alongside recipes, from the ultimate sachertorte to ‘Bittersweet Chocolate Bars, Salted Butter Caramel and Crystallised Almonds’. Most are mesmerizingly complex creations strictly for trained chefs or timerich amateurs; mouthwatering for the rest of us. Best of all are the pages on techniques such as the all-important tempering (a heating and cooling process that keeps the shine and texture of chocolate when it is remoulded), all minutely described and carefully illustrated. B. I’d expect nothing less from Valrhona, which we have to thank for the quiet revolution in chocolate of the past 25 years. Back in the early 1980s, plain chocolate meant a cocoa solids content of barely 40 per cent. Then, in the early 1990s, cookery writers began telling us to use chocolate with ‘minimum 50 per cent cocoa solids’. The supermarkets started stocking real cooking chocolate with escalating levels of cocoa solids. It was Valrhona that first introduced a 70 per cent cocoa solids chocolate bar to the market in 1986. It caused a flurry among chefs, who found that it gave a far more intense chocolate flavour to their dishes, and it was given star billing on menus. Since then an army of boutique chocolate makers has been born. They all produce chocolate in a ‘bean-to-bar’ process, transforming raw, fermented beans into chocolate themselves. It’s an important distinction, as many other companies buy ready-made chocolate in bulk and re-melt it to form bars and chocolate sweets. C. Inside Valrhona’s newest factory on the outskirts of town, Luce, our elegantly grey-haired guide, leads us past paintings of the chefs who are fans of Valrhona. The smell grows ever headier and sweeter as we enter a windowless, high-ceilinged room with a cream-tiled floor, on which neat rows of sacks are waiting for processing. Inside are fermented and dried beans, but the dull brown seeds have a long way to go before they can live up to their botanical name, Theobroma: ‘food of the gods’. In the next room that process is beginning, as the beans are roasted in huge rotating drums, then cooled and crushed to peppercorn-sized pieces. Just across the room, a lone worker is supervising the grinding of the nibs through pairs of rollers. It’s this powder, he explains, which constitutes the ‘cocoa solids’ in the chocolate bar, and is mixed with extra cocoa butter (the fatty component of the cocoa bean), sugar, vanilla and emulsifier, usually soya lecithin, to make plain chocolate. Milk chocolate has milk powder added as well. They are ground together to make a paste refined to grains no bigger than 17 microns - the tongue can detect nothing below 20 microns. All the machines are thickly coated with cream-coloured paint and have a vintage air, like a ship’s engine room. It turns out they date from the 1960s. ‘We bought modern ones, which were much more efficient, but they just didn’t produce such good chocolate, so we went back to these,’ explains Luce, as we head to the conching machines. These huge mixers stir the chocolate ingredients for up to three days, combining them at 60-70C and developing the flavours. D. But can a bar ever contain too much cocoa solids? I ask Pierre Costet, head taster for Valrhona, over a table of chocolate samples. “Yes’. The blend of beans with cocoa butter and sugar should vary according to the subtleties of the flavour. Costet also believes the merits of the three varieties of cacao bean are exaggerated. It is widely accepted that Criollo (mostly from Venezuela) is the connoisseur’s choice and Trinitario, grown in South and Central America, is the best mainstream variety. Forestero, grown in Africa, is considered coarse, mass-market stuff. This, Costet tells me, is too simplistic. First, because cacao trees are grown from seed by the farmers, they may have been cross-pollinated with the other varieties anyway. Second, how the beans are grown and fermented makes a huge difference, so a well-looked-after Forestero may well be better than a poorly treated Criollo."

Unsustainable tourism We are increasingly familiar with some of the worst effects of unthinking, unmanaged, unsustainable tourism: previously undeveloped coastal villages that have become sprawling, charmless towns, their seas poisoned by sewage, denuded of wildlife, their beaches stained with litter and tubes of suncream; and historic towns, their streets now choked with traffic, their temples, churches and cathedrals seemingly reduced to a backdrop for holiday snaps that proclaim, ‘Been there, Done that’. Less appreciated, perhaps, is the social dislocation unsustainable tourism can cause: once-cohesive communities disrupted as the holiday industry replaces old crafts, turning fishermen into tour boat operators and farmers into fast-food store waiters or hotel cleaners. Criticism of the tourism industry Although its strongest critics view the tourism industry as a rapacious predator — moving on to fresh conquests after one environment has been spoiled, and forever fuelling the desires of holidaymakers with the prospect of a new paradise that must be enjoyed ‘before it’s gone’ - there are many within the industry who reject the claim. They are at least partly right. There are examples where the travel trade is doing better. Of course, reforming initiatives often come after the damage has been done and in some cases for public relations purposes rather than from a commitment to sustainability. Write your essay."

Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Paul watched the television above the bar. An army of turtles waddled up a beach, cumbersome helmets dragged through the fine sand to deposit a clutch of smooth, white eggs in the dunes. He saw the wriggling reptilian babies emerge sticky from the broken shells and repeat the journey in reverse, thousands of tiny helmets trundling inexorably over the moonlit dunes towards the breakers. Those who escaped being flipped over on their backs and pecked to death by wading birds were finally swallowed up in the surf. There was no pleasure involved in this reptilian cycle of birth and death. The turtles survived purely because there were so many of them, and the oceans were so vast, that one or two were bound to slip through unnoticed. He wondered why they bothered, and presumed it could only be because they had no choice. Their genes forced them ever onwards - life would not be denied. Previous generations had imposed their will upon their distant descendants, and the descendants wearily obeyed. If, by chance, a turtle was born in whom this instinct towards multiplication was misformed or absent, a turtle whose instincts directed them not towards reproduction but towards reflection on the purpose of reproduction, say, or towards seeing how long it could stay underwater on one breath, then this instinct would die with the turtle. The turtles were condemned to multiply purely by the breeding success of their own ancestors. There was no escape for them. Multiplication, once set in motion, was unstoppable. At the present moment, the balance of his own inclinations tilted more towards sleep, the cessation of thought, hibernation, vegetation. Had he been one of those tiny helmets, he would, at that moment, have flipped over belly-up in the sand and simply awaited the releasing beak. Parenthood had taken him by surprise. The books, the articles, the classes, had not prepared him for the intensity of it all. Snap decisions to be made, everybody looking to him for the answers, and no way of knowing if he had made the correct guess, no way of finding his way back to the main track if he took a wrong turning. Last night he had been half a couple. He had lived with others all his life. It was easy - you had rows, you had Parenthood resentments, but if they became too frequent or too boring, or if the compensations ceased to be adequate, you just left, and tried again with someone else until you found someone you could put up with. He could not remember how it had all changed. Perhaps it had been the doors of youth and liberty creaking shut behind him, or the demands that were suddenly being made of him, the faces turning towards him when a decision was required. Or perhaps it was just the steaming concoction of his emotions, his hormones, his thoughts slopping around his veins with the coffee and nicotine. Whatever it was, something had obliged him to seck out a tranquil place in order to restore some order to his metabolism. Then there was the feeling that he had been duped - the one feeling that he hadn’t been warned of - when he saw mother and baby together and realized that the reason why everyone made such a big deal of fatherhood these days was simply because it was such an implausible state. Mothers and babies were the world. Fathers were optional extras, accessories. If some strange virus colonized the Y-chromosome and poisoned all the men, the world would carry on. It would not be a very exciting world perhaps, rather bland and predictable, but women would find some way to reproduce, and within a generation or two it would be difficult to believe that there had ever been men at all. They would appear in the encyclopaedias somewhere between dinosaurs and Romans. Future generations of little girls would try, in vain, to understand what it had been that men had done, how they had contributed. What use had they been? He had suddenly seen his role exposed as that of a footnote. The books had warned him of this feeling, of jealousy, of irrelevance and superfluity. They had said it was natural, that he would get over it. What they had not said was that it was natural because it was so manifestly, poignantly true, or that he would get over it only by stopping thinking about it. Fathers deceived themselves. Mothers and babies held it all together. The men came and went, interchangeably, causing trouble and bringing presents to make up for it. 31 What did Paul notice about the turtles in the first paragraph? A their reluctance to return to the sea B their behaviour with their young C_ the effort they made to survive D the tiny proportion of young who survived 32 Paul assumed that if a turtle did not wish to reproduce, A_ it would be punished by other turtles. B it would end up doing so anyway. C this attitude would not spread to other turtles. D this would not come as a surprise. 33 His thoughts turned towards going to sleep because A_ he knew that he was unlikely to get much in the near future. B he had been left mentally exhausted by becoming a parent. C he had become weary of his actions being criticized. D he felt that that was what many of the turtles probably wanted to do. 34 What did he feel he had been forced to do since last night? A accept that he was not really cut out for living with other people B find a way of making himself feel better physically C identify precisely what had caused his life to change so radically D remind himself of how he had felt prior to this 35 In what way did he feel that he had been duped? A He had expected his role to be one that differed from that of most men. B He had not been informed about how women changed when they became mothers. C He had not been told the truth by women about how they really regarded men. D He had thought fatherhood was treated as a major subject because fathers were important. 36 He felt that the books had failed to warn him that his feeling of irrelevance A_ would not fade away naturally. B would not be shared by others. C would be replaced by worse feelings. D would reduce him to inactivity."

Bryan Richardson greeted me warmly, and ushered me into his modest office, somewhat larger than the others along the corridor, but without pretensions of any kind. He returned to his desk, which had two phones and a mobile on it, and a lot of apparently unsorted papers, offered me a chair, and said it was nice to see me again. I rather doubt he remembered me at all, but it had the effect of making me feel a little less anxious. 37)______ 'I want to talk to you about an idea I have,' I said. 'I have supported this club since the 1970s, and I'm starting to get frustrated by watching so much and knowing so little.' He gazed at me with a degree of interest mixed with incomprehension. 'What I mean,' I added, 'is that every football fan is dying to know what is really like, what's actually going on, yet all we get to see is what happens on the field.' 38)_____ And I didn't wish to be fobbed off. 'They all make it worse, not better. They all purvey gossip and rumours, and most of what they say turns out to be either uninteresting or incorrect. Your average supporter ends up in the dark most of the time.' 39)_____ 'Now that,' I said, 'is just the sort of thing I want to know about. I'd like to write a book about the club this coming season, to know about the deals, the comings and goings, all the factors involved. To get to know how a Premiership football club actually works.' As I said this, I feared that it was a futile request, but I'd drawn a little hope from the fact that he had just been so open, as if he had already decided to consider the project. 'I want to know about buying and selling players, how the finances work, to go down to the training ground, travel with the team, talk to the players and the manager.' 40)_____ So I continued with it. 'Let me tell you a little about myself.' He leaned back to make himself comfortable, sensing that this might take a while. 'By training I'm an academic. I came here from America in the 1960s, got a doctorate in English at Oxford, then taught in the English Department at Warwick University for fifteen years. Now I run my own business, dealing in rare books and manuscripts in London, and do some freelance writing. But I'm not a journalist.' 41)_____ I was starting to babble now, and as I spoke I was aware of how foolish all this must be sounding to him. At one point he put his hands quietly on his lap, under the desk, and I had the distinct, if paranoid, impression that he was ringing some sort of hidden alarm, and that three orange-shirted stewards would shortly come in and escort me from the ground (By Order of the Chairman). 42)_____ 'But a book is certainly a good idea,' he said. 'Let me think it over and I'll get back to you.' He stood up and we shook hands. 'I'll be in touch,' he said. And a few weeks later, in mid-August, he was. 'There's a great story here,' he said. 'Go ahead and do it next season. I'll introduce you to the people up here at the club. Go everywhere, talk to everybody, you'll find it fascinating.' I was surprised, and delighted, but tried not to gush. 'Thank you,' I said. 'It's very open-minded of you.' 43)_____ 'Yes, sure,' he said. 'But I mean something more than that, something more complicated.' 'What's that?' I asked. He smiled. 'You'll see.' A. The disappointment must have registered on my face, because he quickly added: ‘| came to all this relatively late in my career, and it’s a fascinating business. | find it more so all the time, and | don’t have any doubt that people would be interested to read an account of it.’ B. ‘We've got nothing to hide,’ he said, ‘but you'll be surprised by what you learn. It’s an amazingly emotional business.’ ‘It must be,’ | said, ‘the supporters can see that. So many of the games are like an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes the whole season is.’ C. He nodded gently. ‘Good,’ he said firmly. ‘That's part of the point,’ | went on. ‘l want to write about the club from the point of view of the supporters, a sort of fan's eye view. Getting behind the scenes is every fan's dream - whether it’s here or somewhere else. I've never written anything like this, although | have written a couple of books. And | am trained, as an academic, in habits of analysis, in trying to figure out how things work. And I'm a supporter of the club, so | don't think there is anything to fear.’ D. As | was speaking, the mobile phone rang, and he answered it with an apologetic shrug. A brief and cryptic one-sided conversation ensued, with obscure references to hotels and phone numbers. When he hung up, he explained: ‘We're trying to sign a full-back. Good player. But there are three agents involved, and two continental sides want to sign him, so we've got him hidden in a hotel. If we can keep them away from him for another couple of days, he'll sign.’ E He considered this for a moment. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘there is the ClubCall line, the match-day programmes, and the articles in the local and national papers. There's lots of information about.’ He sounded like a politician trying to claim for his party the moral authority of open government, while at the same time giving nothing away. F. Not at all. ‘It’s funny you should ask,’ he said, ‘because you're the second person this week who has come in with a request to write a book about the club. And I've just been approached by the BBC with a proposal to do a six-part documentary about the club. ‘Are you going to let them do it?’ | asked. ‘I don’t think,’ he said wryly, ‘that a six-part series on what a nice club Coventry City is would make good television.’ G. ‘So, what can | do for you?’ He made it sound as if he were interested. Poised and well dressed, though without foppishness, he had that indefinable polish that one often observes in people of wealth or celebrity. By polish | do not mean good manners, though that frequently accompanies it, but something more tangible: a kind of glow, as if the rich and famous applied some mysterious ointment (available only to themselves) every morning, and then buffed their faces to a healthy sheen. H. There, I'd done it. The worst that he could do was to tell me to get lost. Part of me, to tell the truth, would have been just a little relieved. But he didn’t do anything. He sat quite still, listening, letting me make my pitch."

The sections may be chosen more than once. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet.

In 2006, James Levine, a scientist based at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, conducted a very strange experiment. He wanted to measure something which goes by the cumbersome title of Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis - or NEAT. Essentially, this examines how people move about during an average day - not when they’re exercising, but when they’re making no special effort to keep fit. The big question was just how to do the measuring - and here Levine hit upon a radical plan. He decided to put his volunteers into specially sensored underwear. This would measure their every waking and sleeping moment. Levine, incidentally, is no stranger to weird experiments. Aged 10, he’d placed 15 pond snails in a glass tank and tracked their movements every hour across a piece of wax paper. Twelve months and 200 wax paper trials later, he came to the same conclusion that he reached 23 years later in his sensored underwear experiment. All creatures have a biological imperative to move - and movement, perhaps more than anything else, is good for us. B. By the same token, lack of movement is very bad indeed. The NEAT experiment revealed that lean people burn around 350 more calories a day just by fidgeting, pacing about, or walking to the coffee machine. As for the non-lean ones, they just sat there, getting ever more bloated and unfit. Sitting down, Levine concluded, is not just bad for people - it’s a killer. This may seem a bit drastic, but Levine isn’t the only scientist who reckons that being sedentary offers an accelerated route to an early grave. However, the vast majority of us move about less and less. As labour-intensive jobs disappear, we live in an increasingly sedentary world, spending our working lives stuck in a chair and ever larger amounts of our leisure time too. We know that exercise is good for us and that sitting down all day isn’t - we just choose to ignore it. C. Soon after the end of the Second World War, a British health researcher called Jerry Morris set up a study to examine why record numbers of people were dying of heart attacks. The first results Morris got in were from London busmen. Immediately, he saw that there was a striking difference: drivers were twice as likely to suffer a heart attack as conductors. To begin with, this didn’t make sense. After all, they were much the same age, ate much the same food and so on. There was only one key difference. Whereas the drivers spent their days behind the wheel, conductors spent theirs running up and down the stairs. Morris thought he might be on to something, but it was still too early to say: he had to wait for other data to arrive. Then came the figures for postal workers. These were strikingly similar to the bus drivers: the postmen who delivered the mail by bike and on foot had markedly fewer heart attacks than the ones who served behind counters. His paper, ‘Coronary Heart-disease and Physical Activity of Work’, D Two hundred years ago, people was published in 1953 - and greeted with hoots of derision by his peers. But Morris, as people slowly began to concede, was onto something. D. Two hundred years ago, people may have led much less sedentary lives, but they still had an inkling that sitting down wasn’t doing them any good. No one seems to know exactly when the standing desk was invented, but by the mid 19th century, they were a regular fixture in the offices and homes of the rich. But if people could get used to working standing up, could they go one step further? One evening in 2007, Levine was in his office thinking about the relationship between exercise and fitness when he had an idea. Instead of people nipping off to the gym and then coming back to slump at their desks, maybe they could exercise at the same time as working. Sliding a hospital tray on top of a treadmill, Levine set it to a modest 2mph. To his surprise, he found he could work perfectly easily while he was walking along. He could type, make phone calls and do almost everything that he normally did sitting down. Yet after an hour, he’d burned off more than 100 calories. It was, as he admits, an eccentric invention. ‘There was a notion floating about that I had completely flipped.’ But television stations began doing news reports, and all at once people didn’t think he was so nutty after all. Soon, the treadmill desk, or Walkstation as it was called, had gone into commercial production."

The birth of ‘youth culture’ In the early 1960s, a new wave of romantic enthusiasm and innovation - political, spiritual and cultural, or rather, countercultural - broke over the Western world. At first, only a few social and aesthetic radicals were involved in what presently came to be called the Youth Culture. The majority of right-thinking persons were offended or bored by the new music, the new art and the new politics, but a shrewd student of fashion, observing what was being worn on the streets of Europe and America, might have predicted that in a few years youth would be adored and emulated everywhere; that, indeed, simply to be under 30 would be accounted a virtue. What is ‘youth culture’? It has been arqued that the ‘youth culture’ that began in the 1960s was the product of manipulation of impressionable young people by commercial interests, that youth culture is really no more than the range of products available specifically for the young. Others have tried to explain youth subcultures, not in terms of mindless consumption but in terms of genuine style innovation, and the generation of styles which ‘say’ something about the social and economic conditions in which those young people live, their experiences and their aspirations.

It was - at least as far as that catholic and capacious category known as ‘light entertainment’ was concerned - as close as British television had ever come, in some forty-one years of trying, to being a genuinc mass medium. None of the usual rigid divisions and omissions were apparent in the broad audience of that remarkable night: no stark class bias, no pronounced gender imbalance, no obvious age asymmetry, no generalized demographic slant. It was also, of course, an extraordinary night for the two stars of the show: Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise - by far the most illustrious, and the bestloved, double-act that Britain has ever produced. Exceptionally professional yet endearingly personable, they were wonderful together as partners, as friends, as almost a distinct entity: not ‘Morecambe and Wise’ but ‘Morecambewise’ There was Eric and there was Ernie: one of them an idiot, the other a bigger idiot, each of them half a star, together a whole star, forever hopeful of that ‘brand new, bright tomorrow’ that they sang about at the end of each show. True, Eric would often slap Ernie smartly on the cheeks, but they clearly thought the world of each other, and the world thought a great deal of them, too. Their show succeeded in attracting such a massive following on that memorable night because it had, over the course of the previous nine years or so, established, and then enhanced, an enviable reputation for consistency, inventiveness, unparalleled professional polish and, last but by no means least, a strong and sincere respect for its audience. The Morecambe & Wise Show stood for something greater, something far more precious, than mere first-rate but evanescent entertainment; it had come to stand — just as persuasively and as proudly as any earnest documentary or any epic drama - for excellence in broadcasting, the result not just of two gifted performers (great talent, alas, does not of itself guarantee great television) but also of a richly proficient and supremely committed production team. The show, culminating in the record-breaking triumph of that 1977 special, represented an achievement in high-quality popular programme-making that is now fast assuming the aura of a fairy tale - destined, one fears, to be passed on with bemused fascination from one doubtful gencration to its even more disbelieving successor as the seemingly endless proliferation of new channels and novel forms of distraction continue to divide and disperse the old mass audience in the name of that remorseless quest for ‘quality demographics’ and ‘niche audiences’ The Morecambe & Wise Show appearcd at a time before home video, before satellite dishes and cable technology, before the dawning of the digital revolution, a time when it was still considered desirable to make a television programme that might - just might - excite most of the people most of the time. Neither Morecambe nor Wise ever looked down on, Or up at, anyone (except, of course, each other); both of them looked straight back at their audience on level terms. No cclebrated guest was ever allowed to challenge this comic democracy: within the confines of the show, the rich and famous went unrecognised and frequently unpaid (a running gag); venerable actors with grand theatrical reputations were mocked routinely by Eric’s sotto voce comments; and two resolutcly down-to-earth working-class comedians gleefully reaffirmed the remarkably deep, warm and sure relationship that existed between themselves and the British public. ‘It was, reminiseed Ernie Wise, ‘a sort of great big office party for the whole country, a bit of fun people could understand: From the first few seconds of their opening comic routine to the final few notes and motions of their closing song and dance, Morecambe and Wisc did their very best to draw people together rather than drive them apart. Instead of pandering submissively to the smug exclusivity of the cognoscenti (they werc flattered when a well-regarded critic praised the sly ‘ocillade’ that accompanied Eric’s sarcastic asides, but they still mocked him mercilessly for his use of the word), and instead of settling - as so many of their supposcd successors would do with unsecmly haste - for the easy security of a ‘cult following’, Morecambe and Wise always aimed to entertain the whole nation. 31 The writer implies in the first paragraph that one reason why the show on 25 December 1977 was extraordinary was that A_ light entertainment programmes had been the targets of criticism before then. B noone had thought that a British television programme could appeal to all classes. C_ its audience included people who might not have been expected to watch it. D people tuning into it knew that they were taking part in a phenomenal event. 32 In the second paragraph, the writer implies that Morecambe and Wise € 1Sal A would probably not have been successful had they been solo performers. B had a different relationship in real life from the one they had on television. C were keen for audiences to realize how professional they were. D probably did not know how popular they were. 33 The writer says in the third paragraph that one reason why The Morecambe & Wise Show remained so popular was that A it adapted to changes in audience attitudes to what constituted good entertainment. B it appealed to people who normally preferred other kinds of programme. C the people who made it knew that its popularity was guaranteed. D the contribution of people other than its stars was a key element in it. 34 The writer suspects that The Morecambe & Wise Show will in the future be regarded as A something which might only catch on with certain audiences. B something which has acquired an exaggerated reputation. C the kind of programme that programme-makers will aspire to. D the kind of programme that illustrates the disadvantages of technological advances. 35 According to the writer, one feature of The Morecambe & Wise Show was A the way in which it reflected developments in British society. B its inclusion of jokes that only certain people would understand. C_ the consistent way in which other stars were treated on it. D its careful choice of other stars to appear on it. 36 In the last paragraph, the writer implies that A other comedians have attempted to appeal to only a particular group of people. B Morecambe and Wise usually disregarded what critics said about them. C other comedians have not accorded Morecambe and Wise the respect they deserve. D Morecambe and Wise realized that there were some people who would never like them."

There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. Inspector John Rebus was pretending to stare at the meerkats when he saw the man. For the best part of an hour, Rebus had been trying to blink away a headache, which was about as much exercise as he could sustain. He’d planted himself on benches and against walls, wiping his brow even though Edinburgh’s early spring was a blood relative of midwinter. His shirt was damp against his back, uncomfortably tight every time he rose to his feet. 37)______ He hadn’t been to the zoo in years; thought probably the last time had been when he’d brought his daughter to see Palango the gorilla. Sammy had been so young, he’d carried her on his shoulders without feeling the strain. 38)______ Not very, he hoped. The penguin parade had come and gone while he was by the meerkats. Now, oddly, it was when the visitors moved on, seeking excitement, that the first of the meerkats appeared, rising on its hind legs, body narrow and wavering, scouting the territory. 39)______ There were worse, he had reminded himself, applying his thoughts to the day’s central question: who was poisoning the zoo animals of Edinburgh? The fact of the matter was, some individual was to blame. Somebody cruel and calculating and so far missed by surveillance cameras and keepers alike. 40)______ Meantime, as senior staff had indicated, the irony was that the poisoner had actually been good for business. There’d been no copycat offences yet, but Rebus wondered how long that would last. 41)______ As a child, his roll-call of pets had seen more than its fair share of those listed ‘Missing in Action’ or ‘Killed in the Line of Duty’. His tortoise had absconded, despite having its owner’s name painted on its shell; several budgies had failed to reach maturity; and ill-health had plagued his only goldfish. Living as he did in a tenement flat, he’d never been tempted in adulthood by the thought of a cat or dog. He’d tried horse-riding once, rubbing his inside legs raw in the process and vowing afterwards that the closest he’d come in future to the noble beast would be on a betting slip. 42)______ Except the animals wouldn’t share a human’s curiosity. They would be unmoved by any display of agility or tenderness, would fail to comprehend that some game was being played. Animals would not build zoos, would have no need of them. Rebus was wondering why humans needed them. The place suddenly became ridiculous to him, a chunk of prime Edinburgh real estate given over to the unreal … And then he saw the camera. 43)______ Rebus knew the man. Hadn’t seen him in probably four years but couldn’t forget eyes like that. Rebus sought for a name, at the same time reaching into his pocket for his radio. The photographer caught the movement, eyes turning to match Rebus’s gaze. Recognition worked both ways. And then the man was off, walking briskly downhill. Rebus yanked out his radio.  A) He moved away from it, but not too far, and proceeded to untie and tie a shoelace, which was his way of marking the quarter-hours. Zoos and the like had never held any fascination for him. B) Rebus looked away, turning in the direction of its subjects: children. Children leaning into the meerkat enclosure. All you could see were shoe-soles and legs, and the backs of skirts and T-shirts and jerseys. C) Past a restaurant and cafeteria, past couples holding hands and children attacking ice-creams. Peccaries, otters, pelicans. It was all downhill, for which Rebus was thankful. The walkway narrowed just at the point where the crowd thickened. Rebus wasn’t sure what was causing the bottleneck, then heard cheers and applause. D) Two more then followed it, appearing from their burrow, circling, noses to the ground. They paid little attention to the silent figure seated on the low wall of their enclosure; passed him time and again as they explored the same orbit of hard-packed earth, jumping back only when he lifted a handkerchief to his face. He was feeling the effects of an early-morning double espresso from one of the kiosks near The Meadows. He’d been on his way to work, on his way to learning that today’s assignment was zoo patrol. E) The capybara had looked at him almost with pity, and there had seemed a glint of recognition and empathy behind the long-lashed eye of the hunched white rhino, standing so still it might have been a feature in a shopping mall, yet somehow dignified in its very isolation. Rebus felt isolated, and about as dignified as a chimpanzee. F) Police had a vague description, and spot-checks were being made of visitors’ bags and coat pockets, but what everyone really wanted - except perhaps the media - was to have someone in custody, preferably with the tainted tidbits locked away as evidence. G) On the other hand, he’d liked the meerkats, for a mixture of reasons: the resonance of their name; the low comedy of their rituals; their instinct for self-preservation. Kids were dangling over the wall now, legs kicking in the air. Rebus imagined a role reversal - cages filled with children, peered at by passing animals as they capered and squealed, loving the attention. H) Today, though, he had nothing with him but a concealed radio and set of handcuffs. He wondered how conspicuous he looked, walking such a narrow admit while shunning the attractions further up and down the slope, stopping now and then at the kiosk to buy a can of Irn-Bru."

Everyone has a relationship with an animal in my collection. When people ask me about an animal I haven’t done, I then introduce it to the collection.’ Her favourite? ‘The ram. It’s so strong.’ Franklin hand-makes each necklace, bangle, ring, cufflink and pin, featuring any of 14 animal heads, from a pig to a triceratops. All her pieces are made in solid silver, plated in 22ct yellow gold or black rhodium, with black diamonds and freshwater pearls. Bespoke commissions, predominantly engagement rings, not all animal-related, are becoming more frequent. Her clients are all ages, women and men with a bold sense of style. Franklin’s robust designs are instantly recognisable, as she has discovered. ‘I see a surprising number of people wearing my designs in the street, mainly in east London,’ she says. ‘Recently in a pub this girl was wearing one of my rings at the bar so I introduced myself. She was completely star-struck and fetched over her dad, who had bought it for her. I had to explain that it was really me who was excited.’ B Alexandra Jefford ‘My design style constantly evolves,’ Alexandra Jefford says. ‘It started out as a throwback to the 1940s, but even though I try new things I can’t kick my art background. I’m really inspired by art, architecture, design, furniture design.’ Jefford graduated with a degree in fine art, began designing jewellery and sold her first piece, a gold ring, on its first outing, at dinner with a friend. Her designs, produced on a project-byproject basis rather than as collections, include her signature Alphabet series for which she designed a slim font. Her recent O project interprets that letter in various typefaces. Jefford also makes one-off high-end pieces that are more sculptural. Fans range from her daughter’s friends to her mother’s friends, although she doesn’t always want to sell. ‘I become emotionally involved with all my pieces so I find it really hard to let go. There are some pieces that I hide “for the family museum”. My husband says that I work as a shopper rather than a seller.’ C Hattie Rickards Hattie Rickards’ first collection of 12 rings, entitled Revealed, was an instant success. Her second, Geo, a collection of 15 tactile, geometric necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and a brooch, came out to even greater acclaim. ‘The ethos behind Geo is connection and relationships, bringing tessellating or geometrical shapes together making one, for example the Kindred ring where two puzzle pieces fit neatly together.’ Rickards graduated in jewellery design, then worked for Solange Azagury-Partridge, helping to launch her Madison Avenue store in New York, before setting up on her own. ‘I wanted to create a high-end, luxury jewellery brand with an ethical backbone, which coincided with a gap in the market.’ All Hattie Rickards Jewellery is made using Fairtrade precious stones from Thailand and India and 18ct Fairtrade, fair-mined gold from Colombia. HRJ is one of the first 20 companies to become a certified user of this type of gold, many of its pieces having the premium ‘ecological’ label, which ensures no cyanide is used during extraction, which is harmful to the environment. There are no plans for e-commerce, as Rickards believes this detracts from the meaning behind the piece. ‘I am passionate that people understand the symbolism behind my work. I don’t want it to just be a ring on a website. The story is so important.’ D Mawi Keivom Mawi Keivom is known for her architectural statement jewellery: chunky box chains with coloured pearls, spiked gold rings and brightly coloured gems. Born in the north-east of India, 40 miles from the Burmese border, into the Mahr tribe, Keivom draws her influences from a peripatetic childhood with her diplomat parents that took them to Africa, the Middle East, south-east Asia and Europe. ‘I come from a tribal background and having that heritage has influenced me greatly; the colours, the chunky jewels, the sparkle.’ Keivom designs two collections a year. ‘My style of jewellery is very individual and not for the faint-hearted. I have a very strong vision that translates into an industrial, graphic aesthetic offset with crystals and pearls that are a little bit feminine. I don’t try to do something that is for the moment. My pieces are classics in their own right, not trend-specific.’"

Children's games: past v present It is characteristic of the human race that change is constantly deplored, and that ‘the good old days’ are believed to have been far better than the present day. In the realm of children’s games, the fixed idea is that children ‘don’t play games any more’, or ‘don’t have the fun we used to have’. Adults can be savagely critical of the supposed sophistication or inertia of contemporary schoolchildren, and equally self-righteous about their own childhoods. The much re-iterated phrase is, ‘We used to make our own amusements.’ At the same time, they all but prevent their children from making their own amusements by supplying them with generous pocket-money and giving them expensive toys. Changes in children’s games If children played their games invariably in the way the previous generation played them, the study of youthful recreation could be a matter merely of antiquarian scholarship. But they do not. Despite the motherly influence of tradition, children’s play is like every other social activity; it is subject to continual change. The fact that games are played slightly differently in different places, and may even vary in name, is itself evidence that mutation takes place. And for reasons that are usually social or environmental, some games become impracticable, while others are overlaid or replaced by new versions that are found to be more satisfactory.

So how come in the prime of my life, at the height of my powers, I could not foresee what would happen in the Torkelson case? Was I too street smart? Had I been around the block so many times that I had finally lost my sense of direction? Ages ago, soon after I became a criminal defense lawyer, Fat Mikey LoTriglio hailed me across the vast concrete expanse of the courthouse steps. ‘Hey, girlie!’ His tomato of a face wore an expression that seemed (I squinted) amiable, pretty surprising considering he'd just been sprung from Elmira after doing two and a half years on the three counts of aggravated assault I'd prosecuted him for. ‘Come over here, he called out. ‘Hey, I'm not going to kill you. In Fat Mikey’s world, that was not hyperbole but a promise; he got busy straightening his tie to demonstrate he was not concealing a Walther PPK. ‘I hear you're not working for the D.A. any more, he boomed. I strolled over, smiling to show I didn’t hold any grudges either, and offered my hand, which he shook in the overly vigorous manner of a man trying to show a professional woman that he’s comfortable with professional women. Then I handed him my business card. I was not unaware that Fat Mikey was one of three organized crime figures the cops routinely picked up for questioning on matters of Mob-related mayhem. To have Fat Mikey as a client was to have an annuity. He glanced down at my card to recall my name. Lee? Naturally, I didn’t respond ‘Fat?’ And to call him ‘Mike’ after having called him ‘a vulture feasting on society’s entrails’ in my summation might seem presumptuous. So I murmured a polite ‘Mmm?’ ‘A girl like you from a good family -’ ‘Are you kidding?’ I started to say, but he wouldn't let me. ‘I could tell you got class, watching you at the trial; he went on. “You know how? Good posture - and not just in the morning. Plus you say ‘whom: Anyways, you really think you can make a living defending guys like me?’ He didn’t seem so much sexist as sincerely curious. ‘This is what you had in mind when you went to law school?’ he inquired. ‘No. Back then I was leaning toward Eskimo fishing rights. But this is what I’m good at? He shook his head at my folly. ‘When a guy's ass is in a sling, you think he’s gonna hire a girl who says ‘whom’?’ ‘If he’s partial to his ass he will: Fat Mikey’s upper lip twitched. For him, that was a smile. Then, almost paternally, he shook a beefy index finger at me. ‘A girl like you should be more particular about the company she keeps. Years later, I would learn how wise Fat Mikey was. Nevertheless, from the beginning I knew there were limits to keeping bad company. I could be sympathetic to my clients without getting emotionally involved. A lot of them had had sad childhoods. Many had been victims of grievous social injustice, or of terrible parents (who were themselves victims of terrible parents). Still, I never forgot they were criminals. And while I may have delighted in a bad guy’s black humour, or a tough broad's cynicism, I was never one of those attorneys who got naughty thrills socializing with hoods. You’d never catch me inviting a client - let’s say Melody Ann Toth, for argument’s sake - to go shopping and out for meals so we could chitchat about old beaux ... or about what she might expect at her upcoming trial for robbing three branches of the Long Island Savings Bank on what might have been an otherwise boring Thursday. For their part, most of my clients (including Fat Mikey, who retained me two years after that conversation on the courthouse steps) wouldn't think I was exactly a laugh a minute either. Whatever their personal definition of a good time was, I wasn’t it. Unlike me, Fat Mikey simply did not get a kick out of crocheting afghans or listening to National Public Radio. With fists the size of rump roasts, Mikey looked like what he was: a man for whom aggravated assault was not just a profession but a pleasure. As for Mclody Ann, with her pink-blonde hair that resembled attic insulation, the only reason she'd go shopping at Saks would be to knock off the Estée Lauder counter when she ran out of lip liner. My clients had no reason or desire to try to pass for upper middle class. For that reason alone, Norman Torkelson was different right from the beginning. 31 When Fat Mikey shouted ‘Hey, girlie!’, the narrator Ahad a brief feeling of guilt about what she had previously done to him. B_ had difficulty in distinguishing what sort of mood he was in. C thought that it was impossible for him to be out of prison already. D remembered that he had been given a shorter prison sentence than expected. 32 The narrator gave Fat Mikey her business card because A she felt that he could be of advantage to her in her present job. visi B she felt that it would show that there was no bad feeling between them. C she wanted to behave in a way she thought appropriate for professional women. D she feared that there was a danger of him becoming aggressive. 33 What do we learn about Fat Mikey’s trial? A The narrator's use of ‘whom’ during it had struck Mikey as being inappropriate. B Mikey felt that her contribution at it had been crucial to the outcome. C The narrator’s description of him at it made it hard for her to treat him like a friend. D Mikey felt that her behaviour at it had been inappropriate for a woman. 34 When they talked about her suitability as a defender, A Mikey said that he did not think she would do well when defending certain people. B the narrator was puzzled as to what he meant by the advice he gave her. C Mikey felt that his comments on the subject might have offended her. D the narrator said that people who wanted to get out of trouble would employ her. 35 What does the narrator imply about some other attorneys? A They attracted criticism because of their relationships with some of their clients. B They paid too much attention to the unfortunate backgrounds of some of their clients. C They became friendly with some of their clients despite knowing that they shouldn't. D They weren't as interested in some of their clients as they pretended to be. 36 What does the narrator say about the majority of her clients? A Their personal appearance was important to them. B They committed crimes they were not likely to get away with. C They regarded her as something of a disappointment. D It would not occur to them to socialize with her."

    "text": "You are going to read an article. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the article. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Mark your answers on the separate answer sheet. HELP GUIDE US THROUGH THE UNIVERSE Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, launches this year’s Young Science Writer competition. If you ask scientists what they’re doing, the answer won’t be ‘Finding the origin of the universe’, ‘Seeking the cure for cancer’ or suchlike. It will involve something very specialised, a small piece of the jigsaw that builds up the big picture. 37)______ So, unless they are cranks or geniuses, scientists don’t shoot directly for a grand goal – they focus on bite-sized problems that seem timely and tractable. But this strategy (though prudent) carries an occupational risk: they may forget they’re wearing blinkers and fail to see their own work in its proper perspective. 38)______ I would personally derive far less satisfaction from my research if it interested only a few other academics. But presenting one’s work to non-specialists isn’t easy. We scientists often do it badly, although the experience helps us to see our work in a broader context. Journalists can do it better, and their efforts can put a key discovery in perspective, converting an arcane paper published in an obscure journal into a tale that can inspire others. 39)______ On such occasions, people often raise general concerns about the way science is going and the impact it may have; they wonder whether taxpayers get value for money from the research they support. More intellectual audiences wonder about the basic nature of science: how objective can we be? And how creative? Is science genuinely a progressive enterprise? What are its limits and are we anywhere near them? It is hard to explain, in simple language, even a scientific concept that you understand well. My own (not always effective) attempts have deepened my respect for science reporters, who have to assimilate quickly, with a looming deadline, a topic they may be quite unfamiliar with. 40)______ It’s unusual for science to earn newspaper headlines. Coverage that has to be restricted to crisp newsworthy breakthroughs in any case distorts the way science develops. Scientific advances are usually gradual and cumulative, and better suited to feature articles, or documentaries – or even books, for which the latent demand is surprisingly strong. For example, millions bought A Brief History of Time, which caught the public imagination. 41)______ Nevertheless, serious books do find a ready market. That’s the good news for anyone who wants to enter this competition. But books on pyramidology, visitations by aliens, and suchlike do even better: a symptom of a fascination with the paranormal and ‘New Age’ concepts. It is depressing that these are often featured uncritically in the media, distracting attention from more genuine advances. 42)______ Most scientists are quite ordinary, and their lives unremarkable. But occasionally they exemplify the link between genius and madness; these ‘eccentrics’ are more enticing biographers. 43)______ There seems, gratifyingly, to be no single ‘formula’ for science writing – many themes are still under-exploited. Turning out even 700 words seems a daunting task if you’re faced with a clean sheet of paper or a blank screen, but less so if you have done enough reading and interviewing on a subject to become inspired. For research students who enter the competition, science (and how you do it) is probably more interesting than personal autobiography. But, if in later life, you become both brilliant and crazy, you can hope that someone else writes a best-seller about you. A. However, over-sensational claims are a hazard for them. Some researchers themselves ‘hype up’ new discoveries to attract press interest. Maybe it matters little what people believe about Darwinism or cosmology. But we should be more concerned that misleading or over-confident claims on any topic of practical import don’t gain wide currency. Hopes of miracle cures can be raised; risks can be either exaggerated, or else glossed over for commercial pressures. Science popularisers – perhaps even those who enter this competition – have to be as sceptical of some scientific claims as journalists routinely are of politicians. B. Despite this, there’s a tendency in recent science writing to be chatty, laced with gossip and biographical detail. But are scientists as interesting as their science? The lives of Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman are of interest, but is that true of the routine practitioner? C. Two mathematicians have been treated as such in recent books: Paul Erdos, the obsessive itinerant Hungarian (who described himself as ‘a machine for turning coffee into theorems’) and John Nash, a pioneer of game theory, who resurfaced in his sixties, after 30 years of insanity, to receive a Nobel prize. D. For example, the American physicist Robert Wilson spent months carrying out meticulous measurements with a microwave antenna which eventually revealed the ‘afterglow of creation’ – the ‘echo’ of the Big Bang with which our universe began. Wilson was one of the rare scientists with the luck and talent to make a really great discovery, but afterwards he acknowledged that its importance didn’t sink in until he read a ‘popular’ description of it in the New York Times. E. More surprising was the commercial success of Sir Roger Penrose’s The Emperor’s New Mind. This is a fascinating romp through Penrose’s eclectic enthusiasms – enjoyable and enlightening. But it was a surprising best seller, as much of it is heavy going. The sales pitch ‘great scientist says mind is more than a mere machine’ was plainly alluring. Many who bought it must have got a nasty surprise when they opened it. F. But if they have judged right, it won’t be a trivial problem – indeed it will be the most difficult that they are likely to make progress on. The great zoologist Sir Peter Medawar famously described scientific work as ‘the art of the soluble’. ‘Scientists,’ he wrote, ‘get no credit for failing to solve a problem beyond their capacities. They earn at best the kindly contempt reserved for utopian politicians.’ G. This may be because, for non-specialists, it is tricky to demarcate well-based ideas from flaky speculation. But it’s crucially important not to blur this distinction when writing articles for a general readership. Otherwise curious readers may take too much on trust, whereas hard-nosed sceptics may reject all scientific claims, without appreciating that some have firm empirical support. H. Such a possibility is one reason why this competition to encourage young people to take up science writing is so important and why I am helping to launch it today. Another is that popular science writing can address wider issues. When I give talks about astronomy and cosmology, the questions that interest people most are the truly ‘fundamental’ ones that I can’t answer: ‘Is there life in space?’, ‘Is the universe infinite?’ or ‘Why didn’t the Big Bang happen sooner?’"

Bettany Hughes digs deeper. A. Sharing breakfast with an award-winning author in an Edinburgh hotel a few years back, the conversation came round to what | was writing next. A book on Socrates,’ | mumbled through my muesli. Socrates!” he exclaimed. ‘What a brilliant doughnut subject. Really rich and succulent with a great hole in the middle where the central character should be.’ | felt my smile fade because, of course, he was right. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, might be one of the most famous thinkers of all time, but, as far as we know, he wrote not a single word down. Born in Athens in 469BC, condemned to death by a democratic Athenian court in 399BC, Socrates philosophized freely for close on half a century. Then he was found guilty of corrupting the young and of disrespecting the city’s traditional gods. His punishment? Lethal hemlock poison in a small prison cell. We don't have Socrates’ personal archive; and we don't even know where he was buried. So, for many, he has come to seem aloof and nebulous - a daunting intellectual figure — always just out of reach. B. But that is a crying shame. Put simply, we think the way we do because Socrates thought the way he did. His famous aphorism, the unexamined life is not worth living’, is a central tenet for modern times. His philosophies — 24 centuries old - are also remarkably relevant today. Socrates was acutely aware of the dangers of excess and overindulgence. He berated his peers for a selfish pursuit of material gain. He questioned the value of going to fight under an ideological banner of ‘democracy’. What is the point of city walls, warships and glittering statues, he asked, if we are not happy? The pursuit of happiness is one of the political pillars of the West. We are entering what has been described as ‘an age of empathy’. So Socrates’ forensic, practical investigation of how to lead ‘the good life’ is more illuminating, more necessary than ever. C. Rather than being some kind of remote, tunic-clad beardy who wandered around classical columns, Socrates was a man of the streets. The philosopher tore through Athens like a tornado, drinking, partying, sweating in the gym as hard as, if not harder than the next man. For him, philosophy was essential to human life. His mission: to find the best way to live on earth. As Cicero, the Roman author, perceptively put it: \"Socrates brought philosophy down from the skies.’ And so to try to put him back on to the streets he loved and where his philosophy belonged, | have spent 10 years investigating the eastern Mediterranean landscape to find clues of his life and the Golden Age of Athens’. Using the latest archaeology, newly discovered historical sources, and the accounts of his key followers, Plato and Xenophon, | have endeavoured to create a Socratesshaped space, in the glittering city of 500BC Athens - ready for the philosopher to inhabit. D. The street jargon used to describe the Athens of Socrates’ day gives us a sense of its character. His hometown was known as ‘sleek’, ‘oily’, ‘violetcrowned’, ‘busybody’ Athens. Lead curse tablets left in drains, scribbled down by those in the world's first true democracy, show that however progressive fifth-century Athenians were, their radical political experiment - allowing the demos (the people) to have kratos (power) - did not do away with personal rivalries and grudges. Far from it. In fact, in the city where every full citizen was a potent politician, backbiting and cliquery came to take on epic proportions. By the time of his death, Socrates was caught up in this crossfire. E. His life story is a reminder that the word ‘democracy’ is not a magic wand. It does not automatically vaporize all ills. This was Socrates’ beef, too — a society can only be good not because of the powerful words it bandies around, but thanks to the moral backbone of each and every individual within it. But Athenians became greedy, they overreached themselves, and lived to see their city walls torn down by their Spartan enemies, and their radical democracy democratically voted out of existence. The city state needed someone to blame. High-profile, maddening, eccentric, freethinking, free-speaking Socrates was a good target. Socrates seems to me to be democracy’s scapegoat. He was condemned because, in fragile times, anxious political masses want certainties — not the eternal questions that Socrates asked of the world around him."

Fundamental questions about human nature There can be no single, simple definition of human nature. Many inter-twining ideas in the history of philosophy have helped us to form our understanding of ourselves. Ideas of human nature radically affect the kind of society we live in and the kind we would like to live in. How far do we need society? Is it feasible to imagine living in splendid isolation? Linked to this is the question as to whether we are all naturally only concerned for ourselves, and only willing to cooperate with others when it is in our interests to do so. Are we, on the other hand, social beings by nature, eager to cooperate with others for the common good? The study of human nature Ideas about human nature are of their essence philosophical. They are not simply the result of scientifically established facts, but are general conceptions arrived at through rational argument. They are inevitably often controversial, but the theories produced determine our vision of ourselves. Most writing on the subject is explicitly philosophical. Since, though, philosophical assumptions about our nature lie at the root of any discipline concerned with the activities of men and women, it is not surprising that some thinkers have written primarily from the standpoint of another intellectual discipline. History, politics and social anthropology, to name only the most obvious, all proceed with some view about human nature. Write your essay."

Why animals like to play Play has been described as any form of behaviour that does not serve a function or purpose. The natural world abounds with such examples of animals playing just because they can. For instance, ravens in Alaska and Northern Canada have been observed sliding down roofs covered in snow. They slide down and then fly or walk back to the top of the roof to repeat the activity again and again. In some parts of America, ravens have been spotted slithering down shallow banks of snow, often with a small stick held in their claws. When I learned this, it immediately brought to mind when my children were young and I took them to the park. They exhibited exactly the same repetitive behaviour, happy to do the same thing for hour upon hour on the slides. Understanding why and how animals or birds play requires researchers spending hours watching them. They help us to explain what is often a mystery to humans – are they really playing or is it just part of their normal instinct to survive? Herring gulls are another example of birds that seem to play. Shellfish like clams make up their staple diet but they need to be opened to be eaten. To get inside, the herring gulls have to drop the clam onto a rock or another solid object if they drop it from the right height, the shell covering the clam will crack or break, giving them access to the clam inside. But sometimes, instead of letting the shell hit the ground, the herring gulls swoop down and catch them in mid-air. Other gulls have been seen to behave like this too, so the herring gulls’ activities are not unique. This is where systematic research is so important. More than eighty hours of observing herring gulls has led researchers to discover patterns – or what they term ‘rules’ of the ‘game’. They found that it is the younger, less mature gulls that play this game the most. They also noticed that it is frequently played over soft ground rather than hard, so they are not actually trying to break the shells. The young herring gulls also played with objects other than clam shells. Interestingly, the researchers realised that this dropping behaviour was seen more often when there was a strong wind. The researchers concluded that the gulls enjoyed the game more when there was an added challenge, in this case, the wind. What researchers are still uncertain about is if the gulls are simply having fun or if there is another explanation for their behaviour. Both the ravens and the herring gulls play alone, but social play is common in animals, especially in dogs. Dog owners love to take their canine friend for a walk, yet when they meet another dog, the dogs go through a ritual just like it was stage-managed. Nose to nose, they look at each other over, sniff one another and circle round the other dog. Then, more likely than not, they will start to fight. Neither dog gets hurt, because this is just a pretend fight, not the real thing. In other words, they are just play-fighting. This ritual has been described as ‘specific signal patterns’. Dogs, coyotes and wolves all display the same behaviour. It begins with the bowing of heads – the ‘play bow’ – and, like other signals, seems to send the message that they wish to play. Indeed, it serves another important function, too: it prolongs playtime. This might seem bizarre, but it prevents any confusion in other contexts, such as predatory or aggressive encounters. The psychologist, Marc Bekoff, observes that the bow that is used both before and after actions that could be misunderstood as non-playful. It appears that all age groups of dogs use the play bow – 74% of the time before and after pretend biting; young wolves 79% of the time and juvenile coyotes 92%. One theory is that the playful interaction between dogs might possibly be a form of practice for any future aggressive or competitive encounters. Their playtime prepares dogs to be more psychologically flexible, rather than to be aggressive from the moment they see a dog they have not previously met. Perhaps their playing serves no obvious survival purpose, and dogs and other animals just play to have a good time. Children though, also often play games that have a more serious purpose, as they enable them to understand their place in the social hierarchy they inhabit. It is, of course, entirely possible that exactly the same principle applies to animals and birds. 31 Why does the writer give the example of their children in the park? A) To express their wonder at bird behaviour. B) To help readers visualise what they are describing. C) To emphasise how playful birds are. D) To show how birds imitate humans. 32 According to the writer, herring gulls A) act in a way that is not exclusive to their breed. B) show a natural instinct to stay alive in the wild. C) throw clam shells to the ground from a great height. D) fail to eat any of the clams because the shells are unbreakable. 33 What has the researchers’ work revealed about herring gulls? A) They prefer to play games when the weather is calm. B) They have turned cracking clam shells into a game. C) They discovered the older gulls rarely joined in. D) They still do not know anything about them. 34 The writer says that when one dog encounters another, A) they imitate each other's movements. B) they continue walking together. C) they start to fight with each other. D) they behave in a fixed and expected way. 35 The writer refers to ‘specific signal patterns’ (line 29) to illustrate that they A) present dogs with the opportunity to fight. B) protract the predatory phase of the ritual. C) prevent dogs from misreading the situation. D) prove dogs have similar behaviour patterns. 36 What is the writer’s attitude towards animals and birds playing? A) He considers it plausible that through play they find their place in their community. B) He is uncertain how it contributes to research into why children play. C) He is convinced that there is a real reason for their behaviour. D) He doubts whether enough animal behaviour has been studied."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from an article Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract Choose from the paragraphs A - H the one which fits each gap (37 - 43), There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use.  Can a disguise fool surveillance technology? Just how good is surveillance technology today? Francesca Holt reports. When John McAfee took flight from Belize after his neighbour died from a fatal gunshot wound, he disguised himself to avoid detection. Border guards failed to recognise who he was and for a while he evaded capture. But surveillance technology have picked him out of the people crossing the border into Guatemala? 37)______ As a fugitive, McAfee coloured his hair and beard grey, put shoe polish on his face to darken his skin, made his cheeks bigger by padding them out with bubble gum and stuffed his right nostril to make it appear, as he put it, 'awkward, lopsided and with a disgusting appearance'. It might seem rather theatrical, but it worked and enabled him to escape. 38)______ However, McAfee would probably still have not been caught using today’s technology, as facial recognition technology is still not good enough to do the job. Some people have faces that are too ‘normal’ or common and would not need to disguise themselves at all. Jean-Luc Dugelay, a video surveillance expert in the French research institution, Eurecom, says, ‘Certain people have faces that just seem to be hard for computers to recognise. It’s difficult to know why and the faces that are hard to recognise vary from one recognition system to another. But if you have something that is close to the average face, then it will be harder for a computer system to recognise you.’ 39)______ Face detection often entails distinguishing significant 'intensity signatures' of light and dark spots on a representation that is typical of a human face. When people look to recognise each other, they go by an eye for a face, two eyes, and a nose between two eyes and the mouth. Computers, though, do not work the same way, as they are not looking for physical features. Instead, they look for a configuration of dark, light and dark in a horizontal line that matches to a line between the eyes. 40)______ This feature vector is basically a guideline for a face that can be compared with other similar feature vectors. The problem is that some human faces have comparable feature vectors and so ‘average’ faces are hard to separate and tell apart. The Eigenfaces system has to use the complete face to recognise someone. This flaw in the system means it is possible to conceal your true features from a recognition system by just pulling a face, frowning or smiling. This would not deceive a person, but it would technology. 41)______ It will not be possible to identify a fully covered face, but it is feasible to differentiate one face from another with between a third and half of the face covered. There has even been some success with just using a mouth for recognition, something that a human would be unable to do. 42)______ Surprisingly, research into the effects of rhinoplasty – or nose surgery – on facial recognition systems revealed that it has no significant effect on detection rates. That is on 2D systems. Experimental 3D facial recognition systems can be conned by rhinoplasty, as it changes the shape of the nose in three dimensions rather than two. 43)______ In spite of all the advances in technology, however, the vulnerability of current systems is the simple act of looking at your feet, rather than at the camera. Humans can identify someone they know from almost any angle, but facial recognition systems cannot unless the face can be clearly seen. Most surveillance cameras are usually mounted at least at eye level, if not higher, so looking down fully defeats them as every recognition system. A Not only would changing your facial expression hoodwink machines, but also draping a scarf over the mouth and nose, or even wearing dark glasses would work just as well. It will not work for much longer though, as new techniques are being developed that can take information from the nose or mouth alone if the eyes are covered, or from the eyes if the mouth and nose are concealed. B Then, once a face has been distinguished, there are varying ways in which to recognise it. One way is to generate what is called a ‘feature vector’ – a mathematical representation of the face. This is built up from pieces of hundreds of ‘standard faces’ in numerous proportions. These are known as ‘Eigenfaces’ and created by scrutinising thousands of real faces, using a procedure named ‘principal component analysis’. C It would also seem to make no difference if a fugitive wore a wig or glasses, as neither of these can fool a computer. Being discrete and trying to blend in with the crowds will also be futile, as facial recognition systems can scan hundreds of faces a minute. D All it seems to require in films is to wear a pair of glasses, cut and/or dye your hair and attach a fake moustache. Maybe a hat, too. This low-tech disguise never seems to fail in the movies. John McAfee adopted some of these techniques and met with success. When he was eventually apprehended it was not because his disguise had failed to convince but because he had allowed a reporter to print a photograph of him and the authorities realised where he was. E So how would John McAfee’s disguise succeed today? Despite darkening his skin, which would soften the intensity signature of his face, the light hitting contours of the face would still register an intensity signature that would enable face detection. Likewise, the alteration to the shape of his cheeks and nose would meet little success. F To appreciate the reasons for this, it is worth looking at how the majority of face recognition technology works. First, it has to realise that it is actually being presented with a face – a process called face detection – and then work on recognition and matching it with a face that is already in the system. G Equally, dying the beard and hair would be counterproductive these days, as computer systems look at a face from above the eyebrows down to the chin, so hairstyles and colour are irrelevant. Even if your beard was a metre long, it would make no difference. H However, it might not be so simple in the future. The FBI has unveiled its Biometric Identification Tools Program, with aspirations for the future to develop mobile facial recognition software, which would enable them to access records at any time, from anywhere around the globe. In the real world this means using the technology that is currently available from CCTV cameras in streets, sports stadiums, motorways, shopping centres, car parks and so on, anywhere on the planet, because it will be held on one database."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about four women who explain why they do the dangerous things they do. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–D). The sections may be chosen more than once. Which of the women: 44) was given encouragement by a family member? 45) says she remains calm in demanding situations? 46) has experienced physical symptoms of fear? 47) didn’t think much of the activity at first? 48) is frightened by one aspect of what she does? 49) avoided starting a new activity? 50) had a gradual introduction to what she does? 51) says it is important to focus on what she is doing? 52) wanted a change from her normal life? 53) was successful at a certain activity when young?  WOMEN WHO LIKE THE TASTE OF DANGER Ivy Viney asked four women what makes them do the things they do. A Marlee became a policewoman eight years ago, and has done a lot of work in undercover operations. ‘We had a careers talk at school about joining the police force, which interested me and I decided to apply. (44) To be sure that a life as a policewoman was really for me, I first signed up for the Specials, a group of part-time officers. I really liked the work so signed on the dotted line and became a full-time officer. After a couple of years I joined the Special Inquiry Section, which deals with robberies. I have to do a certain amount of undercover work, such as pretending to be a cashier in a bank about which we’ve received a tip-off that it might be robbed. Obviously, we’re dealing with criminals, some of whom are violent, so there’s already the element of risk. However, I have a back-up team that I have total confidence in, and therefore, I don’t really feel scared when I’m working undercover. It does frighten me when we have to do (48) a raid though, as we never know what we’re going to face when we walk into a room. That makes me more careful, and not being alone, makes me feel more confident. B During the week, Eva works in a shop making chocolate. However, at weekends she drives down to Dover, on the English Channel, where she trains to swim the thirty-five kilometre stretch of sea between England and France, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. ‘When I was young I kept winning (53) long-distance swimming events and eventually someone said to me, “Why not have a go at the Channel?” I thought I couldn’t do it and made excuses saying I couldn’t afford it. Then my friends started raising money to pay for me to try, so I had no choice but to do it. (49) When I got in the sea, I kept asking myself “What am I doing?” It was hard work and I was scared. (50) It finally took me 11 hours 21 minutes and I was told to try it again and do it a bit faster the next time! These days I swim the Channel mainly to raise money for children in hospital.’ C In 2007, although a mother of three small children, Katherine signed up for the Air Force because she saw it as a change from her domestic routine. (52) Her husband was already a pilot and urged her to join. (44) Katherine didn’t think the Air Force would accept her, but they did and she is now not only an Air Force pilot for her country but also flies small planes in competitions. ‘I’m quite a careful and cautious person and don’t think of what I do as dangerous because I always respect my limitations and those of the aircraft. The engine could fail, but that’s a risk I have to take. My worst and most scary moment was when I was flying home from a competition in France. The weather was awful, forcing me to fly lower and lower. My heart was racing, my mouth was dry, and my hands were sweating. (46) I had to turn back and find another airfield to land at. I also race cars and have often been more frightened doing that than flying.’ D Georgina gave up her career as a social worker to become a professional acrobatic parachutist. ‘I first tried parachute jumping in my teens, but didn’t particularly like it. (47) Then, in my mid-20s I visited the States and went on a jump with a friend. I was hooked straight away. I like being in the air and the freedom it gives me, and the fact that you can’t switch off — you really have to concentrate or you put the team in jeopardy. (51) I think I’m a level-headed and calm person, so I rarely panic in a difficult situation. (45) I have been in danger though. One time another member of the team jumped out of the plane too quickly, landed on me and knocked me out. Fortunately someone else saw it happen and grabbed hold of me. We landed together with me still unconscious, which is a very difficult manoeuvre. The accident damaged my confidence, but within weeks I was back jumping again.’"

Jodie goes to court It had been an uncertain last six months for Jodie where her own future and fortunes were concerned. She had had to rely on unemployment benefit since she had been sacked, although she had always felt her employer underpaid her for the amount of responsibility she had. Add to this working late every day, the extra hours unpaid, she had always felt hard done by. Now, however, after having to economise on everything, her salary felt like long lost riches, a blessing before her world had collapsed around her. Determinedly, Jodie had applied for other jobs. With equal regularity, Jodie’s applications were ignored. Occasionally she got lucky and was rewarded with an interview. Unfortunately, being a truthful person - though Jodie found irony in this statement - as soon as she mentioned she had been fired and explained the circumstances, she was shown the door. She could not bring herself to lie about it, because she was convinced she would be found out anyway. Protestations about her innocence were met with looks of incredulity by all of the prospective employers she saw. One had even muttered, ‘There’s no smoke without fire.’ Now she was literally facing her day in court. Jodie stood across the road from the impressive building, the bronze scales of justice on the roof glinting in the morning sun. Thoughts were swirling around her head and she realised how nervous she was. No, not nervous! Her over-riding emotion was fear. She was terrified. She had never set foot in a courtroom before, and here she was on trial for a crime she had not committed. Embezzlement was a sordid word to her mind and she had heard it ever since the two plain clothes detectives had knocked on her door one Friday evening and accused her of it. They had taken her to the police station, fingerprinted her, taken a statement and formally charged her. They had not been impolite, but it was quite obvious they had not believed anything she said. Jodie had immediately made an appointment with the family solicitor. Mr Hardcastle had known Jodie all her life, and to say the elderly man was shocked was an understatement. He spluttered and humph-ed for a few minutes, but then he was all business. He was a wise and clever man who asked her for every detail. He then engaged a lawyer who was steadily building a reputation as an astute court practitioner. Jodie had met him twice. The first time she had found him extremely intimidating. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Sir James Fitzgerald had attended Eton and Oxford, but was no wastrel. Despite his background, he was shrewd and intelligent, and seemed to thrive on the cut and thrust of a complex case. They had spent thirty minutes together, when he had made notes on her answers to his very pertinent questions. The second time, he had reassured her as he pointed out that his enquiries had proved that on at least four occasions when cheques had been forged, she had not been in the office. Her innocence on two of those occasions could be proved conclusively. One occasion had been when Jodie was hospitalised for minor eye surgery, and the other she had been at a conference in London. On the other two instances, she had been at subsidiary branches and although there were records of this, they were not official enough to stand up in court. She felt her shoulders relax when he relayed this information to her, but he followed this up by stating that if found guilty, she would most probably be imprisoned for at least a year. He had allayed some of her fears by pointing out that this was unlikely to happen, as it was her first offence. She had no criminal record. Jodie’s mother, Enid, had become quite argumentative when told this. ‘Just let the judge try. He’ll have me to answer to.’ Her attitude had taken Jodie by surprise and she had to strongly discourage her from attending court on the appointed day. The conversation flashed through Jodie’s mind, and she gave a wry smile. The day of reckoning was here. She looked both ways, crossed the road, and with a deep sign, entered the building. She spotted Sir James immediately, and with long confident strides that belied how she really felt, she approached him. ‘Ah, Miss Rogers, you’re here! I have some good news. The presiding judge is old Sturridge. He’s fair-minded and has never sent a woman to prison in all his time on the bench. I think we’re in for a good day. Today we will see your old boss sent to jail and you re-instated in your job, with your unblemished record again intact.’ 31 How does Jodie feel now about the sum she used to be paid? A) It had made her feel secure and valued. B) She was unwise to have given it up. C) It represented a fair payment for her work. D) She ought to have appreciated it more. 32 Jodie discovered that in job interviews A) explanations are unnecessary. B) determination is never enough. C) sarcasm is a good defence. D) honesty is not the best policy. 33 What made Jodie arrange to meet Mr. Hardcastle? A) She could rely on him as a family friend. B) She knew he would do his utmost to help her. C) She hoped he would be acquainted with a good lawyer. D) She was frightened by the visit of the two detectives. 34 What was Jodie’s first impression of Sir James Fitzgerald? A) She thought he lived up to his reputation. B) She felt he enjoyed being the bearer of bad news. C) She found him to be perceptive but daunting. D) She believed he had discovered relevant evidence. 35 It is suggested that Jodie’s mother, Enid A) understands nothing about the law. B) has low expectations of the judge. C) expects Jodie to go to prison. D) is aggressive and uncompromising. 36 The attitude of the lawyer towards Jodie shows that he has— A) facts about Jodie’s old boss. B) knowledge of what will happen. C) confidence in his abilities. D) faith in the judge’s experience."

    "text": "You are going to read a review of a film. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the review. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino’s return to form with a humourous western about slavery. Django Unchained, a virtuous but violent revenge western, debuts the bromcom pairing of Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, and is set against a background of the slave plantations in the south, two years before the Civil War. Many people expressed surprise that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, but this is certainly Quentin Tarantino’s best film since Pulp Fiction. 37) ______ Foxx is Django, a slave when the film opens, being walked through Texas in chains in bitterly cold weather. Here he has what can be described as either a fortuitous or a fateful encounter with Dr King Schultz (Waltz), an enigmatic, dapper German ex-dentist, who speaks impeccable English. Schultz, now a bounty hunter, frees Django, by killing the slave traders transporting him, giving us a first glimpse of the mayhem and violence to come. 38) ______ She is now a slave at the Mississippi plantation, Candieland, the property of the repulsive bigoted sadist, Calvin Candie, who is memorably brought to life on the silver screen by Leonardo DiCaprio. An unlikely partnership begins between Django and Schultz, as they set off on a journey to secure her freedom and in the process, exact Django’s retribution on Candie. 39) ______ The end of their journey is at the fiefdom of Calvin Candie, a charming aristocrat whose plantation is a symbol of oppression and corruption of the human spirit. DiCaprio’s Candie is a repugnant character, full of his own importance and Southern politeness, and a fully paid up racial supremacist. 40) ______ Candie’s pretence of being genial disguises a sadist who allows a man to be ripped limb from limb by rabid dogs as punishment. He is an enthusiast of ‘Mandingo’ wrestling – a fight to the death between slaves. The obscene humiliation of this is plain, yet its impact is lessened by the atmosphere of the men who hang around to watch the men die slowly. 41) ______ He employs his glare, language, and a tremor that suggests Parkinson’s disease, to bolster Candie’s abhorrent racism. It shocks to see an African American so vehemently supporting a white man who, despite the servant’s loyalty, would shoot him in an instant. 42) ______ The quandary for Tarantino in general – and Django in particular – is that of tone. The viewer is never quite sure about it. For instance, the scene where a menacing posse of masked Ku Klux Klansmen arrives to attack Foxx and Schwartz, deteriorates into farce when they start squabbling about the size of the eye-holes in their bagged masks. It is typical Tarantino to incorporate this back-and-forth dialogue, and that’s fine. But Tarantino has yet to determine a way to amalgamate humour with horror, which becomes quite extreme in the latter half of the film. 43) ______ Schultz’s way with words and his ability to hide behind the law are hugely enjoyable. He and Foxx were well cast as a hilarious double-act. But Tarantino’s flair and the fact that he has been brave enough to make a film about a subject that few American directors would dream of tackling, deserves admiration. The racism of the country’s past and its record on slavery might not be historically represented in the film, but he more than adequately gets his point across.  A Tarantino’s message of exploitation is such that some bad people commit repeated cruelty against the innocent. This sets the scene for retaliation, because the good downtrodden people and their associates have good reasons to take revenge. Their revenge is justified because they have been aggravated and mistreated. The more they have been assaulted, the more they merit the punishment. That way the audience feels happy and morally assured in the display of violence – after all, the victims deserve it. B He is impeccably dressed, but the overall impression is one of shabbiness, the same as his personality. He is fairly young, but seems middle aged and seedy. He has no qualms about abusing, maiming or killing his slaves, sometimes in the most brutal manner and takes pleasure in watching them suffer. C The film is to some extent based on the Django westerns of the 1960s, featuring Franco Nero, as well as the infamous Mandingo film of 1975. However, this fantastically outrageous version operates on its own terms – or perhaps Tarantino’s terms of violence – something of an impudent yet extremely humorous nightmare series of ever more violent events. D The film is worth a watch, being stylish and funny, brutal and superbly-acted, penetratingly written and highly offensive. Yet Tarantino does not seem to have the ability to know what to edit out of his films. The first hour flashes grippingly by but in the second hour the film starts to wander and take its time. At the end of the second hour an ending seems to be in sight, but a further three-quarters of an hour continues the bedlam with the audience squirming in their seats. E Despite an impeccable line up of stars, the one who outshines the rest and totally upstages them is Samuel L. Jackson, who gives the performance of his life as Stephen, Candie’s household attendant, a sort of Uncle Tom character, who is wholly and belligerently devoted to his master. F And so it ends fatally for the slavers, but Schultz has found his man, as Django agrees to help him hunt down three outlaws in exchange for his freedom. Bounty-hunting, Schultz explains, is ‘a flesh-for-cash business’, just like slavery. Django is also seeking his wife, a German-speaking slave named – to Schultz’s surprise – Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Like Django she was a runaway, and is branded on the face with a telltale R. G Tarantino makes all of this glaringly obvious and keeps reminding the viewer, something that only he and Jackson could have carried off in the Stephen character. It is cringe making when watched, especially when so few films in Hollywood deal with the subject of slavery, except from the point of view of abolition. Tarantino is more than willing to deal with the subject matter head on, warts and all. H In a surprisingly unpatronising manner, during their travels Schultz instils in Django a feeling of his own independence, concentrating his antagonism against those who have misused him, and showing Django why he should show them no mercy. The German teaches him such practical things as how to handle a gun and shoot accurately, how to read, as well as the more subtle arts of role-playing, being patient and also biding his time to take revenge."

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article about six young girls who have achieved success as designers while still in their teens. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections A–F. The sections may be chosen more than once. Which of the successful young girl: owes success to doing something on a whim? ______ (44) is considering expanding her business? ______ (45) hopes to become very wealthy? ______ (46) was inspired by something boring? ______ (47) makes things that are cheap, fashionable and practical? ______ (48) makes a link between her success and having to learn a skill? ______ (49) seems modest about her success? ______ (50) started a business for which she had no formal training? ______ (51) discovered her future career by accident? ______ (52) began her business because she had time on her hands? ______ (53). SIX YOUNG FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS Daniel Crawley speaks to six successful young girls. A Anala Patel – children’s clothes designer There’s no doubt that Anala is going to be a big name in the future. Her forte is children’s clothes that challenge the traditional. Her fabrics do not crease, are washable, and are not what children would usually wear. Their cut and their look is more like a high end fashion designer would make, yet they are inexpensive. ‘At my school,’ explains the 16-year-old, ‘we have to learn practical skills, such as sewing. We had to design and make something for a child, and I really took to it. Before I knew it, a chain store wanted my designs and I’m going to work full-time for them when I leave school. It’s so unreal when I see my name on the labels!’ B Katerina Stellas – shoe designer ‘I’m 18 and a shoe designer. Who’d have ever thought that would happen? Certainly not me!’ Katerina’s life has changed completely and despite her excitement, she seems remarkably calm about her sudden rise to fame. Her shoes can be seen everywhere and now she’s left school she’s devoting herself full-time to her new career. ‘I never dreamed something like this could happen. On impulse, I entered a competition So You Think You Could Do Better and I won. I love shoes, but could never find any that were really different and unique. Now I can, and so can every other teenager.’ Katerina has plans to design for all age groups and is surprisingly eager considering she’s already struck it rich. C Richenda Lefevre – website designer Richenda has no art training or real computer background, yet here she is, running her own business designing websites for large corporations, at the tender age of seventeen. ‘I built my own website when I was fifteen. You know, one of those free ones you can get. It was fun and I really got into all the different effects you could achieve. People started asking who had designed the site, and then my uncles asked for my help to set up their website for their business, and it just grew from there.’ Today, Richenda is revamping the websites of companies that deal primarily with teenagers, and she has more work than she can handle. She’s thinking of taking on staff – teenagers, of course! D Jemma Shuter – computer games designer Jemma had no interest in computer or video games until she was fifteen, when she played her first game with a friend. She talks now like she’s been doing it all her life. She found the game repetitive and dull and thought she could improve on it. She spent six months in the evenings and at weekends working on it, but didn’t really expect to sell it to anyone. ‘It was always just to prove I could do it. My dad approached a company and now that it’s on the shelves, it feels great! My friends all love it and have bought a copy. I’m working on another one now that’ll be even better. I hope I’m quite proud of it already!’ E Ivy Dawson – furniture designer ‘I was so thrilled when I saw the furniture I’d designed on display for everyone to see. All my ideas had come to life!’ When Ivy and her family moved to a bigger house, her parents said she could have new bedroom furniture. They searched everywhere but couldn’t find anything she liked. So Ivy made drawings of what she wanted and took it to the biggest department store in the area to ask if they could make it for her. They were so impressed with her designs that the 17-year-old is now working for them. ‘I had no idea what I wanted to do after I left school, so I found what I want to do purely by chance. I’m so happy!’ F Ellie Foxx – jewellery designer Ellie started to make her own jewellery when she was studying for her A levels to go to university. ‘I didn’t have to go to school every day, and I couldn’t study all the time. Without much money, I bought some beads and the other stuff I needed.’ Ellie posted pictures of what she’d made on a social website to show her friends. They all wanted some. ‘I didn’t expect anything like this. Despite getting into university, I’ve decided to concentrate on the jewellery making. I sell it online and am sending out over a thousand orders a week. My goal is to make my first million by the time I’m twenty-one, so two years to do it.’"

(1) It’s more economical to rent Renting a property can be the most cost-effective choice if you are not planning to stay in one area for any length of time, and involves much less risk. It is much cheaper to move if you rent; selling a house is time consuming and expensive. In addition, a tenant is not responsible for maintenance and repairs and the landlord also has to insure the property, so the tenant saves even more money.

It makes financial sense to buy For the majority of people, buying a home is preferable to renting.

Another huge benefit of owning a property is that instead of paying rent each month to a landlord – money you will never see again – you are investing the monthly mortgage payment in your future.

    "text": "You are going to read a magazine article. For Guiestions 31- 36, needs hed answer (A, B C or D) which you think fits best  according to the text . Young People’s Love Affair with Mobile Phones Roger Paire is a specialist researcher who looks at why young people seem addicted to mobile phones One thing Roger Paire cannot stand to listen to is the old excuse that young people were brought up with mobile phones and know no different. ‘This is simply not true. They weren’t born with a mobile phone in their hand!’ He is steadfast in his belief that young people are no more instinctively adroit at using a mobile phone than any other age group. ‘All they’re basically doing is socialising. Add to this peer pressure to have the latest phone and the know-how to use all the apps on it and you have the main reasons they appear to be more proficient — they use them more often.’ It’s understandable that Paire gets annoyed about this. He was the first to study the effect of mobile phones on people, especially the young. He’s been known to speak out vociferously against certain fictions that have grown up around the use of them. He’s concentrated particularly on clarifying the many reasons why the young rely on mobile phones so heavily, having taken a much closer look at the situation than any other researcher. His most recent research has been about why youngsters send so many text messages, especially in the evening, to people they have been with all day. ‘It’s not just a case of communicating information,’ explains Roger. ‘It’s more subtle than that. For example, six out of ten girls text their female friends, just to say “Hello”, whereas less than half of boys do the same. Some kids send up to fifty text messages a day because they see them as functional and efficient. It’s the whole convenience of them — they sort of fit into those small gaps you have in your day when you have a few minutes with nothing to do.’ Paine also investigated how teenagers manage to send so many text messages a day when they are in school for so many hours. ‘That’s easy to explain. Teenagers always try to get round the rules and defy teachers, despite the bans on mobile phones in the classroom; a ban I might add, that’s imposed by adults. It confirmed for me how important texting is to teens, and really it’s still passing notes in class, but via digital means.’ Roger’s research also confirmed that teenagers make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages. Older people are more likely to do the opposite, with an actual call being seen as more personal than a text message. Youngsters mainly make or receive calls from their parents, but texts rule when it comes to contacting their peers. Most young people are constantly connected to the Internet and Facebook through their mobile phone. The constant updating of their friends’ status seems to be irritating and unnecessary to many, but for teens it’s vital, especially as regards their close friends. ‘They also see their mobile phone as a constant companion,’ says Roger. ‘It’s become an extension of their body. Meet a teenager and you’ll meet their mobile phone! It’s sort of glued to them.’ (line 27) Most teenagers I spoke to sleep with it on their pillow or right next to the bed, they eat with it on their lap or by the plate, it goes to the bathroom with them and lies beside them when they have a shower. You’ll find that older people aren’t this enamoured of their phone, and will, for example, leave it downstairs when they go for a shower.’ Next time you’re in a café or restaurant where there are young people, have a good look at them to see how they’re interacting. Every one of them will be playing with their mobile phone, either reading or sending a text message, playing a game on it, checking their online status or just playing with and touching the phone. ‘They seem to be totally oblivious to the fact that they’re doing it,’ Paire observes, ‘and they do it while they’re communicating with the people they’re sitting with. Nobody seems to get upset by the fact that the others are paying more attention to their mobile phones instead of living in the present.’ Paire adds, ‘I did start to wonder if they ever turn their mobile phones off, and thus socialise in real time, so to speak. There doesn’t appear to be any sort of code among them as to when the mobile phone is intrusive or when it is rude or inappropriate to use it. In fact, teenagers refer to their mobile phone as “a device”, a device not only for communication, but also a clock, a music player, a camera, a link to the internet and social media, and a vital and indispensable part of their life.’ (line 39).31 What point does Roger Paire make in the first paragraph about mobile phones? A) They are the new form of social communication for all age groups. B) They form a fundamental part of young people’s social interaction. C) They are not thought of as something to be used by older people. D) They have become a way of teaching young people how to be social. 32 In the second paragraph, what is said about Paire’s research into the use of mobile phones? A) He has investigated several myths about them. B) It has focused on people’s attitudes towards mobile phones. C) It has been a collaborative process with other researchers. D) It has revealed the reasons why there are so many users. 33 The sentence ‘It’s more subtle than that.’ (line 13) refers to Paire’s view that A) today’s teenagers like to annoy teachers just like previous generations B) texting is an undemanding way to stay constantly in touch with friends C) teenagers’ attitudes to text messaging are similar to those of adults D) teachers tend not to respect teenagers’ need to pass notes to each other 34 The phrase ‘glued to them’ (line 27) means that Paire A) understands why teenagers cannot bear to be parted from their phone B) feels that for young people mobile phones are indispensible C) regards himself as someone who must always carry a mobile phone D) believes more research on mobile phone companionship is needed 35 What point is Paire making about young people in social situations? A) How important it is for them to check their text messages B) How they do not realise their behaviour is discourteous C) How unaware they are of not socialising with their friends enough D) How easy it is for others to misinterpret their behaviour 36 Paire uses the word ‘device’ (line 39) to emphasise the view that A) young people have unrealistic expectations about mobile phones B) teenage mobile phone users have no control over themselves C) his research has helped to reveal what the young really think D) teens see mobile phones as encompassing everything they need "

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about friendships . Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A - H the one which fits each gap (37 - 43). There is one extra   paragraph which you do not  need teo use. How and why do we choose our friends? The way we choose our friends is much more complicated than we realise, and probably not very moral. Plato wrote, ‘similarity begets friendship’ in his play Phaedrus, and Aristotle, along the same lines, wrote, ‘some define it as a matter of similarity,’ they say that we love those who are like ourselves. 37) __________ Social psychologists, however, have finally uncovered the fact that people do not retain a list of who owes them a favour or who they owe a favour to, in their head. Primatologist, Joan Silk, expressed the conundrum of friendship as ‘reciprocity and equity are important to human ends, but tit-for-tat reciprocity is antithetical to the formation and maintenance of close friendships’. If these seemingly contradictory claims are correct, then friendship presents a puzzle for evolutionary analysis. 38) __________ The scientists concentrated their research on blacktip reef sharks, whose habitat is coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They discovered that specific sharks favoured the companionship of certain others, and that their friendship continued over time. Other sharks, however, avoided each other at all costs, even if their feeding grounds coincided with each other. It would seem that geographic or territorial closeness are inadequate to clarify the reasons why one is a friend and another a foe. 39) __________ However, Australian researchers have found a third level of social hierarchy – a sort of super group that contained dolphins who were not related. Just like human relationships, this arrangement cannot be explained by reciprocity. For instance, a group of dolphins the scientists named PD triumphed over a second group, the KS set, on five different occasions. The dolphin social hypothesis would suggest that the two groups would never collaborate together, but researchers were shocked to see exactly that when a third group, called WC, attacked KS. The PD group entered the fray to help their one-time arch-rivals defeat this third group. 40) __________ Politics also plays a major part in forming friendships amongst the male Assamese macaque monkeys that are found in Thailand. A very social primate, domination is the only way for them to succeed with the female macaques. Failure to dominate leads to them slipping down the reproductive ladder into insignificance. 41) __________ So could the protection of one’s reputation be the answer to the friendship mystery instead of similarity as Plato and Aristotle believed, or reciprocity as evolutionary biologists have theorised? A Whenever there is a problem understanding anything to do with evolution, it is time to look to the animal kingdom for help. Shark scientists from France researched whether groups of sharks stayed together for social reasons, such as friendship, if they just stayed together because their range intersected or if there was a common food supply. B Forming a friendship based on having the same ideas, tastes or outlook on life might appear to be obvious and instinctive, but that instinct is misleading. The majority of friendships are cultivated between people who are not related or romantic partners, so friendship cannot be accounted for on a genetic or reproductive basis. Rather, evolutionary biologists have usually depended on a ‘you help me and I’ll help you’ scenario, called reciprocal altruism to rationalise the bonds of friendship. C When the participants believed that their point system would be made public, they apportioned the points evenly between all their friends, with ten points being the average. Yet when they were informed that their point division would remain a secret, the number of points awarded to each person was very different. Their best friend got the lion’s share of the points, followed by the next best friend, and so on. D It would seem that dolphin relationships are not established because of earlier dealings, but are based on political motives. Mutual decisions are centred on who else is there at the time. Despite the PD and KS groups having been adversaries, their common animosity towards the WC group turned them into temporary allies. E The non-family relationships that abound in the animal kingdom are very like friendships, according to Dr. Crockford. F One male macaque monkey was studied in 2010. At the beginning of the research, he was third in the group, yet in spite of his good physical condition and large size, he seemed unable to bond with the other male monkeys. He soon dropped to sixth in the group and before long, had tumbled still further to eighth, losing all reproductive advantage. G DiScioli and Kurzban, who conducted this experiment, give a political example to demonstrate the complicated realities of friendship, and not just simple economic or geographic reasons. Their case in point is that although China has traded with America over three times more than with Britain in the past, Britain is more likely to be termed a ‘friend’ of America rather than China. DiScioli concludes that friendship cannot be based on ‘an exchange of benefits’. H This research did not provide many answers, so science next looked to dolphins for help. Dolphins, just like some other non-human primates like chimpanzees, are typified by two levels of social hierarchy: a set of two or three males who work as one to safeguard the females from the attentions of other males, and larger sets who work together to entice females from other groups. By and large, the dolphins within each group are related, so they could perhaps co-operate because of shared genes or family selection."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about historical re-enactments. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–E). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section does the writer mention 44 a near accident during practice? 45 the idea that archery can be good for fitness? 46 a wish to emulate the success of someone else? 47 the composition of the re-enactment society? 48 the idea that tuition is absolutely necessary? 49 an explanation for becoming a member? 50 a lack of proficiency compared to some others? 51 reviving the past? 52 the suggestion that participants had been assessed? 53 the hierarchy of the society? KNOW YOUR HISTORY Tom Bales tries his hand at historical re-enactment. A There’s no half-way with archery. You either pick it up quite quickly or fail miserably to hit the target, despite practising for so long that your arms and shoulders feel like they’re on fire. Mastering the art though, is well worth the effort. It doubles as an excellent way of exercising and tightening up those arm and neck muscles and it’s the coolest way to really learn what it was like for those archers of old, although they of course were fighting for their life rather than a weekend’s re-enactment with other enthusiasts. You’re more involved with history than just reading a book or watching a film, and there’s a lot more to it than just trying to use a bow and arrow with some semblance of aplomb. B Happily practising with a group of people who are just as inept as you can be very amusing, even though it’s mandatory. The instructor, James Montgomery, has the patience of a saint and I first met him at a range in London. As I struggled to pull the bow back for the first time, he explained how he’d left his job in advertising to teach full-time. He teaches the re-enactors, as well as anyone who wants to learn how to become an archer. Impressed by how well-organised the re-enacting society are, he became one of their bowmen himself. He can, of course, fire off an arrow much quicker than anyone else, but everyone seems keen to build up to his speed. C The Great Northwood Bowmen, the re-enacting group, are a medieval archery and re-enactment society. Based in London, they focus on archery in the 14th and 15th centuries, providing a unique attraction in exciting and varied shows for their audiences. What makes this group so special is they are a hierarchical family unit. At the ‘head’ of the family are the nobility, which includes the Neville / Plantagenet family, along with characters such as Sir Edward Northwood. Then there is ‘The Retinue’, the longbow army with roles such as Sergeant Bill Bowman, who protects the Neville family. Finally, there are the ‘Household Staff’, who are cooks, textile craftsmen and women, peasant dancers and archers. D After a few weekends practising, which were fairly uneventful apart from nearly killing one of my fellow 44 learners with a wayward arrow, I was deemed ready for the first event of the month, the Knights in Combat Show. ‘It’s a few hours of marching and firing and then we’ll all have a feast when we win,’ James explained. ‘Just be careful and enjoy yourselves. This is what you’ve been working for and it’s supposed to be fun.’ We all grinned a bit sheepishly and set off. It was soon clear that I wasn’t the worst archer in the world, but there were others who were far more advanced than me. When the woman next to me and I were both ‘killed’, we lay on the grass chatting. She’d joined the re-enactment society as a means of relaxing. ‘I work long hours,’ she said, ‘and I hoped to get away from anything to do with work and meet people who aren’t doctors who talk shop all the time.’ It struck me as ironic that we were supposed to be dead and yet she was a doctor. E When the show had finished, we ate what seemed to be a banquet cooked by the other members who don’t do archery, and mingled together. What struck me the most was that everyone seemed to have got a lot out of the afternoon. My son came running up to me, ‘Dad that was so much fun.’ This was the reason I’d joined the re-enactment society. He hated history lessons at school, and I thought it would be a great way to make history come alive for him, but I think inadvertently it has helped me, too. Both of us have got out of the house more than once for the society, we talked about what we’d learned and upcoming events, and what part we’d play in them. He was now really into being a part of a Knight’s household, and all that it involved. We drove home together through the streets of London, talking about the castle we’d be staying in all next weekend and what parts we’d have to play in the re-enactment, excited and full of anticipation of what was to come."

    "text": "You are going to read a review of a recent book. For questions 31–36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text. Donna Pilkington reviews Anthony Robins’ book ‘Grand Central Terminal’ ‘People who come to New York should enter a palace at the end of their ride and not a shed’ was noted on the 1869 approval for the proposed Grand Central Terminal in New York. ‘The stranger who visits us for business or pleasure should be impressed by the magnificence of the great city upon his very entrance within its limits.’ And in most people’s opinion, the palace still stands today, described lucidly and gracefully by Anthony Robins in his book ‘Grand Central Terminal: 100 years of a New York Landmark’, written to celebrate its centenary in 2013. Robins begins his delightfully written tour and history outside the building, on East 42nd Street. He marvels at the façade, which boasts huge sculptures by Jules-Félix Coutan. The French sculptor created what at the time of its unveiling was considered to be the biggest sculptural group on the planet. It is forty-eight feet high and the clock in the middle is thirteen feet round. It portrays Mercury in the centre flanked by Hercules and Minerva, symbolising transportation and trade. Mercury is the patron god of travellers, commerce and financial gain, so an apt choice as the centrepiece of the building. Back inside, Robins describes the huge, 12,000 square foot Vanderbilt Hall, named after the family who financed the station’s construction. It used to be full of wooden benches provided for those waiting to begin their journey on a long-distance train. Today, this grandiose area, complete with sparkling chandeliers each weighing several tons, looks like a vast ballroom. For a while in the Seventies and Eighties the benches were used as beds by the hundreds of homeless people who descended on the station when they had nowhere else to go. Anthony moves on to the main concourse and the vast zodiac ceiling. He describes it as ‘breathtaking’ and writes, ‘Call it psychology, call it spiritual, it opens you up inside… especially in a dense city like New York. Imagine you’ve just got off a train. You’ve had a long ride and you’re tired, you pick up your bags and you walk out of the gate. You put your bags down and go “Wow!” Just the effect that Whitney Warren – the architect – wanted.’ The French artist, Paul Cézanne Helleu, designed the ceiling and was adamant that electric light bulbs, a major innovation at the time, be used for the twinkling stars. His interpretation of the zodiac is inaccurate, but restoration saw it faithfully returned to its former glory and Anthony is at pains in his book to point out that no one seems concerned that it is incorrect – they just admire its beauty. Robins explains that Grand Central is nearly all slopes and ramps, apart from the two grand staircases, styled on those in the Paris Opera House. Anthony writes rather enthusiastically about the slopes and the way gravity produces movement and circulation. As he writes, ‘The floor is mad at us – it wants us to get moving!’ Robins returns to explore further the right staircase with its Italian marble water fountain beneath it. He describes how ornate it is, encumbered with acorns and oak leaves and tells the reader that the Vanderbilts were without a family crest, but Cornelius Vanderbilt often quoted the saying ‘From little acorns mighty oak trees grow’, and so used the emblems in structures he funded. Anthony graphically describes the arrivals area, building an image in your mind of people of years past waiting for their loved ones to disembark from a train. Known as the ‘kissing gallery’, the original board where the arrival times of trains were chalked up, is now behind protective glass, forever frozen in time. A news stand now occupies most of this space, but despite the time Anthony says it takes to find it, he believes it is worth stopping to have a peek at. In fact, Robins claims there are many ‘secret’ areas of the station that passengers rushing through fail to see, yet they are hidden in plain sight. When reading Robins’ book, he often brings to mind Eric Hobsbawm, one of the most gifted and fearless historians of the 20th century, who with a wonderful way with words and a marvellous sense of timing. With Robins guiding the reader through the history of Grand Central, bringing to life the important individuals who conceived, financed and struggled to preserve it during the 1970s, this iconic building becomes so much more than just a train station. Just as Hobsbawm’s ‘history of the long nineteenth century’, as he called it, became a multi-volume reference masterpiece, so Robins’ tome will be seen as the benchmark book on the station. Grand Central Terminal is indeed a palace, the Queen of New York City. It deserves to live on in majestic splendour to celebrate its centenary with as much pomp as it did in 2013. 31. What point is being made in the first paragraph? A) Construction of Grand Central Terminal began in 1869. B) The building should have an impact on visitors to the city. C) Landmarks are only astounding if they are huge in size. D) The author has failed to do justice to the building’s description. 32. In describing the outside of the station, the reviewer claims that A) the embellishment can be oppressive if it is too large. B) it is adorned by the largest group of statues in the world. C) some of the façade is plain and without any ornamentation. D) the sculpture’s middle statue was an appropriate selection. 33. Anthony Robins thinks the architect’s vision for the zodiac ceiling A) achieved its objective in being so eye-catching. B) provides an opportunity for travellers to relax. C) was fulfilled by using electricity to highlight it. D) depicts an erroneous view of the heavens. 34. What point does the example of the Vanderbilt’s lack of family crest illustrate? A) What their family background was. B) How important a family crest is. C) How easy it is to invent one for oneself. D) How it is not necessarily needed to succeed. 35. What is the reviewer’s opinion of Robins’ section on the arrivals area? A) The area is no longer as evocative as it once was. B) His description makes it easy to imagine. C) He is right to focus on parts of the station that people miss. D) It is exactly the same as it was many years ago. 36. In the final paragraph, why does the reviewer refer to Eric Hobsbawm? A) To suggest that Robins was not as good an author. B) To compare the two writers’ fondness for history. C) To indicate how important Robins’ book is. D) To point out the importance of taking history into account."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine article about ‘earworms’ – tunes that stay on our mind. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. Why do catchy tunes stay on our minds? Claire Wilson reveals why the brain finds it hard to forget irritating, popular songs. Songs that go round and round in your head for days or even weeks on end, have commonly become known as ‘earworms’. For no obvious reason, a tune just stays on your mind, and you cannot help singing or humming it whether it’s a song you like or not. What is interesting about this experience is that it clearly illustrates a part of our mind that is not under our control. 37 __________ Oliver Sacks, a neurologist and author of the book Musicophilia, claims that earworms are an obvious sign of ‘the overwhelming and at times, helpless, sensitivity of our brains to music’. Music has something in common with earworms; they are both typified by reiteration, and this may be why earworms are so difficult to oust from our mind. 38 __________ Along with the repetition, music is unique compared to many of the other things we frequently encounter in our daily lives, because it is so similar every time we hear it. Roads are tedious to our eyes, and often all look the same, but each time you see the same road, you’ll see it from a different angle, aspect or in a different light. 39 __________ A further thing about earworms is that time and again they seem to have something appealing or untypical about them. Usually they are simple and repetitive fragments of music, but those songs that eventually become earworms have just a small trace of something that makes them ‘catchy’. 40 __________ Earworms also seem to be a part of long-term memory and not just a temporary after image of sound. For example, someone with an especially lasting earworm can activate it just by hearing someone mention the name. They don’t actually have to hear the music before it’s back again going through their head. 41 __________ One part of the slave system is the ‘mind’s eye’, which retains visual information, and another is the ‘inner ear’, which we, for instance, employ to remember someone’s address or phone number. It is the latter which appears to get weighed down with earworms. 42 __________ Freud claimed that our minds are not one unity, and today’s cognitive neuroscience agrees, though it varies on some of the specifics. The point is that our awareness of ourselves is far from being the only thing teeming in our minds. The mind is a place of which we do not have total control nor complete knowledge. 43 __________ One psychologist has proposed singing other songs that are quite similar to your earworm, using the theory that an earworm continues to exist in your mind because of its idiosyncrasy and your inner ear. By wiping out the individuality of the memory that is the earworm, either it will disappear or be replaced by yet another earworm. A Earworms are musical memories that get set in a loop and play a specific verse or line, over and over again and never get to the end of the song. A few people have said that if they sing the earworm to the very end, it can help stop it playing in your head. However, others have reported this is absolutely no help at all, and in fact might make it worse by more of the song rather than less being repeated mentally. B Maybe that is the reason why they haunt our memory, and are so difficult to forget. If they were the normal run of the mill song, they would be drummed out by all the other tunes that sound so similar to each other and we’d have no grounds to mark them out as different. C Yet this is not the complete story. Aptly named ‘slave systems’ have been pinpointed in our short-term memory by human memory researchers; sections of the mind that ensnare sights and sounds, keeping them to the forefront of our minds while we focus exclusively on them for a short time. D There is, of course, the infamous ‘don’t think of a white bear’ predicament. As it implies, the idea is not to think about a white bear, but just try it for yourself. You face the irony of attempting to block your mind of all thoughts of a white bear whilst at the same time confirming you are not thinking of a white bear – you are conjuring up an image of precisely the thing you are trying not to think of. So the only solution is to do something else to circumvent both thinking of the white bear and not thinking of the white bear. Something like the inner ear, really. "

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a book about changing technology. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–E). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section are the following mentioned: 44 the ability to type without touching a keyboard? 45 the possibility that the mouse will become obsolete? 46 instructions being carried out using signals? 47 the potential to complete a task using something other than a computer? 48 the global contrasts and aspects of different cultures? 49 an item of technology that virtually no longer exists? 50 the prediction that computer screens will become less widely used? 51 visual instructions are all that is needed? 52 there are many new technologies planned for the future? 53 certain actions are not suitable for a work environment? THE CHANGING FACE OF TECHNOLOGY The end for keyboards and mice? A Over the past few decades, technology, particularly the computer, has had an effect on all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the computer has expanded its capabilities in the realm of what it can do for humans through connection to the Internet. It brings us images and news from all corners of the world, images of distant parts of the solar system, social media opportunities, the chance to buy products from anywhere on Earth, an infinite number of facts at our fingertips, as well as being the means of capturing any aspect of life around the world. Yet despite the technology for computers and the Internet changing on practically a daily basis, throughout it all they have relied heavily on the keyboard and mouse. Indeed, with a few noteworthy exceptions, it is noticeable just how little the way we interact with computers has changed over the years. The keyboard and mouse may, however, be about to be made redundant, as there are a host of new ideas in the pipeline to simplify the way we use a computer. B Already the widespread use of touchscreen technology has started to erode the use of the keyboard, but not entirely. One new idea on the drawing board is to incorporate technologies that already exist, such as screens and computers, into everyday objects. This is known as ‘tangible computing’ and would allow anyone to cooperate with computers using physical things, rather than through a device such as a keyboard. For instance, you could specify which move you want to make on a chessboard to a computer, by physically moving a piece on a real board. This would negate the need to use the mouse or keyboard to enter your move. Researchers at MIT are already exploring other uses of this idea, putting forward plans to control on-screen experiences by manipulating real life things, and they are also prophesying wider use of flat surfaces, like tabletops or walls, being used as display screens or by using personal projectors worn on clothing or around the neck. C Gamers are already used to manipulating their games consoles with physical movements, particularly with games such as Microsoft’s motion-sensing device that follows the movement of objects in three dimensions using a camera and a depth sensor. This is not totally a futuristic concept, although it seems unlikely that office workers will want to be using extravagant arm movements to communicate with their computer. Most people are too lazy to use sweeping arm gestures all the time, so would return to using the mouse or would prefer to communicate with their laptop through their voice or tiny finger movements. The latter idea has already been incorporated into a 3D motion sensing system that is placed in front of a computer and lets users surf the web, play games or use other software with just finger and hand gestures. This gadget is already on sale, so not a vision that is pie in the sky, but actually possible and available. D Also available are systems that trace eye movements, already used by people with disabilities. Functions comprise controlling wheelchairs and are a means of using a keyboard instead of typing. Many scientists believe that tracking interfaces will become common, so that if you look in a particular direction or at a particular thing, it would be the signal for certain information to appear on the computer screen. E The last few years have witnessed the ever-increasing influence of the mobile phone and tablets, culminating in the decrease in sales of personal computers and laptops. For computers, the new prospects and uncertainties posed by tablets and their touchscreen tools, and the ability to carry out an ever-increasing variety of tasks, might have already sounded the death knell for the keyboard and mouse. It has even been suggested that we are now entering the post-laptop era – the personal computer has already been superseded by the laptop. However, for the moment it might be best to keep your qwerty keyboard at least, but it would seem that the mouse might be soon as extinct as the dodo."

The smell when you first enter the shop, the colours and choice surrounding you, the sorting through rails and shelves to find that elusive item of clothing that is going to look perfect on you.

Shopping From My Armchair My friends and I consider actually going to the shops to be very twentieth century. We buy everything online and simply send anything that doesn’t fit back. I could shop twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year, if I could afford to. I don’t have to buy petrol, pay for parking and I save time.

Facebook: Are some ‘likes’ worth more than others? Billy Mae investigates the social media giant’s recent addition: the search function. Are all Facebook users created the same or will some now find it too easy to beat the system for personal gain? Facebook’s Graph Search facility raised two questions: can I make money from it, and can it threaten Google? As regards the second question, part of the answer is that what Facebook appears to have created is the world’s first pioneering social search function. (line 3) A search engine like Google provides links, but Graph Search actually provides answers. Mark Zuckerberg explains, ‘Search engines are designed to take any open-ended question and give you links that might have answers. Graph Search is designed to take a precise query and give you an answer, not give you links that might provide the answer’. (line 7) The answers will come directly from a user’s social graph of friends. All they need to do is type in a question, such as, ‘People I know in Australia who eat chocolate and have visited Chicago’, and a list they can sort through will come up based on that criteria. It is also possible to explore what their friends have been doing, what they are interested in doing and how they appraise these experiences. The opportunities that Graph Search provides are endless, both to advertisers and Facebook users alike. (line 12) For lovelorn users who want to find that special someone, all they need to do is search for something like, ‘Single people who like Ancient history’. Facebook has, in effect, turned its data into an unparalleled chance for social discovery, showing us the future of the Internet and proving it is now really fully assimilated into daily life. (line 15) In the past, the majority of Internet users were anonymous when they used online services. Searching for an item or person was impersonal and the responses were based on global trends and the cumulative study of other Internet users. It would seem that companies like Google misjudged how much users want to make the whole experience more personal. People want to know who the information comes from rather than its popularity, and even if this information is from a celebrity rather than the man down the road, it is still of more interest to most of us. (line 17) Elise Ackerman, in her analysis of Graph Search for Forbes, realised that not all users are created equal and the more anonymity of the virtual world is substituted for the real world of friends, status, fame and followers, the more this disparity becomes an entrenched element of people’s daily digital living. Facebook is, in effect, feeding this inequality and assisting everyone to utilise their specific qualities for all they are worth. To answer the other question it’s going to be simple to make money from this new facility? Well, have you been to a shop where the service was excellent, the prices reasonable and there was a wide choice of whatever they sell? Then write a good review of the place so that you will get money off next time you shop there. ‘What if you have never been to that shop? No problem. Earn cash by stating that you have been there and loved the experience. Tell all your “friends” and followers on Facebook and the cash will roll in.’ (line 34) Facebook’s Graph Search will not necessarily be a success, nor only a way for making money and being able to find an audience for what you have to say. It is, however, an indication of a blossoming digital culture that stems from real lives and places. Facebook, like any other business, wants to keep its clients happy by giving them what they want. They also want the public to get it when they want it and from whomever they want it. In effect, the public have been recruited as reviewers, self-promoters, broadcasters and publicists and the public are lapping it up. (line 34) The drawback, voiced by Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski in November 2011, is what enticements this places on our relationships. ‘We have a name for the kind of person who collects a detailed, permanent dossier on everyone they interact with, with the intent of using it to manipulate others for personal advantage,’ he observed. ‘We call that person a sociopath.’ Perhaps Ceglowski’s words are less a prophecy and more of a warning, but they should be taken seriously. The Internet these days is becoming progressively more out of balance. Our relationships and approval of different things alike are services that we can sell. Utilising our sociopathic tendencies has never been easier to do or more enticing. (line 36) Nonetheless, whether it is making money or friends or not, finding your true love or not, some things just are not worth doing. Not if you want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror in the morning with a clear conscience, anyway.  31. What is the writer suggesting in the first paragraph about Facebook’s Graph Search? A) It is breaking new ground. B) It treats everyone the same. C) It can beat Google. D) It will provide an income. 32. What is Mark Zuckerberg doing when he talks about Graph Search? A) Encouraging Facebook users to try the new facility B) Advising the public on how to phrase their questions C) Considering which of the two services would be preferable for people D) Comparing the different functions of search engines and Graph Search 33. What phrase does the writer use to illustrate the possibilities Graph Search offers? A) Global trends (line 17) B) Fully assimilated (line 15) C) Cumulative study (line 17) D) Opportunities… endless (line 12) 34. The writer implies that making money through Graph Search A) is an easy way to bring in extra cash. B) does not require someone to be honest. C) causes friction between friends and followers. D) is just another aspect of people living in a digital world. 35. What point is the writer illustrating with the phrase ‘lapping it up’ in line 34? A) The public are contributing to Facebook’s success. B) Technology is turning people into sociopaths. C) People are enjoying it and are keen for more. D) It is fun to interact online. 36. In the final paragraph, the writer suggests that the Internet A) will not retain all its followers. B) has users motivated by greed. C) causes people to become sociopaths. D) is not considered the same by everyone."

    "text": "You are going to read an extract from a magazine about walking trails in South Africa. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. South Africa’s Garden Route Kylie Briers steps back in time in South Africa’s garden route Knysna is the picturesque tourist focal point of South Africa’s Garden Route region, an area stretching along 150 kilometres of beach towns, mountains and ancient forests on the southern coast of the country. Its clean and tidy streets are awash with travel agents and guesthouses, catering particularly for honeymooners. Life there, however, has not always been so pleasant. When the town was founded in 1882, the local population consisted of gold miners, sailors, colonials, settlers and fortune hunters. 37 ___ However, the woodcutters from Knysna, rural Boers who are the ancestors of today’s Afrikaners, lost out financially on this timber boom. They logged yellowwood and stinkwood from the local woodlands but were manipulated by the timber merchants, and led a hand-to-mouth way of life in remote communities because they were grossly underpaid. Logging ceased in 1939 to preserve the remaining trees and the men who toiled here would have been forgotten had it not been for the writer Dalene Matthee, who wrote four historical novels about their lives. 38 ___ The Garden Route National Park covers 1,200 square kilometres, and roughly thirty-five kilometres west of Knysna, in the Wilderness section, a boardwalk shows the way to the author Matthee’s memorial and the 880-year-old forty metres high yellowwood tree that is named after the writer. 39 ___ It is worthwhile staying there for seven days, to follow the woodcutter’s footsteps on the Outeniqua Hiking Trail. The 108 kilometre trail has accommodation in wooden huts along the route for visitors to stay in at night after a long day hiking through the high-altitude forest covering the Outeniqua Mountains above Knysna, ending in Harkerville Forest. The route passing through Diepwalle Forest, is worth visiting at least for a day if there is no time to follow the whole trail. 40 ___ Hundreds of elephants once wandered through this region, but deforestation and hunting have now decimated the elephant population, leaving only a handful still roaming around. Due to this situation, Knysna Elephant Park, twenty-two kilometres east of the town of Knysna, is a ground-breaking elephant rehabilitation centre. 41 ___ However, if you would prefer to experience what it was like for the woodcutters of the past and sleep outside in the fresh air, visit the extraordinary campsite near Diepwalle Forest Station in the centre of the forest. The Forest Timber Camping Decks include raised platforms among the trees, allowing the camper to gaze around the tops of the trees for the Knysna loeries while they spit and hiss on the barbecue. 42 ___ Imagine lying in your tent where you can hear the forest noises and envisage the old elephants swishing their way through the trees, followed by the sounds of the woodcutters starting their day with a campfire breakfast of coffee and sweet potatoes. It really is a special treat, not to be missed. 43 ___ If walking through the forest is unappealing, then why not try horse riding as a less strenuous way of seeing the delights of the woodland. It’s also possible to fish in the brooks and creeks or try your hand at canoeing down them. Perhaps something more extreme is more to your taste. If so, the National Park offers paragliding, water skiing, scuba diving or abseiling down the mountains. There is something for everyone, whatever their age or temperament.  A This part of the Garden Route National Park is about twenty kilometres inland from Knysna and is very atmospheric, cool and quiet. Actually in Diepwalle, there are three more trails that take you through these mysterious woods. The trails are named after the elephants that once graced the forest. In spite of their size, they could be astonishingly silent on their way through the woodland. They were the woodcutters’ main enemies because they attacked suddenly and with speed. B Whatever time of the year it is, the forest is green all year round. The warm, temperate climate means Knysna is a great destination any time of the year. The balmy winter months on the Garden Route are from May to August, when the weather is sunny and windless. They are sometimes referred to as the ‘secret season’. The trees never lose their leaves and the average daytime temperature is 19°C. C Despite the woodcutters now being but a footnote in history, visitors can experience this absorbing place by going on a series of walking trails through the forest that conjure up the era of the now vanished world of the woodcutters. Windy paths beneath the trees follow the course of rust-coloured burbling streams sparking in the sun. D To move around the park your own transport is needed. There is no public transport. Cars or mountain bikes can be hired, and the Elephant Walks and the Outeniqua Hiking Trail require a permit. These can be obtained at the park. There is a choice of companions that will accompany visitors on guided walks or on other activities in the forests. E Here you can learn about the troubles of the shrinking local elephant populace and go on guided walks with the elephants. There is also an on-site Elephant Lodge with six bedrooms that boasts a lounge looking over the orphaned elephants’ sleeping area. F The port of Knysna could provide safe haven for up to fifty ships, so timber for ship building was in great demand. It was also needed for the railways heading north to the diamond mines, as well for housing and furniture for the European settlers. It was a period of development by the British into what is now South Africa from the Cape Colony, which had expanded from the Cape Town trading post created by the Dutch in 1652. G Tents are pitched on the raised platform, each of which has its own barbecue and a covered space for preparing food, and visitors sleep dangling between the top of the trees and the floor of the forest. The baboons and vervet monkeys are not such welcome visitors, as they always come looking for food. Another reminder of how hard the life of the woodcutters was. H Two other trails, named after another of her books, pass through a wonderland of three metres high tree ferns, very old trees, common and rare fungi and meandering brooks. The longer of the two follows the creek that the gold prospectors would have followed to where they were panning for gold. Another sight to look out for is the extremely rare Knysna loerie bird. Unique to these woods, this big bird is coloured a distinct blue and green with crested head feathers, yet has a flash of red on its wings when in the air."

    "text": "You are going to read a newspaper article about colour. For questions 44–53, choose from the sections (A–D). The sections may be chosen more than once. In which section does the writer mentio: 44 that a shared experience of colour is always unique? 45 for the first time that people might see colours in different ways? 46 what sort of information is processed when colour is perceived? 47 the idea of colour covering a myriad of shades? 48 the possibility of a medical examination that will resolve nothing? 49 that each individual is unique? 50 people often not being as familiar with others as they think they are? 51 that people see colour differently? DO WE ALL SEE THE SAME COLOURS? Writer Jill Adams reflects on the nature of colour. A One of the most amazing things about colour is the infinite number of hues. When you tell someone you bought a dark blue item of clothing, immediately in their mind springs a vision of that shade of blue. Despite the fact this person has not actually seen the clothing, of course, what they have mentally imagined might well not be the same colour you bought. Does everyone see the same colours? Imagine my husband and me at a football match. ‘Doesn’t the pitch look great? Such a rich green,’ I say, and he agrees. Then I am struck by the thought that he can look at the pitch and say it is green, and he will be of the same mind, but is he really seeing the green the way I am seeing it? Perhaps he had learned to call green what he sees as green, but in actual fact he is seeing nothing like the vibrant green that I see. Or perhaps he is seeing a splendid vivid green and I am the one seeing a pale imitation of it. B My concern about our insight into how we see colours is an aspect of the fundamental fact that basically the human condition is one of isolation. It does not matter how well we think we know someone, we still cannot be totally sure of that familiarity. Psychologists who are behaviourists have always held that if you call any green ‘green’, and you can always tell it apart from yellow, and if we are both aware that the colour of grass is green, then it is irrelevant what the personal perception is. This might well be true, but perhaps there is also some legitimacy in persuading ourselves that the distinctions between our personal perceptions are real and that they do matter, and indeed, perhaps are almost inevitable. We might well use the same adjectives to share experiences, but no one can see the same colour grass, due to perception belonging to the person and not the grass. Because everyone is unique, we definitely see things differently when we talk about looking at something green. C A human’s colour vision begins with the sensors that receive information from the light and turn it into electrical signals which are sent to the brain. These sensors are called photoreceptors and the majority of people have three different kinds of these, which are sensitive to blues, greens and reds in that order, and they use this information to allow us to distinguish the full array of colours. So, although we are sharing moments at a football match, maybe I am seeing something he cannot see, or he is seeing something I cannot see. Even if our perceptions of colour in the brain are different, the data that is entered is likely to be similar. Perhaps I should not worry that even though we both have the same apparatus as regards vision and we can both see the green of the grass, the blue of the seats and sky, and the white shirts and shorts of the players, we each have a personal perception of colour that differs from that of my husband's. D The game finishes and we leave. He might have seen a richer green on the pitch than me, but he will not have the same memories of the other pitches I have seen and the people who were with me. We could both visit the optician for an eye test or have our perception of colour tested, but we would still not know what it is like to be the other person, seeing a particular shade of colour. As long as we can both agree that the pitch is a beautiful colour green, we can be safe in the understanding that I see my green and he sees his. Despite not seeing the exact same colour, we have the shared experience of it, and the act of sharing is also exceptional and unique to the two of us, because no two other people on this planet will have the same recollections."

Young consumers It is impossible these days to avoid the influence of advertising, particularly if you are a child. Advertisers look upon children as the ideal candidates to peddle their wares to. They regard children as an empty vessel that they can fill with their wants and needs. Advertisers and marketing agencies are adroit at targeting children through advertisements, the media – particularly children’s television programmes – and supermarkets, where products for children are all placed at child-eye level. They persuade children that there are certain must-have items they need so as to be accepted as an equal amongst their peers. Children: The impetus for a whole industry Advertising exposes children to what is new and exciting by creating ingenious, humourous, slick and stylish adverts, shown on television to a captive audience. The changing tastes of this generation – from teddy bears, dolls and building blocks to technology – have influenced advertisers around the globe.

Friends Friends burst onto our screens on 22nd September 1994 in the coveted 8:30 Thursday slot on NBC to nearly fifteen million viewers. They spent the next twenty-two minutes in the company of three men and women who were to have an effect on different aspects of culture throughout the world. It was also to be the lowest viewing figures throughout the ten-year run of the sitcom. The writers, Crane and Kauffman, originally conceived the show to be about six people in their twenties, making their way by themselves in Manhattan. They thought about the time when they had finished college and started living alone in a big city. Kauffman is quoted as saying that they were looking at the period when their own future was “more of a question mark.” They believed the idea to be workable, as “everybody knows that feeling,” and it was how they viewed their own lives at the time. They considered Friends just a TV show, albeit an extremely successful one. However, many psychologists realised that the programme was gradually having an impact on culture, not just in America, but around the world. For instance, something as trivial as Jennifer Aniston’s hairstyle, now known as ‘The Rachael,’ after Aniston’s character in the series, is still being sported by many women globally, despite Rachael changing her hairstyle after the end of Season 2 in 1996. Then there was Joey’s catchphrase, “How you doing?”, which became popular in Western English slang, used commonly for greeting friends or as a conversation opener with a stranger. The series also had an influence on the English language in general. The University of Toronto discovered that all the characters stressed the word “so” to modify adjectives, more frequently than any other intensifier. Although it was already reasonably common in American colloquial speech, usage by such popular characters hastened how many more people adopted it in their speech. In addition, Chandler’s practice of leaving a sentence unfinished as a form of sarcasm also influenced how fans of the show spoke in their daily lives. Another great cultural influence has been the Central Perk coffee shop, where much of the action in the series takes place. In 2006, an Iranian businessman registered the name as a franchise in thirty-two countries. The décor of the coffee house in the programme has been replicated in each one, including similar couches, neon signs, bricks and the counter. There are also paintings of the cast adorning the walls and televisions that constantly show episodes of Friends. By far the biggest influence is that which Friends has had on lifestyle – an alternative lifestyle representing young people that have an unorthodox domestic life. The programme epitomises the idea that all that is needed in anyone’s life is good friends. Despite the show presenting stereotypical ideas of class and race, depicting a group of white men and women living in New York City, viewers could identify with the programme through the problems the cast faced each week. It exposed a different way of life and developing relationships that are not usually seen in traditional society. The University of Buffalo classes Friends as “one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.” Their pop-culture experts claim that the impression of young people and the roles they represent are well delineated and symbolise a way of life that centres around creating and maintaining bonds between friends, who are in charge of their own lives and ask for help only from each other. The cast also learned how to be true friends. Before they began filming for the third season, they decided to enter the salary negotiations collectively rather than individually. Although two of the stars had to take a reduction in pay, by the tenth season all six cast members were earning one million dollars an episode – something that was unlikely to have happened if they had not co-operated together. They also reached a deal with Warner Bros to receive syndication royalties, unheard of at the time unless the stars owned part of the show. Again, if they had not collaborated as one entity, they would not have received the royalties. Within the programme, all six actors were equally prominent. The cast members agreed not to let one member dominate, so they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards and during the first season, appeared in magazine photos together. They were also best friends off-screen and have remained so since the series ended. Each considers the rest of the cast their family. Friends is missed by the public and media critics alike, with the latter bemoaning the fate of the sitcom genre now the series has finished. They deem it the final real scripted sitcom, which has been replaced, unfortunately, by more and more reality TV programming. 31. The writer implies in the first paragraph that one reason why the first show was so extraordinary was that A no one realised the social consequences of the programme. B people who watched it knew they were part of a great event. C no one thought it would become so popular with the public. D the writers had based the programme on their own lives. 32. In the third paragraph, the writer’s purpose is to A praise the programme for the effect it had on women’s hair cuts. B present examples of the influence the programme had on people. C explain the English language has changed because of the programme. D highlight the inconsequential effects of the programme on people. 33. According to the writer, one feature of the language used in Friends was A the technique whereby the cast managed to stress certain words. B that it affected the way the American public spoke. C the process by which it taught the public to use irony in speech. D the consistent manner in which it reflected American society. 34. Why does the writer quote the University of Buffalo’s classification of Friends? A To confirm the characters’ way of life was not typically American. B To stress the actors were typecast and not representative of America. C To describe the empathy the public felt with the troubles the cast had. D To underline what an effect the programme had on the viewing public. 35. What point does the example of joining forces illustrate? A How readily people are willing to cooperate. B How easy it is to intimate someone else. C How important it is to work independently. D How much more is achieved by acting as a team. 36. In the last paragraph, what impression are we given about Friends? A It has come to be considered a family programme. B It is not a programme that the critics appreciated. C It was the last of that type of programme. D It changed format to become more real life."

    "text": "You are going to read an article about the work of a fireman. Seven paragraphs have been removed from the extract. Choose from the paragraphs A–H the one which fits each gap (37–43). There is one extra paragraph which you do not need to use. The future of fire fighting There have been some imaginative solutions to fighting fires in the world’s tallest buildings, but who better to solve the problem than someone who fights fires for a living? Edd Dale is a fire fighter, who has been putting his life on the line on a daily basis for over twenty years. ‘Remember the film, Towering Inferno? It told the story of the fire in the skyscraper in San Francisco and the epic race to put it out.’ 37 _______ He continues by explaining how sprinkler systems that activate automatically are helpful if there is a small fire, and fire crews and helicopters are brought into play for bigger blazes, especially when they are higher up at a building. The recent fire in the Polat Tower, in Istanbul was tackled in this way, with helicopters working from the top and firemen moving up from the ground. 38 _______ Edd has also been to Moscow, where a fire in the Federation building required hundreds of tons of water to be dropped from the sky to extinguish a fire on the sixty-fifth floor. No one was hurt in Turkey or Moscow, but they were lucky. In America alone, in the space of just four years, an average of nearly sixteen thousand fires in high-rise buildings were reported, with fifty-three deaths and millions of dollars worth of damage. 39 _______ Extra long hoses with high pressure water coursing through them, used with lifting propellers, special types of aeroplanes that are something like helicopters because they would be able to stay stationary, and spray special chemicals on the fire, are just some of the more bizarre ideas that have been put forward in the intervening years. 40 _______ Many cities have tried to take pre-emptive action against the threat of a huge fire in a high-rise building. Sydney, Australia, for example, passed a law in 1912 that a building could only be a maximum height of 150 feet. This enabled the fire fighters of the day to put out fires without any real problems. 41 _______ Some laws really do help the fire services, so I asked Edd what is done now when a fire starts in a high-rise building, and what they would like to see done. According to Edd the first thing is to activate the fire alarm and begin the evacuation of the building’s occupants. Meanwhile, the fire brigade will respond by sending teams of firemen and their engines. 42 _______ Meanwhile, outside the building the fire fighters will be setting up ways for people to exit the building, perhaps using ladders, and they might need to break windows to provide ventilation. They could also be attacking the blaze from the outside. Men are assigned to ensure a continuous water supply, and paramedics would be organised to stand by to treat any victims of the fire and to monitor the firemen. 43 _______ ‘As for the future,’ states Edd, ‘we need laws that can be enforced. Fire retardant paint everywhere and someone on each floor responsible for seeing everyone has been evacuated. The rest is up to firemen like me to find effective ways to quickly extinguish a fire high up in a building.’ A ‘All in all, there’s a lot going on at the same time, and all this is made much more difficult if the fire is hard to reach on a high floor, like the one in Moscow. That building was still under construction, but it was still difficult for the fire brigade to get to and put out.’ B Los Angeles has also been affected by the same fear. A fire code was enacted in 1974 that forces every building to have a flat roof so that helicopters can land on them should there be a fire. ‘LA looks architecturally a bit bland because of this law,’ says Edd, ‘but it’s helped save many lives.’ C Edd travels the world, looking at how other countries deal with this threat. ‘I liaised with the Turkish fire fighters,’ says Edd. ‘We looked at both how the fire broke out, to see if building design could be improved, as well as ways of putting a fire out quickly and effectively. Times have changed now that everyone is building higher into the skies.’ D The fire fighters split into teams. One or more of them will search the building floor by floor, beginning on the floor where the fire has started, looking for trapped people or stragglers. Another team will be actually tackling the fire and there’s always a team on the floor below in case of a mayday. A further team will disable the building’s utilities. Everything is controlled from a central command vehicle at the scene. E ‘As the world’s cities grow taller, we’ve had to tackle the question of how to deal with such situations when we are ill-equipped to handle them,’ Edd laments. Inventors, scientists and other fire fighters have been trying to solve this problem since 1927. ‘So it’s nothing new,’ says Edd, with a rueful smile on his face. F Edd looks at me questioningly. He continues, ‘The Fire Chief in the film had no alternative in the end but to blow up the water tanks on top of the skyscraper, running the risk of killing those still inside the building. In real life we don’t usually have to face such blatant options, but our choices are still as limited.’ G ‘There was even a comic strip, published in 1961, showing a vivid red fire engine hovering in the sky, shooting water at a fire in a skyscraper from a pressure tank on the engine. Very imaginative, but we’re nowhere near anything so marvellous at the moment,’ Edd comments. ‘Ideas like that are still on the drawing board.’ H Edd has spent the last ten years developing a system that could change the way fires are fought forever. It is called Firegrid, a revolutionary approach to fire fighting that could save thousands of lives, giving humans the upper hand over one of their oldest enemies."

In which section does the writer mention: 44 being surprised to see a result in a short period of time? 45 feeling unwell after the first session of activity? 46 an explanation of the health benefits of Tabata? 47 the results of an experiment? 48 searching for something that is elusive? 49 exercise being difficult to incorporate into their daily routine? 50 the success of a person involved in Tabata? 51 how the intensity of exercise makes a difference to fitness? 52 after 4 minutes of Tabata one should feel exhausted? 53 suffering pain despite getting used to the activity? TABATA – THE FOUR-MINUTE MIRACLE WORKOUT Can you really get fit in four minutes every day? Becky Slater finds out. A I’ve always found it difficult to diet and exercise. Finding a healthy way to get fit and lose weight that really works is similar to searching for the Holy Grail. Having unsuccessfully tried Pilates, aerobics and other fad exercise regimes, I came to the conclusion that it was my fault – I have no willpower or motivation. Above all, I lack time and patience to exercise – I’m always looking for the quick way round things. Therefore, the government’s suggestion of five half-hour sessions a week in a gym doing vigorous exercise could be described as my worst nightmare. I’m not on my own. Research has revealed that the main reason people give up on exercise is that they are too busy and cannot fit time in the gym into their schedule, and losing weight cannot be achieved without commitment and effort. So when I heard about Tabata, christened the ‘four-minute miracle’ workout, it seemed too good to be true. How could you transform your body in just four minutes a day? B Tony Sinclair, a former professional footballer turned personal trainer, has been at the forefront of this trend. A few years ago he opened his Tiptop Fitness gyms and hasn’t looked back. Tony explains, ‘Tabata is named after the Japanese scientist, Izumi Tabata, who carried out research to discover which kind of exercise works best. He tested two different groups, with the first pedalling on an exercise bike as fast as they could for four minutes a day. This was made up of eight twenty-second bouts of pedalling, with a ten second break between each bout. The second group was asked to pedal at normal speed for an hour. After completing this five times a week for two months, the Tabata group was much fitter than the second group. The conclusion was that exercising the Tabata way gave better results than an hour in the gym. A Tabata routine can be done with any type of exercise, but the rule of twenty seconds of hard and fast activity followed by ten seconds of rest must be followed.’ C In my first session with Tony, he recommended starting with something easy – twenty seconds of squats and ten seconds of rest for four minutes. I didn’t think it would be too hard, but how wrong can you be? In the first twenty seconds I did ten squats, but that was too few for Tony. I discovered he’s a hard task master, as he shouted at me for not squatting as fast as I should. In the second burst of activity, I managed twelve squats, and by the fifth set of squats, I got to fourteen and my thighs were burning like mad. The ten second ‘rest’ is definitely a misnomer, as it is far too short. After four minutes, I felt sick, dizzy and couldn’t speak or get my breath. Tony was delighted, because that’s how you should feel after a Tabata workout. D I asked Tony why Tabata works. Despite his rather scientific explanation, I worked out that High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), like Tabata, increases your aerobic or lung capacity, as well as your anaerobic capacity – to you and me that’s the length of time you can exercise for at maximum effort. In addition, Tabata exercising builds muscle, and your metabolic rate – the speed at which your body breaks down fat and burns calories – increases in the twenty-four to thirty-six hours after completing the exercises. This leads to faster weight loss. Much to my amazement, by the end of the first week, I’d lost two pounds and by the end of the second, another three, plus two inches off my waistline! I’ve actually started to look forward to my four intense minutes each day. I vary the exercises and split the four minutes up into different exercises to work different areas of my body. For example, one day I might do two minutes of skipping and two minutes of lunges. Or two minutes of press ups and two of squats. It’s still agony, but it’s not too long to endure the pain. I’m getting fitter by the minute and actually want to do more than four minutes a day. A big turnaround for me."

Life in the office To many people, working in an office is an integral part of working life. They enjoy the whole routine of dressing smartly for work, the commute by train or in heavy traffic, greeting their co-workers and the repartee between them as the day progresses and they complete their duties. Lunch breaks spent gossiping with a colleague or a quick trip to the shops, add to the whole ambience of being part of the team. There is always the opportunity to talk to someone about what was on television last night, and even the most irritating workmate has their good moments. The skiver’s charter – working from home When I started working from home rather than going to the office, my biggest concern was whether I’d remain disciplined enough to continue getting up early and work a full eight hours each day. In fact, the problems I’ve faced were not what I expected. For instance, it’s a lonely job and I can go days without talking to anyone – most communication today is by e-mail rather than the phone.
